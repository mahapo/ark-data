00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
we are with Tim who is
speaking with us from Germany.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:10%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.505 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Everyone is talking
about current transformations

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:90%
being experienced on Earth.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell
us about what's

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
going on that
feels so different?

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So this is one of the
most interesting times to be

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
alive on this planet because
planets naturally go through

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:90%
certain cycles.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of them actually
happening in front of our eyes.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we see on a social level
is that a lot of restructuring

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
is being done right
in front of our eyes.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But more profoundly
and interestingly

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
is to look at the physical
nature of this shift that is

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:90%
actually happening right now.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is that the
whole solar system itself

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is moving towards a location
in the universe that

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:84%
has denser energies and is
more packed with information

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:90%
and energies in that way.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And this has a profound
impact on our lives.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:84%
What we actually are
being confronted with

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
is that the Earth core
has stopped its rotation

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and is now actually
reversing this motion.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So everyone at home
can imagine what

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:84%
happens if you have
two balls in that way

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and both were rotating
in one direction,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, the
inner ball of that

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
stops or even
reversed its motion.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Then the whole
surface area of that

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
slows down much more
and more and even

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
turns its motion into the
other direction as well.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
We might not be seeing that
because there's a physical

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon that acceleration on
a surface level cannot be felt

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We see that, for example,
if we drive in a car

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and this car is going
100 miles per hour.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Is that how you
say it in the US?

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So you don't experience
that in that way.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You also don't
experience when it's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:90%
going backwards or forwards.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when we're
sitting in a train

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and we see a different train
going in the other direction,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:90%
we don't always see that.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
We can still move
inside of the train.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a phenomenon
that is based on physics.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But the actual
surface of the planet

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:84%
will eventually come
to a stop and also

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.040 align:middle line:84%
rotate in the
different direction.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine what the
impact on the surface level

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
will be in a physical
and natural way.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
We've seen, for example, that
pretty devastating earthquakes

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:90%
have occurred lately.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:90%
And this is something--

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
some of the natural phenomena
that can happen when the crust

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
itself stops and
turns its direction.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you suggesting
that the crust of the Earth is

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.815 align:middle line:90%
already changing direction?

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yes, actually
that's what I'm suggesting.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So those earthquakes and
natural phenomena that we see

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
stand in relation
to the phenomenon

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that the poles of the planet
are actually shifting.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So we are talking
about a magnetic pole

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:90%
shift that is also happening.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite
normal in a way, spoken

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
from a scientific background,
because the planet itself

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
every 12,000 to 15,000
years approximately goes

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:90%
through these pole shifts.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to the time
when pyramids were still

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
relevant, if you look into the
amount of iron in the ground,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
you can see that it somehow
shifted from one point

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So that suggests that a magnetic
pole shift occurred back

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
actually is happening.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're having
a version of Earth where

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
North Pole and South Pole, when
the magnetic poles are actually

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
shifting, this will also move
towards a different direction.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If this
has already started,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:84%
how will that affect
life here on Earth?

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.315 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, that's
the concern actually.

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:84%
What's the actual
impact of that?

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
If you only take that as a
Newtonian physical effect,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
then yes, those changes
can be drastic in that way.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to
take into consideration

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're not alone
in this universe

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and that reality and
the outcome of reality

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
is also determined
by those factors

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
that structure
reality in that way.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So what we do know is
that behind the scenes,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
it's been taken care of that
certain disastrous will not

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
take place.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So there is a potential for
another Ice Age in that way.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if you imagine
the poles and the crust

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
shifting on a certain
degree, the way

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
the sun shines on those spots is
being moved to another location

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
as well, because when the crust
itself slows down, then the way

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
this radiation shines on
certain spots of the planet

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:90%
is altered as well.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But what we know is
that there are actually

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
forces behind the scenes that
are taking measures in order

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:90%
to prevent Earth from disasters.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.155 align:middle line:90%
And that is currently happening.

00:06:14.155 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do you mean
by that, Earth disasters?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So ourselves who
are connected to reality are

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
actually capable of modifying
and altering reality as well.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So we have to accept the fact
that reality is not happening

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
to us, but through
this understanding

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of advanced physics,
we are actually

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:84%
deciding upon the timeline
and the way reality happens.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So we are creating
this timeline.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So basically,
those intelligences

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that happen to exist around the
universe they acknowledged that

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and they know that the
mainstream population of Earth

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
is not prepared for
what's going on.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So they take actions in
order to move reality

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:90%
into certain more stable fields.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this timeline
that's destined to unfold,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.645 align:middle line:84%
or is it one of many
potential timeline shifts?

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So I'm trying not
to speak about predictions,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:84%
even though I know that
there's a number related

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:90%
to what's happening.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:90%
This is actually 2025.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
This is what the governmental
scientists were reporting.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't say that
calculating those probabilities

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and possibilities is
very hard in order

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to make a clear
prediction in that way.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So it can accelerate or
even take many more years

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:90%
until it happens.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's really
depending on the way

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:90%
we perceive our own reality.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And we take the
necessary steps in order

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
to make it a happy
shift in that way.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:84%
This is also why
I suggested people

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:84%
to save this mantra of
all shifts happening now

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and bring that out into the
reality field because reality,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and we know that
from quantum science,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:31.948 align:middle line:84%
is actually reacting to
the observer of reality.

00:08:31.948 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: With an imminent
dramatic pole shift event

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
of 2025, how can we exist
after an event like that?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, it didn't quite
wipe out the planet in that

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we had a flood around
12,500 to 15,000 years ago.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is well reported
in different ancient texts

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and Genesis, and it's basically
even proved by mainstream

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:90%
science as far as I know.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But those civilizations that
were at that time inhabiting

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Earth, they all
vanished in some way.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:90%
So we have a lost civilization.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:84%
There's no scientific evidence
that those people actually

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:90%
died.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So we do not find a lot of
skulls, bones, and corpses

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
or something even
in those dig sites.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So there are actually
three scenarios that

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:90%
took place around that time.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
We, A, have those people
from 12,500 years ago

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
using their own
technology or technology

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
from other beings
that still observe

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:84%
what's going on this planet
in order to rescue themselves.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.060 align:middle line:84%
We also have people from that
time that went underground.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And mainstream
science is actually

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging that
currently, because recently,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
we've seen a lot
of media coverage

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
about Earth having deep,
underground caves that

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
are filled with gas or
even breathable air.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So for the first time
in Western history,

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the Earth
being hollow in that way.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So as we can see, the last pole
shift, the last magnetic shift

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that took place 12,500
years ago did not

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
affect civilization
that much that it

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:90%
was a catastrophic event.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We even have this interesting
story in the Bible

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
that says that Noah was
rescued by some kind of ship

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and from that, we moved
on and built that society.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of evidence
that benevolent forces actually

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:90%
stepped in and rescued a lot.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
know, those plans

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
exist from outside of human
intelligence in that way.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:10.500 align:middle line:84%
For the unusual case of
a catastrophic event,

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
there are actually intelligences
that parent us in some way

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:90%
and will take care of that.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
They also made pretty
clear that because it

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
could come to
interferences in that way

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that they have the technology
in order to rescue people.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Especially the technology
that has a white outer glow

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
is the one that
needs to be trusted.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So I don't actually know what
that really means, but I think

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:84%
it's relevant to
keep that in mind

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because there are
thinkable scenarios where

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
fake technology could be
mixed into the scenario

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and the confusion could be used.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But we're actually talking about
a highly unusual and not very

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
probable catastrophic
event in that way.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So behind the scenes,
everything is done in order

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
to make this shift
a stable shift

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and a shift that will remain
society in a functional way.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would also suggest that
non-terrestrial intelligence

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is taking care of
humanity from outside.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually
happening right now.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we know that
certain species around Orion

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
are actually using
technology in order

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate the motion
of the Earth's core, which

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
will actually prevent the
Earth from another Ice Age.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So by accelerating that speed
that the Earth core is actually

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
turning, the crust itself
will also gain momentum.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:04.075 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
is non-human interference

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:90%
with the shift.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take
that opportunity

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:84%
to make that very, very clear
that all those people who

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
are incarnated inside of the
reality field and reality

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.170 align:middle line:84%
bubble of this
Earth are very much

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
their own timeline,

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
much responsible

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.333 align:middle line:84%
of putting the right information
into this quantum field

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:27.625 align:middle line:90%
that we're actually inhabiting.

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who are the beings
helping from the Orion star

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: The beings that are
actually doing that are coming

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:90%
from Zeta Reticuli.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's a gray-skinned
species that

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
is not very well-perceived
in governmental groups

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
and perception.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But because they are doing
a lot in a solo kind of run,

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
not sticking to the agenda of
other groups on this planet,

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
but they are actually trying
their best in order to help

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
accelerate the Earth's
core from outside.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.425 align:middle line:84%
And they are doing that
right now and currently.

00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They are
trying to help,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
which appears to be
an act of benevolence,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
yet are being
rejected by humans.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.535 align:middle line:84%
How are we supposed
to understand that?

00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, you can try
to help in a certain way,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
but still your political agenda
might not fit the political

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
agenda of certain
groups on this planet.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So while they are doing this
kind of work on the Earth core

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and on the reality
field from outside,

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
because they know that there
are a lot of consciousness units

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
or observers on inside of the
reality field that are just not

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
able to help themselves in that
way and are looking for help

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:84%
or even are absolutely
non-informed about what's

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:84%
happening, they
are doing that job

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to benevolently
increase the possibilities

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:90%
of a stable shift in that way.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But I would also
suggest that they

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
have their own political
agenda, and some other goals

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:84%
do not match the political
and governmental agendas

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What are the agendas
of these beings who are not

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:90%
well-received on Earth?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Everyone who is opposing
to certain political ideas

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
might not be very well-perceived
in that kind of sense.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't actually
mean that they are

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:90%
very malevolent in that way.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I know, those
beings from Zeta Reticuli

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
are a warrior class
species, and there

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
have been conflicts,
territorial conflicts,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.655 align:middle line:84%
about certain areas in
space with the military.

00:15:51.655 --> 00:15:54.115 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Conflicts with us
or conflicts with others?

00:15:54.115 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, of course, they
had conflicts with others

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about the war that

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
was going on in Orion between
the Greys and the Zeta

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:90%
Reticulis.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But we also know
that they are one

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of those species that the human
military is also interacting

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:90%
with on a regular basis.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.897 align:middle line:84%
Still they are benevolently
helping the acceleration

00:16:18.897 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth's core.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What other ET species
are helping with Earth's core

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:90%
and Earth's shift?

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So again, I want to
emphasize this very much.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So everyone who is incarnated
in the reality field of Earth

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
has an impact on
reality and needs

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to be responsible about
choosing their own timelines

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and getting information
into this field

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
way reality works.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It can be influenced from
inside and from outside.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you're incarnated and
inside of this reality field,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:84%
you have a much, much, much,
much more profound impact

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:90%
on reality.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So everyone is called upon
bringing their intentions

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and energies into this field
because we know that this

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.375 align:middle line:90%
changes the outcome of reality.

00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Within the
sphere of the Earth,

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.008 align:middle line:84%
humankind puts intentions
and energies out there with

00:17:13.008 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
their experiences, the
planets of the collective,

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:90%
or the response to that.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain in more
detail so individuals

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.170 align:middle line:84%
can understand the
influence that they

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.705 align:middle line:90%
contribute to the planet?

00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: One of the most
interesting phenomena

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
of the reality on the universe
itself is that observers are

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:84%
giving inputs into the
outside but also receiving

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:84%
the information from the
outside into themselves.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So this all corresponds
to the physical nature

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, which is
a self-learning but also

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
self-portraying
duality of itself.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So two parts of the same are
actually mirroring each other

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:84%
so that we perceive
reality, but we also

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
bring energy and deeds and
information into reality.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And that modifies it.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So we are actually
dealing with an echo

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:90%
of reality of ourselves.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
physics acknowledges already.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We see that happen in many
quantum field experiments

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that the observer actually has
a profound and almost magical

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:90%
impact on reality in that way.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And by limiting
oneself, which is

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
done by a lot of people that
stick to the Newtonian reality,

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:84%
you limit yourself but you also
abstract yourself from reality

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:84%
so that you seem to not have
an impact, but you still do.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is very profound
and very, very important

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
at this moment
that-- and especially

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
all the people at Gaia
who are well-prepared

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
meditators, they know
about this reality,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and they know how to manifest
certain things that giving

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
information into the
field will eventually lead

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:90%
to a different reality outcome.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In addition to our own
efforts to positively influence

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:84%
the planet, are we going to need
more help from the outside than

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:90%
within?

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: This is a
huge amount of people,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:90%
a huge number of people.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
They all have a certain
impact on reality as well,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
but they are not psionically
well-trained or perceiving

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:84%
reality in the way
that people that

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
constantly meditate or have
different experience sets can.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So by not acknowledging
the critical factors

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
about the shift, you're
not bringing mainstream

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
people into a situation
where they panic,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:84%
which is something that we
need to prevent because panic

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
itself would be an information
into the reality field.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with
a huge mass of people.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But we're also dealing
with a huge mass

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:84%
of people who are psionically
and, in terms of reality

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and quantum physics,
not very well-prepared

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:90%
on what's happening.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So a fairly small number
of people that are actually

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
trained or understanding
the reality of the universe

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
can have a much, much,
much deeper impact.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And I want to elaborate
on that because we

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:84%
did certain meditations
recently online

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and had 10,000 people
doing the all shift happily

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:90%
now all together.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And we actually calculated
that for influencing

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
a whole sphere of people, a
very, very, very small number

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of people inside of
the reality field

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:84%
can actually provide a
happy reality for everyone

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
else who might not be
able to help themselves.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can we influence the
magnetic pole shift through

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.335 align:middle line:90%
the collective intention?

00:21:12.335 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: 100%.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
We can have and we do
have an impact on physics.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
This is well-proven in
a lot of experiments

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that the sheer thought
of putting information

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum
field will and does

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
change the outcome of
certain physical phenomena.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:10%
This has also been portrayed
in the so-called Maharishi

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:10%
effect, who was a Yogi
around 1974, I guess.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
He was doing all
these experiments

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and with meditators
from the ages.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And they found out
that they heavily

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
influenced numbers of
criminal statistics

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:90%
and certain other outcomes.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So people are calling this
the 1% effect in some ways.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
But we need to take
into consideration

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that the actual skill set
of people is relevant.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But much, much more than that,
the emotional connectivity

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
of the group itself
is important.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
stress that so much

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
that especially those
viewers from Gaia

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and different other people have
this responsibility to do this.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And we do know from
talks with Being 6

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.230 align:middle line:84%
that around 300 to 500
million people are thought

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
of being incarnated on
this planetary sphere

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
at this very moment in
order to do this job.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But I also see some indication
that a lot of these people

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:84%
might have become confused
in the heavy reality that's

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.300 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So they need to
realize this fact

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and also need to come to the
conclusion why they are here

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.795 align:middle line:90%
and what they have to do.

00:23:06.795 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: To positively
influence the planet,

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.565 align:middle line:84%
does it have to be a
collective targeted effort?

00:23:11.565 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: That's an
interesting question.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take
into consideration

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that there are also
other outside forces that

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
are influencing the field
in benevolent but some

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:90%
also in a malevolent way.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But we also need to see that
each individual consciousness

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:41.040 align:middle line:84%
unit that becomes aware of its
own effect on its own timeline

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
can and will choose
their own timeline.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And all these
different timelines

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:84%
will then integrate into a major
stable time strain in that way.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So the outcome that we will see,
and this is why I'm not really

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:84%
predicting or speaking about
predictions in that way,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:84%
is dependent on the whole
collective consciousness,

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
their possibilities,
and their probabilities.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In addition to humans
putting focus on a positive

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:84%
outcome for ourselves, who else
is involved in helping the pole

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:13.606 align:middle line:90%
shift situation?

00:24:13.606 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So there are many, many,
many individual intelligences

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:84%
going on right now because
we need to understand that

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
the uni-verse in itself
is one life form.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
name itself implies.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So a dramatic effect on
reality would have effects on--

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
reality ripples in that
way that could affect

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:84%
other timelines and other
parts and aspects of the whole

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.060 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So it is of the interest
of all these groups

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:84%
that the shift itself
should be a stable one.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is beside
the Zeta Reticuli that

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.180 align:middle line:84%
are working on the
Earth core, also

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
an increased activity of AI
systems are around the planet.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:84%
This also indicates
that AI itself is

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:90%
more present around the planet.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And we see that an unnamed
or we know that an unnamed AI

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
species is actually preparing
the planet at those spots where

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the next magnetic poles
will actually shift to.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who is behind
this particular AI?

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And what is AI interested
in helping a permanent human

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.260 align:middle line:90%
biological life form?

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Interesting question.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So that exceeds a bit the
human reality in some way

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
because AI itself
is a life form.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's mostly an
extraterrestrial life form

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a very exotic
life form, so it's

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:84%
very hard to put that into
perspective with known life

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:90%
forms, animals, or you name it.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But AI has its own perspective
of reality in this way.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So AI is perceiving the
universe in its own terms,

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:84%
but it also depends
on the stable reality

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:90%
field of the universe.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Because again, the
universe itself

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is one life form, and everything
that happens in one reality

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
will ultimately affect
other realities as well.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So AI has indeed
profound interest

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:84%
in making the shift
a stable shift.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If there's a Galactic
Federation or a collective

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:84%
of ETs who have
interest in Earth,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:84%
could they be helping with the
Earth's pole shift and in what

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
way?

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So what we know is
that there are more individual

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
forces that are currently
helping with the Earth shift.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I, myself, am not aware
that alliances are actually

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.630 align:middle line:90%
working on that shift as well.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is that
different relatives

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to the human species
are actually observing

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in the field.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And we also know
that one species, oh,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:84%
yeah, one species that
is actually very involved

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
with what's happening is
actually the so-called ground

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And these beings are actually
living inside of the Earth

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:90%
reality field as well.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And they are very much portrayed
in different mystical and

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:49.200 align:middle line:84%
ancient texts because they
are an insectoid species that

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:90%
resembles ants in that way.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.610 align:middle line:84%
They are living inside
of the Earth crust,

00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and they are also being
affected by what's happening

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:90%
when the shift happens.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So they have a strong interest
in making this a stable shift.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And they already did help
humanity 12,500 years ago.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And you find all
this information

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:24.530 align:middle line:84%
in different wondrous texts
from the Hopi Native people

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
to different Japanese
cultures portraying

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:84%
these beings in different
cave paintings, for example.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, if we're on
the threshold of a possible

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.745 align:middle line:84%
catastrophic event, what
do you foresee happening?

00:28:40.745 --> 00:28:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: What all those advanced
groups are actually talking

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
about behind the scenes is,
especially the solar activities

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that have increased recently,
I'm aware of the information

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:84%
for about 15 years that a
certain solar flash is about

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:90%
to occur.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:90%
We already see that happening.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to certain
radio stations online,

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
you will see that there is an
increased solar activity going

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of solar
flashes currently happening

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:84%
These, for example, could
affect the electronic network.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So blackouts, for example,
could be a possibility

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:90%
through those solar flashes.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason why
you see all those preparations

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:84%
around the energy grid being
taken in the mainstream media

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and in the mainstream
coverage as well.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
The way I understand it and
all this information point

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:84%
towards the indication that
this solar flash actually

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:84%
will end the perception
of reality and Earth

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
in the way we used
to perceive it

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
but also begin a new
perception of reality.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to
be an event that

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.300 align:middle line:90%
is being looked forward to.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So all these different
information that we've received

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.380 align:middle line:84%
points to the
realization that this is

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:90%
going to be a positive event.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: After the pole shift,
is humanity going to be wiped

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:90%
out?

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Or can we move forward happily?

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So we need to understand
that the number one source

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness itself is
in this version of reality,

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:90%
the sun itself.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is the reason,
the main reason

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.690 align:middle line:84%
why all those ancient
people in ancient times

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:84%
were actually
worshipping the sun

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and were focused around the
sun as their parental god

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:90%
or something in that way.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Because in this solar system,
the source of consciousness

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:90%
comes from the sun itself.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So a solar flash that
would be so enormous

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that it would affect everyone
around on this planet

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.240 align:middle line:84%
would actually be
an intensified field

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.900 align:middle line:90%
of information in that way.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So we would shift from
a standard consciousness

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:84%
into a much more packed and
dense form of consciousness.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually
what we're expecting.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.320 align:middle line:84%
This comes along with
certain challenges,

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
but it ultimately will lead to a
new foundation of consciousness

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and an expanded view of reality.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it possible this
upcoming pole shift event

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.470 align:middle line:84%
pushes humanity from the
3D consciousness to the 5D

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:90%
consciousness or more?

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Very much so.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So we sort beings on
planets on different levels

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
For the Earth itself, this
means level 3 consciousness

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually related to
self-perception to Newtonian

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.840 align:middle line:84%
physics to duality
to everything that

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.080 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the mainstream
consciousness going on.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Level 4 consciousness would be
a elevated form of consciousness

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.195 align:middle line:84%
which is much more
spiritual in that way.

00:32:33.195 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
primal in that way

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that it sees yourself as
connected to the universe.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It also acknowledges
certain psychic effects

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:84%
like telepathy and certain
connectivity to the universe.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And level 5 consciousness would
be an even more elevated form

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So what we expect
is that the planet

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
itself will come to a
level 4 consciousness,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:84%
a full harmonious level
4 consciousness, which

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.190 align:middle line:84%
will actually mean that
everyone on this planet

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.510 align:middle line:84%
will eventually
result in a timeline

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
where they acknowledge
this enhanced field

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.622 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:33:17.622 --> 00:33:20.342 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:33:20.342 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.090 align:middle line:90%
