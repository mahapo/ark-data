[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:16.470 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure".

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and I am here

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.877 align:middle line:84%
with our special
guest, Emery Smith.

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Emery, thank you for being here.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks, Dave.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: In our
previous episode,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:10%
we talked a little about
how military bases are

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
being built over
extraterrestrial bases

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:10%
or crashed craft.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And we had started to talk
a little bit about what you

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:90%
may know regarding Antarctica.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So, just to get more
specific with you, according

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to Pete Peterson,
operations in Antarctica

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:84%
have been ongoing
for quite some time.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
He was aware of it being
back to at least the 1950s.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it is a
truly vast operation that's

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:90%
being conducted down there.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So, could you speak
a little bit more

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.827 align:middle line:84%
about what you know of what's
going on in Antarctica?

00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I have
recently met with four

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
of the scientists that were
part of that expedition,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
many expeditions in the past few
years, in Costa Rica recently.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:10%
And what was interesting is
there's also another craft that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:10%
is part of some of the craft
that's down there in a cave

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:10%
down near Costa Rica, I'll say.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so this
group was asking

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
me to come with them to
Antarctica to check it out

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
on another expedition,
which I refrained

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to go because all
newbies don't return.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.756 align:middle line:90%
So, that's how dangerous it is.

00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And any people
that go down there

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:84%
to do documentaries or try to
get with people to take them

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
down there usually end up
pretty much not coming back.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So, right now, if you don't
have a specific, really

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
good classification, you're
not going down there.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So, that doesn't leave it
open to satellites, however,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and special drones
that we have access to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:90%
to find out more information.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Different organizations
are funding

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
this, private organizations,
because people want to know.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.502 align:middle line:84%
And so, this information
was given to me

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
strictly from the four
scientists that actually

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
came from working there for
two years, which they do have

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
the access to get back down
in there to do what they do,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.955 align:middle line:90%
which is basically--

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
well, I was talking about
mapping and measuring

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
of the melting ice
and how much time they

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
have before other
things are exposed,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
which lead to the exposure of
the underground city that's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
there that has been there for
a very long time, apparently.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you familiar
with there being any plan

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
to reveal ancient ruins
under the ice in Antarctica,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
but not spacecraft
at first or anything

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.182 align:middle line:84%
more modern, as part of a
gradual disclosure agenda?

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They
already started that.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So, they're saying
there's something

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.210 align:middle line:84%
down there, a big void, just
like they did in Egypt now.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a big void underneath
the pyramids there.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We have a very, very
large city that's there.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In Egypt.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.061 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: In Egypt
under the pyramids,

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:90%
about a mile high dome.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, very large.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the same thing
that's going on in Antarctica.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So, they're slowly saying wow,
through satellite imagery with

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:84%
special
ground-penetrating radar,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:90%
certain scientists from--

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
which have nothing to do
with trying to find bases,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
More like trying to find
oil reservoirs and gold--

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.896 align:middle line:84%
have stumbled upon
these giant voids.

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So, you're going to
start hearing about this.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.911 align:middle line:84%
These voids are
the ancient cities.

00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, these are the
ones that have been here

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
This is right up your
alley with all the stuff

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:90%
that you talk about.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
great camera footage

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:84%
taken from an
archaeologist that we know.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:90%
And we have seen this footage.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And it is compelling because
the camera they snake down under

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid to see this,
when it first was discovered,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.599 align:middle line:84%
which I cannot disclose,
was just fascinating.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So, the same thing is
going on in Antarctica now,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
is how are we going to
disclose this and clean up

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:90%
all the artifacts down there?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Which will really
mess up the story

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.676 align:middle line:84%
of how we got here,
kind of like Mars

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and the moon and
everything else.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's right here
on this planet.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: All of a
sudden in the media,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:10%
we hear this report that
neutrinos were used to discover

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:10%
a very large new chamber in the
Great Pyramid above the Grand

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.522 align:middle line:10%
Gallery, which is the big
hallway with the tall--

00:04:46.522 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:10%
and they're kind
of saying it might

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:10%
be on a diagonal with
the Grand Gallery,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:10%
but it's a little higher.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.899 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very large,
previously undisclosed space.

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I've heard about that.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.401 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Now, with the
technology you're reporting,

00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:10%
it would appear that
they would have known

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.436 align:middle line:10%
about this for a long time.

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, they've known
about it for a very long time.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Have people been into
that room that you know of?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
alliance needs to decide,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
is what do we release and
how slow do we release it?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a
gradual scientific--

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
huge, worldwide,
scientific investigation

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
of these tablets or
this or that or whatnot,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
match what's going on

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:90%
or what we've been taught here.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
the hard thing for people

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to grasp because of the belief
systems that we all have.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think
that there might be a way?

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't want to
tear up the pyramid, right?

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They're very concerned about
antiquities preservation.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But now we're talking about
a massive, massive chamber

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
inside the pyramid openly
discussed in mainstream media.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So, is there a way
into that room already?

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Do we know what's in that room?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm 80% sure they've
already been in that room

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom up.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.050 align:middle line:84%
There are tunnels that
they have already dug

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
under into this city,
so it's already been--

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
they're learning what happened.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
trying to learn

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the texts, learn
all the symbols,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:90%
and what's it all mean?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's a huge undertaking
on the private side of whoever

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.309 align:middle line:90%
is running that contract job.

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that much.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Just for the sake
of people's curiosity, what

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
might be some of the
most surprising things

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:90%
that we would learn?

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, what would we
actually see if we ever

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.916 align:middle line:84%
get to see the
footage of this room?

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
most surprising thing

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:90%
we would discover?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.036 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
you're going to see

00:06:45.036 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of literature and tablets,
and also artifacts that are not

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
from on Earth; not
of-Earth-origin technology,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
which most of it
has been removed.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Whether they want to say it
was found with the site or not,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
it will be a
spectacle because it

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
has to do with someone
already being there trying

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to do the same thing we
were doing about a higher,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization, and
they left some things behind.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So, there's special
scientists in the world who

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
grab these devices,
and they can figure out

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:90%
what the devices were used for.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what their job is to do.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
interesting people,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:90%
and they're responsible.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
They're the unseen
heroes you hear about.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
information that they

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:84%
get is usually used to give
to these private corporations,

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's to be used for bad,
and because it's so amazing,

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
why give it to us to help us
cure cancer or be able to talk

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:90%
to anyone in the universe?

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.598 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: I want to bring
something up with you that I

00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:10%
think is directly relevant, and
that is an insider that Pete

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:10%
Peterson has hoped to
get me in touch with--

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:10%
it hasn't actually
happened yet--

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:10%
but this person was
involved in the excavation

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:10%
of a strange sort of
metallic alloy sarcophagus

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:10%
from the same Giza Plateau area.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And I believe he said
it was underground.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And they removed the
sarcophagus, and they had it--

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to figure
out how to get it open,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't
open it with tools.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:10%
And apparently on the ship--

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:10%
they were transporting it on a
US military ship of some kind--

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:10%
someone telepathically
interfaced

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.085 align:middle line:10%
with this sarcophagus, and they
could read the inscriptions.

00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Even though originally it
was a different language,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:90%
they could read the language.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.849 align:middle line:84%
And then they had to sing
a certain note or phrase--

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember which it was--

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Harmonic, yeah.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And you put your hands out
like this and it opened.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And then what they found
inside were these various kind

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:90%
of hand-held tools.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
tools, apparently,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
would give you holographic
reconstructions

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
of historical
events that happened

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
during the time of the
people that had this thing.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And that
sarcophagus alone

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:90%
is just of inestimable value.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
any stories like that?

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I have heard
of very similar stories

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
of these sarcophagi and
coffins and tubes that

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
are made of some unknown
metal but they're seamless.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And they can only be
opened, as far as I knew,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:84%
by lineage, actually,
and harmonic.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So, that's interesting you
said that, because it actually

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
helps me understand some
things now put together

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:90%
that I've been debriefed on.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen some of
these vats, actually.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What about
this idea of an object

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that you might be able
to hold in your hand,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and then you can kind of
talk to it with your mind

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.257 align:middle line:84%
and it will show
you, like, a library?

00:09:41.257 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a consciousness-assisted
technology

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
that you have to hold and
use your consciousness.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
to think about it,

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and then whatever, however it
operates; however the operator

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:90%
knows how to operate it.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Or usually it just
automatically will turn on.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
having an iPhone

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:90%
without a passcode on it.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.749 align:middle line:90%
Automatically anyone can use it.

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But some of these devices;
these consciousness-assisted

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
technologies, are all
lineage-related or

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
frequency-related,
so that you have

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to be of the right
ancient lineage

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.010 align:middle line:84%
to hold that one little
frequency for this thing

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: A genetic marker
in your DNA, do you think?

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
When we had Pete
Peterson here last time,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:84%
he gave us some extremely
fascinating information

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
about very, very
long; many, many miles

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:84%
long, perfectly carved
tunnels in South America.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.165 align:middle line:84%
Like, underneath
the Nazca Lines.

00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And he talked
about what appeared

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to have been a vast
extraterrestrial city down

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with our show
on Gaia, "Unearthing Nazca",

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Pete is claiming that the
bodies we had on that show

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:90%
were from this city.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.531 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm curious if you've heard
about those tunnels in Meso-

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and South America, and
any information you

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:90%
might have on that.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
My scientist sources also
have invited me down there

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
to analyze the tunnels, which
have a lot of craft in them;

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:84%
which the tunnels actually have
beings frozen in time sticking

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
out of the walls
of these things.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Have you ever heard
the term "stasis beings"?

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't personally
believe these beings

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
that come from Gaia
are from that site.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:90%
But that's my own opinion.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And I have not been asked
to analyze these beings yet.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So, you're saying
that there are--

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:90%
this is totally amazing, Emery.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
be honest with you.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is that I
got another briefing from Pete.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I haven't said a word
about it to anyone.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do it for the
first time right now, OK?

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:10%
And the briefing was
that, because Gaia

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:10%
did "Unearthing Nazca",
the show, that our alliance

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:10%
people have gotten a lot more
interested in that area again,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:10%
and that apparently the
Mexican government-- we have

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:10%
different governments in
Meso- and South America

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:10%
apparently involved in this.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And, apparently,
very recently we

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:84%
took custody of these
five different craft,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and he said they are
so advanced that we've

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.920 align:middle line:90%
got whole teams of people.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
He estimated 2,000, 3,000 people
are working on these craft now.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.682 align:middle line:10%
But it's so advanced we have
no idea how to get into it

00:12:27.682 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:10%
or what the heck is going on.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm curious about
your thoughts on that.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.374 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:12:32.374 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you say we, who
are you referring to who

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
took over the five craft?

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I guess it would be--

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.996 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The alliance or...?

00:12:38.996 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: DIA military
industrial complex,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
what we would call MIC
secret space program folk.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: OK.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:90%
That I can confirm 100%.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:84%
They are now in control of all
the tunnels and all the ships

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and all the bodies and
all the technology,

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
which has recently
just happened.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's now very
difficult to get in there.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still
deciding whether to go

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
or not because it's just a
matter of if they invite me

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
again to go down there
and decipher some

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of the ships and craft and
some of the extraterrestrials

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that they found, and of
course, the technology.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there is a large amount
of these beings and the craft

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Can you confirm
anything about Pete's testimony

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
regarding that the craft
are so advanced that we

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what
to do with them yet?

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I can absolutely concur with
that, because the group would

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
never have called
me to go down there

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and check this out, number
one, because if they knew how

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.866 align:middle line:84%
to do it-- and they're
scientists and knew how

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.282 align:middle line:84%
to do it, they
wouldn't be calling

00:13:46.282 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
me to ask me to come on
board clandestinely, which

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I can talk about freely.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly
what happened.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't seen
his show, by the way,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:90%
so I didn't know any of this.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, let's
talk a little bit

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.154 align:middle line:84%
about what we did on "Unearthing
Nazca," because I didn't even

00:14:06.154 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:84%
know you knew
anything about this.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:10%
We've had x-rays
taken of these bodies,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:10%
and it does not in any way even
possibly appear to be a hoax.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:10%
The genetic testing shows
that it's over 1,500 years

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:10%
old or more in some cases.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be genuine genetic
tissue that's been preserved

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:90%
in diatomaceous earth.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:84%
They have three fingers and
three toes instead of five,

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:90%
like we do.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It definitely looks like
this is an authentic specimen

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious
about your thoughts.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen
"Unearthing Nazca"?

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I've seen just the
small briefing that came out

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
with those two mummies,
and just the briefing that

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
came out over the
world and through Gaia.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I read.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my first
question as a scientist

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:90%
is, who tested it?

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Where was it tested?

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:90%
How did you retrieve it?

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
How did you get it
over the border?

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if I test it
at multiple facilities

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
of my choice, which you
are not allowed to know?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And all these questions, because
it's a very interesting story.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying yes or no,
because I don't know because I

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:90%
was not part of that project.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:90%
So I can't judge it.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Since you say these things--

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course, I'm
very close with you.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:90%
I believe you.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But as a scientist, I also have
to ask many other questions

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.321 align:middle line:84%
and actually have to examine the
bodies because I don't believe

00:15:37.321 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
there's too many other people
out there coming forward

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
like myself that would probably
go do that and give an expert

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:90%
opinion and write something up.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.797 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm right
now being published

00:15:47.797 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
in Stanford University
for the Atacama being

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.046 align:middle line:84%
coming forward with that
with Dr. Garry Nolan.

00:15:52.046 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So, you'll see that white
paper with my name on it,

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
which gives kind of me some
credit about my background.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I
can't answer that.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Just by looking
at some pictures,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't say yes or no without
being part of the project

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and getting my own
opinion of what they are

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and where they came from, and
also the type of DNA it is.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:90%
What was the DNA percentages?

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.690 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: There apparently is
a DNA test being conducted

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:10%
in Russia right now with
some of the finest DNA

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.979 align:middle line:10%
testing they have.

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
The results have
not yet come in yet.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It apparently takes a long time.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:10%
But we did have
Peruvian scientists who

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:10%
did a lot of work down there.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:10%
We also have M.K. Jesse, who
is a radiologist right here

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:10%
in Boulder, who has
surveyed the x-rays

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.030 align:middle line:10%
and has said that this
definitely appears

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:10%
to be a biological being.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.547 align:middle line:10%
It does not appear to be
anything conventional human.

00:16:44.547 --> 00:16:45.347 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:16:45.347 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And the carbon dating
or whatever they

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:90%
use to measure the dating.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Carbon dating
has been confirmed.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:10%
It's all early
AD; very early AD.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Interesting.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, would
you be interested?

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not able to
ask you this on behalf--

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I would--

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would you be
interested in doing

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:90%
that if you were invited?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.081 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I would
entertain that, of course.

00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I would be
helpful in any way

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I can to help approve or
disapprove these beings.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: And you told me before
that apparently the Atacama

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.889 align:middle line:10%
humanoid that you had in
"Sirius" is not the only one.

00:17:16.889 --> 00:17:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us a
little more about that?

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I can.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
There is another being
down in that location

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
that has been discovered that
is very similar to this being.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are now trying
to work something out

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:90%
so we could get this being.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
If we can get this being, we
can get the DNA from both beings

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and see if they match and see if
it is a new subspecies or not.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But the data that we're
printing right now at Stanford--

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to spill it
because I can't talk about it--

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.782 align:middle line:84%
is going to talk about
that exact thing.

00:17:55.782 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So, you guys are going to have
to wait for that white paper

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to come out in a
couple of weeks.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.489 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll go from there.

00:18:01.489 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very interested
in that being, too.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to immediately grab this
being, put it in a safe place,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and be able to run
multiple tests on it

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens
and go from there.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just speculation
right now, so we

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
can't say anything
until we actually

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:90%
have the DNA in our hands.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
As you know, as I went over to
Barcelona with Greer and Dr.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Bravo to obtain the first
one and bring back that DNA

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to Stanford for Dr. Gary Nolan
to test, one of the world's

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:90%
leading geneticists.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a lot to do,
because you have to have,

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the future
multiple testing sites,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and larger teams
involved in organizations

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
so it's just not one
foundation doing all the work.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And it should be a
joint collective thing.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Most projects like this
should be collective and not

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:90%
just one overseer of that.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it's harder
to manipulate things

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:84%
when there's multiple
people involved

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:90%
instead of one overseer.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: One of
the things that you

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:10%
carry with you is something that
hardly anyone has ever seen.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.180 align:middle line:10%
You seem to always
have it with you.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The only other time
this was ever shown

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.676 align:middle line:84%
was on stage at
Contact in the Desert.

00:19:18.676 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
You handed it to me when
I was doing a panel.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a sensation
for the audience.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So, could you hold up
what it is that you have

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.375 align:middle line:90%
and tell us about this?

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:32.159 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, this--after the
team and I went over there

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to Barcelona-- this is
the Ata being from Chile,

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:90%
from the Atacama Desert.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And what we did was
we wanted to make sure

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that we not only have
the DNA, but let's

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:90%
run every possible test.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's get CAT
scans, MRIs, x-rays,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.762 align:middle line:84%
as much as we can for
the scientific community

00:19:58.762 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
to look at this because the
private organization that

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
has it, who's been very
generous and needs lots of help,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
would like to do more
testing and do more things.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was able, by working
on some other secret projects

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:90%
at the time...

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:84%
we can 3D render
organs and things.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:84%
We can also 3D render
pretty much any CAT

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
scan into any material.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:25.749 align:middle line:84%
So we can shoot your
brain, CAT scan your brain,

00:20:25.749 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and I can enter it
into the computer,

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and I can print your brain
out in any material I want.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.255 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:20:31.255 --> 00:20:32.296 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Isn't that cool?

00:20:32.296 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So, that way, before
I operate on you,

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I can make sure where all
your blood vessels are,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and I can actually do-- yeah.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So, I can say that now
because it's already out;

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:90%
it's been disclosed.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So, I thought, hey, why don't
I take a CAT scan of this being

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and put it into the computer
and make an exact replica

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
duplicate, cell-by-cell, into
this just polycarbonate I

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
used because it was already too
expensive to do anything else?

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is, we printed
it and this is what came out,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:90%
this polycarbonate exact being.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, one of the things
that I notice right away,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
which people probably notice
is that, like, the head is

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:11.771 align:middle line:90%
kind of sliced off.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
When we made the
program, we made sure

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that part was open so people
could see inside and see

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:84%
the brain lobes, and you know,
there was different things.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.532 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could print
just with the chest open

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
so you can see some of the
lungs and different things

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:90%
that were in there.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But just to have
something that was durable

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
last a long time,

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and something that you could
see the volume of-- of course,

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
the skull was the
most amazing thing.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Three times the
size of our skull.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
From chin to top,
that'd be like,

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:84%
it's the same length as his
torso from the sternal notch

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.220 align:middle line:90%
to the umbilicus.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
We call the belly
button, umbilicus.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's three
times the same size as that.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
That would be like your head,
one, two, three, three times

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:90%
your own size.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:90%
So, very interesting.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
The story on this being, if
you want me to go into, is--

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
which I was not part of the
collection site or anything

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:90%
like that in the early years.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But I did read a briefing
that matches that of where

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:90%
this craft has crashed.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was shot
down some time ago.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the exact time.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was an egg-shaped craft,
about the size of a Volkswagen

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.582 align:middle line:90%
van.

00:22:27.582 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The size of the egg.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, the
size of the egg.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.390 align:middle line:90%
There were five occupants.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And when the army got
there, the military--

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:90%
not ours, but theirs--

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
got there, two of them were
already dead, the adults.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:90%
They were 22 inches high.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
three trying to get away.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And they shot one, and two
they lost into the jungle,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
or into the desert or whatever,
which the story goes they did

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:90%
wind up in a village.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And the villagers apparently
saw these little beings,

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and they clubbed them and
wrapped them in cloth,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:90%
in red cloth and went to--

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why would
they club them?

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.432 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I'm
going to tell you.

00:23:17.432 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you why
I think they did.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Because after they
wrapped it in red cloth,

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
they took it to the front
of the church doorsteps,

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and they wrote "El Diablo,"
and they laid it there.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The devil.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, the devil.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:90%
So, how unfortunate.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, you
know, the skull.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.745 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that I always

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
wondered about is there's
this crack in the plate.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Like there's these two plates,
and this part here on the left

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
looks like it
sticks up in ridges

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:90%
over the part on the right.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So, that's not the
regular physiology.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
This is because its
head was crushed?

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, it did have
that kind of a point

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
there after we looked at that
in different computer programs.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:59.197 align:middle line:84%
But it is offset because
of the smashed skull.

00:23:59.197 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And the hole in the back
of the head, so you know,

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
also was something that
was done prior to myself

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and the team actually
doing the autopsy.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I did use that hole,
though, that was

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:84%
made by another scientist
before me many years ago,

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to gather the brain material,
some of the brain matter,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and of course, some of
the layers of the brain

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and some of the bone
marrow, of course,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:90%
was what we're really after.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So, we took some of
that from the rib cage

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.980 align:middle line:84%
and also from the humerus
of the arm of the being.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:90%
So, we had a lot of samples.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:90%
We had a lot of good samples.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:90%
And we took those samples back.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now it is
very interesting,

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
something that I wish we could
have gotten into "Sirius".

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to see us
go into the fact

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:10%
that there is a case in
Russia of a little being

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:10%
called Alyoshenka.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:10%
And this being does have the
22-inch height that you're

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:10%
saying is like the adults.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But the dried body of it
is basically identical.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
It is essentially identical
to what this looks like.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And the story there was
that the being somehow

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:84%
was found by a woman
who had mental illness.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And she was feeding it
candy and milk for a while,

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:90%
but it was dying.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And she tried to bring it
to the hospital in Russia,

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and after it was brought
to the hospital it died.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:84%
When its body dried out,
it dried out the same way

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:90%
that this Atacama being did.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And then,
unfortunately, the story

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.374 align:middle line:84%
goes that the
Japanese were going

00:25:39.374 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
to buy it for a very large
sum of money to study it,

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and then it
mysteriously disappears.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So, what do you
think Alyoshenka is?

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to tell.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.571 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I don't
know the story.

00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I know a little bit
about the story.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.903 align:middle line:84%
I did read a little bit
about that briefing.

00:25:53.903 --> 00:25:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And then like with anything,
even with this being,

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
this is not something

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that I saw actually
inside where I was at.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:84%
This was after I got out that
I was able to handle this.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just associated
this briefing

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
with this accident at this exact
place, so to make that clear.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, things can be
made inside for disinformation

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:90%
campaigns as well.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And beings can be
grown and these crashes

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
can be made to
disinform scientists

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
around the world that are
not part of the projects.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And some that
leave the projects,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:90%
they want them disinformed.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.084 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to be very delicate
about talking about DNAs

00:26:38.084 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and beings, and where they
come from and the stories

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.540 align:middle line:84%
behind them because there's
very few people out there that

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
actually know from
start to finish,

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.727 align:middle line:84%
all right, this went to
this to this to this.

00:26:48.727 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm being a
private investigator saying,

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:84%
well, this is what I read,
this is what happened.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Then later on we finally got it.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.118 align:middle line:84%
And then we did this and
it matches everything.

00:26:56.118 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
There's another one, matches
the same exact report.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, all these
different things.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:90%
So, that I would not--

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I would just say I
think it's a similar--

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.646 align:middle line:84%
I think it's part of the
same phenotype species.

00:27:06.646 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Without looking at the DNA
and actually matching the two,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:84%
which would be the
most amazing thing.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.130 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it went missing
100%, obviously red flag.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Red flag, red flag.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Any time anything goes missing
or someone gets hurt or killed,

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:90%
it's a red flag.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.336 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think
there's any relationship

00:27:22.336 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
between this story of
the church with the being

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and paper labeled "El
Diablo" and the corpse that

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:84%
ended up in the movie
"Sirius", or are those two

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.097 align:middle line:90%
separate things?

00:27:35.097 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You're
talking about the Ata?

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:90%
The Ata.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:90%
No, that's the Ata.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, that is?

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That is the Ata.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, did the church
hold onto it all that time?

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The church
held onto it--

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.868 align:middle line:84%
the priest held onto
it many, many years.

00:27:44.868 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:90%
He knew it was very important.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he made a
deal with someone.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I know the US government already
had samples of this somehow.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So, in the exchange
somewhere, there

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
was this civilian person, the
priest, who had access to it.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And then a private
organization went down there

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and purchased the
being from him, and now

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.372 align:middle line:84%
to an underground facility
near Barcelona being studied.

00:28:07.372 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And many new papers
are coming out.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I know they're
printing so much stuff.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
My own opinion, I think they
got a little bit infiltrated

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and maybe paid off
because of some

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:84%
of the things that are being
said now over from their people

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:90%
But like I said, we don't know.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
It's all speculation
because anything

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.930 align:middle line:90%
can be made to be disinformed.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: "Sirius" itself
kind of ends on a down,

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
to Theodore Lockman;

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:90%
we're talking to Garry Nolan.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
The whole movie establishes that
this is a credible non-human,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:90%
normal human, at least, thing.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
it kind of seems

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
like the film says,
"Oh, well, it's

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:90%
not really that big of a deal".

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's
very strange, yeah.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
The biggest story in
the world and no one

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:90%
wants to hear about it.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, I would say, hm.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say about that.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.350 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So, another thing
that I find fascinating is

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.640 align:middle line:10%
"Ripley's Believe It or Not"
in, I don't know, 1940s, ,

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:10%
1950s somewhere thereabouts,
had this thing called "AttaBoy".

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:10%
And it's just like the
Atacama humanoid, same size.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
The only real difference is
that the head is a little more

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:84%
bulbous in this way as opposed
to the way the other one looks.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I saw that one.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's so similar
in many other ways.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
from the same species

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:90%
or a similar species?

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I don't
believe so, no.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.510 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's too
many differences.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I did look at that
at one time closely.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So, I don't believe it's
from the same lineage

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.529 align:middle line:90%
or phenotype at all.

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But do you
think it might possibly

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
be extraterrestrial
also in its own way?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Without actually
bringing the proper test,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't speculate.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be fair.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, another
thing was these edifices

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that the people on Easter
Island wore on a necklace.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the necklace, when

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.630 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
body of this thing,

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it looks exactly like what
you autopsied in "Sirius".

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is that the face is

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:90%
kind of a stylized human face.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It's got these
large, round eyes,

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:90%
large kind of nose and mouth.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So, it is kind of an exaggerated
human face with large eyes.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:90%
That part looks wrong.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But the body is
absolutely dead-on.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And those Easter
Island people are

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.897 align:middle line:84%
saying that these were the
givers of wisdom and knowledge.

00:30:27.897 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think
there's a connection.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I do think there is a
connection with that.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I don't know
enough about their history.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I just know, from learning
from you about that story

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and seeing some of these
pictures a while back,

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:84%
that there is correlation,
for the body, that is.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:10%
And whether the
bodies are replicas

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:10%
or they're the actual
bodies that were mummified,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.600 align:middle line:10%
you know, swelling happens
during mummification sometimes,

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.170 align:middle line:10%
depending on where it's buried
and what it's buried in.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And things can change and
misform different body parts,

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
skeleton, into different--

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:84%
just like fossils, you know,
if they're in certain minerals,

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:84%
when they form
over time, they'll

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.460 align:middle line:84%
take on a different
color and shape.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a very interesting
thing when you look at mummies

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and how they're buried;
where they're buried;

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
the temperature; the
humidity; and then

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.110 align:middle line:84%
all these other factors
that fall into place.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happens with these beings.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So, I can see why you're asking
these questions, because they

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:90%
are similar in many ways.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.132 align:middle line:84%
But they're also--
there's differences,

00:31:28.132 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and, without actually having
all three of them right there,

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:90%
for me to say.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But I do agree with you that
the bodies are very similar.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.253 align:middle line:90%
Well, I want to thank you.

00:31:38.253 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:84%
This has been very fascinating
and we will have more in store.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Excellent.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:90%
So, thanks for being here.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Thanks for having me.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And thank
you for watching.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:90%
This is "Cosmic Disclosure".

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
