>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.970 align:middle line:10%
we're with former US
Marine, Mike Herrera.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
distinguished service record.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:10%
Today we discuss his
face-to-face encounter

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:10%
with a UAP run by a
secret unit of operatives.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE HERRERA:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate you having me on.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Give us a little brief
description about yourself.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I'm an
entrepreneur these days.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I do stuff with
private-security contracting.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a partner with a
major heavy-equipment company.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.213 align:middle line:84%
So that's been my
focus these days until,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
obviously, the recent events
that I've published out

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
in Washington DC with the
Press Club, among other shows,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:90%
podcasts I've been on.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about your
history with the Marines?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I wanted to
be a fighter pilot originally.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But my eyesight
wasn't that good.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So infantry was the next bet,
and become an infantry Marine,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and learned a lot, a lot of
great men I've served with,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was good to be a part
of history in a lot of ways.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And being a Marine has
definitely shaped me

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:90%
into the person I became today.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what is your
experience with the UAP

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.947 align:middle line:90%
and the Black Operatives team?

00:01:17.947 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Getting
held up at gunpoint

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:84%
with them-- we came
across something that they

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:90%
were doing illegal.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I had some theories,
at least coming forward

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and April, May, June time frame.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Earlier this year,
I had hypothesized

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
that they were doing drugs
or running drug operations

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
intercepted, these guys--

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:84%
they had tactics
that were basically

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
what you would resemble from
US Special Operations, very

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
organized, very
structuralized on their part.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:84%
The way that they were moving
was very rehearsed, very

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:90%
well done.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
told me that this was not

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.503 align:middle line:90%
their first rodeo, so to speak.

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And where did
this take place, Mike?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: This was in
Indonesia, Padang City,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
on the outskirts
of the city, when

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
we were doing humanitarian
relief to these people that

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
got hit by this tsunami
and earthquake that

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.708 align:middle line:84%
happened in 2009 on the
Western part of Sumatra.

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what was
your position there?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Why were you there?

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:90%
What was your duty there?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.377 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: We were there
as a security element

00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:14.555 align:middle line:84%
because Indonesia's the
second-largest terrorist

00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
capital in the world.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So they do a
lot of training there.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:90%
They've got a lot of rebels.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.535 align:middle line:84%
They've got a lot
of forces there

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:23.242 align:middle line:84%
that don't do anything good
to anybody in the area.

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So when there's a
natural disaster,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
they like to try to murder
people, kidnap, harass.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Every worst-case scenario
you can think of,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:90%
that's what they do.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Rarely.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm very familiar
with that, being

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.507 align:middle line:90%
over there many, many times.

00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I used to live over there.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So you kept referring to
these people as "they."

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.015 align:middle line:90%
Who is they?

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: This Black team.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So this Black team,
essentially, has been in--

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I should say, woven into
everything, including

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
government military, everything
that you can think of.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:10%
they've been woven in since
1947, when the National

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:10%
Security Act was signed by
the president at the time.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Their specific role was dealing
with the UFO crash retrievals,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
all those kinds of
programs to be more kept

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
secret, as opposed to the
government and the war machine,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
if you will, was focused on
the conventional warfare,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
conventional aircraft,
munitions, you name it.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So this was an organization
that was created out

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of
being top secret.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now Mike,
did at that time,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
when the weapons were pulled
on you, who they were?

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:90%
I had no clue.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.913 align:middle line:90%
I've had theories on that.

00:03:20.913 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
The thing that gave
it away was the fact

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that they had American
dialects and had American gear.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.017 align:middle line:84%
It was the same kind of
gear that we had, but newer.

00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:10%
It was Black OTV vests or IOTVs.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:90%
They had M-4s.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:90%
They had the quad-rail system.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
They had the pick-6 team, which
is the IR illumination devices

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%
for nighttime operations.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:84%
They had ACOGs, which we had the
RCOs, which were a step below.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.265 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Explain to the
audience what IOTV is and ACOG.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:90%
We know what that is, but--

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: ACOG is an Advanced
Combat Optical Gunsight.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's scope that has
a 4 by 32 magnification.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And then IOTV is just a
simple ballistics vest

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.507 align:middle line:90%
with SAPI plates put into it.

00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:90%
But they have black.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.952 align:middle line:84%
They had no markings
on anything, no--

00:03:55.952 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: The best equipment.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Pretty much.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Better than yours?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Oh, yeah.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.838 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how many
were in your team?

00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I had six
total, including me.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why were they
pulling guns on you?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
What were they
threatening you with?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.975 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Threatening us to be
killed because what we stumbled

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:84%
across was something
that was not supposed

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:90%
to be witnessed by anybody.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.497 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And what was that?

00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:19.768 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So come to find out,
because like I said earlier,

00:04:19.768 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
because the containers
that they had,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.643 align:middle line:84%
that these trucks were pulling
onto this platform, which

00:04:23.643 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
was below the craft, they had
these-- looked like shipping

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:90%
containers that were black.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:90%
They had a cylinder on the top.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And I had-- when
I came out to DC

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.823 align:middle line:84%
and briefed the Pentagon,
at least their office,

00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
as well as Senate
Intelligence Committee

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and the Special
Intelligence Service,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I would suspect that it was
drugs because the fact that can

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:90%
be vacuum sealed, oxygenated.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
From getting information
from these insiders

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
in this organization, they had
told me that it was humans.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just any humans.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
These are humans that are
screened for certain projects

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that they actually have,
that they develop things,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:90%
manufacture.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So they need these people
in order to do that.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: These people meaning--

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:84%
these are trained humans
that they're shipping?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Or are these another
type of life form?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So these are
actual humans that have

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
what they call psionic
abilities, which

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:90%
is borderline psychic.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
They have an elevated
state of consciousness.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
They pull these people
from third-world countries,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
one because it's from war-torn
areas or is from less desirable

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:90%
places that--

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They won't be missed.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, and they're
not taken against their will.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They're given the
opportunity to do this.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
But because of the lifestyle
that they're given,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
clean facilities,
clean water, good food,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
all this kind of stuff that
they would give people that

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
participate in these programs--
so going from that environment

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
back to where they're
from, most people

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
stay and choose to
do this, especially

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
with the severities of what
they're dealing with in turn.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mike, are any of the
extraterrestrials behind this

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%
agenda?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, as
a matter of fact,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
there is, because what they
call the P3s or the psionics,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that developed a
relationship with these ETs,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:90%
yes, that's a part of it.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.258 align:middle line:90%
So they know what's going on.

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're going to
sit here and land on the White

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:84%
House front lawn and say,
yes, the existence is here.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
There's proof of its
existence all over the world.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me a little
bit more about this "craft"

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So this craft
was an octagonal shape.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
It had eight, obviously,
sections on the edge of it.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It had octagonal patterns
on the actual craft, itself.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It looked like
scales, if you will.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was hovering about
15, 20 feet off the ground

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
from this platform.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was rotating
in a clockwise motion.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
It was transitioning colors
between a light-matte

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:90%
gray to a dark-matte black.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
It had these slits in
it or looked like--

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:90%
it might have been panels.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was the darkest
black color I've ever seen,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
so black that
light was basically

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.587 align:middle line:90%
being absorbed into it.

00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: How large?

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
What's the dimensions
of this craft?

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I estimated 300
feet because the helicopters

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:10%
that we flew in on, which
were CH-53 Super Stallions,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:10%
they're pretty
massive helicopters.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:10%
Those are about--

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Very large.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: --a hundred feet
in length from nose to tail.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.058 align:middle line:84%
So if you could fit three of
these underneath this craft,

00:07:07.058 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that's how I could tell
distance with that.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Especially being
a Marine, you get

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
to judge distance
very accurately

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
because of the training
that we go through,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:84%
as well as you do this day
in and day out, weapons

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
systems that have the mil
dots and everything on it,

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
teaches you how to
estimate ranges very well.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you notice
anything other than the size

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:90%
of the craft?

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Could: you see inside the craft?

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No?

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was there any entrance
points or exit points you seen

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.638 align:middle line:90%
people conjuring around?

00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, just
going underneath of it.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Going
underneath of it?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah, this platform--

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
come to find out, because
after we saw this happen--

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:90%
was a part of that craft.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was two different pieces.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure, all right.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.982 align:middle line:90%
So was the craft levitating?

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes, it was.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It was 15,
20 feet off the ground.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now whose craft do
you believe this is, Mike?

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: At that
time, obviously,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
with the human involvement--

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: At that time, yeah.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: The
human involvement, I

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
knew it was made
because there wouldn't

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.818 align:middle line:84%
be an ET element with a
human, especially armed people

00:08:02.818 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:84%
like that, especially if they
were running drugs at the time.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:90%
At least that's what I thought.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.535 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't think it
was an actual ET craft.

00:08:09.535 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
made because you

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:90%
could tell it was manufactured.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It had paneling on it
and everything like that.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You see
rivets or something?

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Mm-hmm,
seams, stuff like that.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And the tone that it emitted
was like a transformer

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
If you unplugged a guitar amp,
that's what it reminded me of.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing-- it's
not the exact frequency of that.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.737 align:middle line:90%
But it's very close to that.

00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That hum,
that kind of hum.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Oh, yeah.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: A little bit
of harmonics there--

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: A little
deep tone, huh?

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how close were
you able to actually get

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:90%
to the craft?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE HERRERA:
About a hundred--

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were you
able touch it or--

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.898 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No we were
about 150 feet away

00:08:38.898 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
before we were
intercepted by this team.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And they were just
kind of guarding it, you think?

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:43.969 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: All right.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They have a
perimeter set, obviously.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:84%
They know what they're doing,
keeping this under wraps.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we had eight
guys, at least,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:90%
that we dealt with directly.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And we did a tactical column
down this ridge, if you will.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had four on this
side, four on this side.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.728 align:middle line:84%
And they had what was
called a nosebleed.

00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
That's at least--
some SF operators

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I talked to, that's an
ambush point that they do.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.875 align:middle line:84%
So they have interlocking
fields of fire.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you have four
people on one side,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
they can interlock
like this, meaning

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that they can have twice as
many muzzles on one person,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and still effectively take
down whatever group they're

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
against at a very, very
fast pace, if you will.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mike, do you believe
this craft was man made

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:90%
or reverse engineered?

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Man made is
reverse engineered, at least

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:90%
my understanding of it.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It obviously derived from
something at that time.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
didn't think that--

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.973 align:middle line:84%
I saw movies with ETs
or aliens in them.

00:09:38.973 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK,
that's a cool concept.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.432 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't actually
believe in that stuff

00:09:42.432 --> 00:09:43.992 align:middle line:90%
until I came across this.

00:09:43.992 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Now I know we have some
brilliant minds in the world,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.408 align:middle line:90%
scientists, things like that.

00:09:47.408 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But this thing was way
more advanced than anything

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And I know aircraft very well.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:90%
That was what I wanted to do.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And seeing this thing
operate and take off

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
was not conventional
by any means.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was there any other
aircraft besides your aircraft

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:90%
there, at the site?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No?

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'd estimate we were
probably about 600 meters away

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
from our original LZ
that we landed at.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.832 align:middle line:84%
And we pushed 300 meters
up to this ridge line.

00:10:10.832 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we turned
around and saw this going--

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
looking down the slope.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this
craft sitting there.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You said you saw
the craft take off or move.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me, how
fast did it take off?

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.192 align:middle line:90%
And did you hear anything?

00:10:22.192 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: The craft
is sitting about 15,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
20 feet off the ground
from this platform.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So after they got the
last truck onto that--

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:90%
which I only saw four trucks.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
how many they had--

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
this platform rose
up off the ground.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the craft lowered
itself to meet this

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and get into one solid piece.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Then it rose slightly
above the tree line.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it completely
shot off left,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
which is where the ocean
is, on our direct left.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was a black blur,
is what it looked like.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.242 align:middle line:84%
As it was going up, it
started to have these lights

00:10:51.242 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
on each corner
start to illuminate.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It was red, yellow,
green, and blue.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:90%
But it was only one on each.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's say if one corner was
red, it didn't change colors.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:90%
That was just a red corner.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.047 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
illuminated the whole time.

00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:90%
But it was still rotating.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
The pitch of that hum did
not change at all, even

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:84%
from raising up
to the tree line.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
took off, it had

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
to have been thousands of
miles an hour, instantaneous.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The thing that was so
interesting about this

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that it
didn't disturb the trees.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
There was coconuts on
the top of the trees.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Those didn't move.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.050 align:middle line:90%
There was no rotor wash.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:90%
There was no exhaust wash.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.762 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
that was disturbed.

00:11:27.762 --> 00:11:29.398 align:middle line:84%
It was just
completely-- so fast.

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't disturb anything.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:90%
So it was very eerie to see.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned that
there was a truck directly

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:90%
underneath it.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And then it
lowered over the truck.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And it absorbed the truck?

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.802 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So I
didn't see the truck.

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I just saw the platform
raised, went like this.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't see a truck,
actually, on the platform.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
What I--

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Cargo container or--

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.345 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I didn't see
how they unloaded anything.

00:11:50.345 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The only-- because
we're going through,

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
seeing this in the
background, to this team,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:90%
also stripping us of our gear.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So you're going back
and forth between.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not 100% focused on
this because you got guys

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:90%
pointing their muzzles at you.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you're
in your own head, thinking,

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
what are these guys
going to do next?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they didn't
go with the craft?

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:90%
They stayed there--

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: They stayed there.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --on site?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how
did they get there?

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, all right.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
There's theories
to that, obviously.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Their own transportation,
by any means.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned the
lights on the craft, the red,

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:90%
green, yellow, blue.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Were they just around
the center part?

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Or are they around the edges?

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They're
around the edges.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: OK, all the way around
the whole 300 feet of this

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: So just the corners.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Just the corner.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Each sharp
corner had that light.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, the octagons.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.018 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what's the height
of that craft, do you think?

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: If I was
to have estimate,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I would say probably--

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:90%
maybe 50 feet, if that.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So it was very--

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.290 align:middle line:84%
it was 300 feet long
but probably 50 feet

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.712 align:middle line:84%
from the bottom to the top
of the pyramid structure that

00:12:51.712 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:90%
was on the top of that craft.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
At least that's
what it looked like.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
When it was rotating, you could
see the shadow pitch, at least

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.135 align:middle line:84%
from every corner of
that pyramid on the top.

00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looked like.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was the outside of the
craft rotating or just a single

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:90%
line of it?

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just the
lights rotating?

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Or was the whole
craft, you just saw--

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:90%
and how fast was it rotating?

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So it was rotating--
the whole craft was rotating.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
As far as speed, it
wasn't going very fast.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It was just very
constant, just smooth.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was weird because
when I was sitting there,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
hovering, it's not going up
and down like people think,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
when they assume it's
just completely still.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's just rotating.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's set in
stone and it's moving.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the weirdest description
that I can accurately give.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.962 align:middle line:84%
If somebody saw this and
they saw how it moved it--

00:13:36.962 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right, fascinating.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Well, tell us.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:90%
You're at gunpoint.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:90%
This craft is taking off.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
What did they do
next to you guys?

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So after they had
our weapons-- so we had M16A4s.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I was a saw gunner by trade,
which was a belt-fed machine

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
gun, a hell of a weapon.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So they gave us M16A4s
instead because we're

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:90%
doing humanitarian.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.313 align:middle line:84%
We were in condition
four at the time.

00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:90%
We weren't in condition one.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.782 align:middle line:84%
And so then I took
our magazine out.

00:14:02.782 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:84%
They actually-- the way that
they handled the weapon,

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
you can tell they've
done this several times.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.683 align:middle line:84%
They pulled the charging
handle to the rear.

00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, no casing
came out or anything

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:90%
like that, no live round.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And they took our
magazines out of our vests.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Usually we have what's
called brass to the grass.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%
So they took those out.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
They kicked them probably
outside the standoff distance

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to make sure we
couldn't reach for them.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And as they were
checking our weapons,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.265 align:middle line:84%
they actually took
our military IDs out

00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
of breast pocket, our
left breast pocket.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So these guys knew
where our military IDs

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
were, which is the other
suspicion that these guys were

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
former military
because I don't know

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
about other military
branches, as far

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.128 align:middle line:84%
as where they're supposed
to keep their military IDs.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
But for us, it was always in our
left breast pocket, as well as

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.955 align:middle line:84%
note-taking gear
if you needed that.

00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So they knew where
our stuff was.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
They had this device
that reminded me

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of a biometric system
that we were trained on.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And they kept trying to look--

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:90%
scan our IDs with this.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.628 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
able to do that.

00:14:53.628 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
They were getting
frustrated with it.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So then they had
this other thing,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that looked like a
modern-day cell phone

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.250 align:middle line:84%
because phones, back
then, were bulky, big.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I had a Sony Ericsson
MP3 phone that

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:90%
was the thing back in the day.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is ancient
compared to what we got now.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.997 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what year
was this, for the audience?

00:15:08.997 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: 2009.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Yep, 14 years ago.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.868 align:middle line:84%
So they took pictures of IDs,
front and back, of course.

00:15:15.868 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They put it back in
our left breast pocket.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:90%
They had a weapon.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So they told us to turn
around and face that slope

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:90%
that we came down.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, no.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.445 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And at that point,
I thought that we were done

00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:26.505 align:middle line:84%
for because you know
as well as I do--

00:15:26.505 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I know what
that means, yeah.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And thankfully it
didn't happen because I'm here

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:90%
talking to you.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So after we
turn and face that slope,

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.488 align:middle line:84%
they slung our
weapons on our back.

00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But they slung them
so tight that you

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get them off yourself.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had our neck
protectors, that had this yoke.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.233 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
putting the sling on--

00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:84%
because I could see
the sling come over.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.317 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, crap, they're
going to choke me or something

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.807 align:middle line:90%
So they put the sling over.

00:15:54.807 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And it actually cut into my neck
because they were roughing it

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were
trying to adjust it

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to where it was so
tight against our body.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they took
our magazines and they

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
put them brass facing
towards the sky.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So even if you were
to reach for it,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to fumble for it.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
By the time you land
anything, they actually

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:90%
have the drop on you already.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:90%
They'll just kill you.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So these guys knew exactly
what they were doing.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.010 align:middle line:84%
must have been nerve
wracking for all of you guys.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: It was.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.443 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How were you
responding, everyone?

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Did anyone flip out and
try to fight back or--

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:90%
We were outgunned at that point.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.093 align:middle line:84%
And the way these
guys's tactics were,

00:16:23.093 --> 00:16:26.668 align:middle line:84%
they were overly aggressive,
which understandably, us as a--

00:16:26.668 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And speaking English?

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.923 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:16:28.923 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Just like how you and I are.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.215 align:middle line:90%
There's no English accents.

00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no Australian
accents or anything

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:90%
that's very identifiable.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.942 align:middle line:84%
It's just how you
and I are talking.

00:16:35.942 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What happened next?

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So they told
us to go up the slope.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:90%
But we had all our gear back on.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.447 align:middle line:84%
And they kept telling us, don't
look back, we'll kill you,

00:16:43.447 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
we'll shoot you,
hey, we can throw you

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.975 align:middle line:90%
guys off a helicopter.

00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to get lost
out here in the jungle.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And nobody would ever find you.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
They just kept saying
stuff like that.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They were
threatening you the whole way.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.442 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: The whole way.

00:16:52.442 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:90%
They weren't, obviously, nice.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we broke
the top of that slope,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
we basically took off,
running back to the LZ

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
where they were having
helicopters come in.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good
distance, 300 meters.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:90%
You're trying to run--

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they said,
walk up this hill.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.769 align:middle line:90%
Don't turn around.

00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yep.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And was there
an endpoint to the hill?

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So it
came up to the top,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:90%
where we were originally at.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.109 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: That's
where we were supposed

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:90%
to be until we saw this happen.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And then so we basically
hightailed it back to the LZ

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.202 align:middle line:90%
from that original point.

00:17:20.202 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:84%
And we had our weapons
on our back, of course,

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
know if we were

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:90%
following us the whole way.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we just
decided to hightail it.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Just keep going.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Because we were
still in view of other people.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Getting at least closer,
probably within maybe 50 meters

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:84%
or so, we could
start seeing people.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What did they
do with your comms?

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: We didn't
have any comms.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, nothing.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, everybody
thinks in the military,

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:90%
life is lavish, with this--

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.632 align:middle line:90%
you're lucky to get comms.

00:17:40.632 --> 00:17:42.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
Marines I know that went

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to Iraq and Afghanistan,
that didn't have any comms.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.610 align:middle line:90%
A lot of operations, they did.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have
hand-and-arm signals,

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:90%
other ways to communicate.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.465 align:middle line:84%
Mike, what have
you learned about

00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:52.117 align:middle line:90%
these black covert programs?

00:17:52.117 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, they're
very sophisticated.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of moving parts.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And how they have them
compartmentalized and kept

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
secrets, very
amazing, how they keep

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:84%
it segmented from other people,
doing similar operations.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.587 align:middle line:84%
So the organization itself
is a global organization.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:08.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the United States.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a certain
part of the country.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:90%
It spans the entire globe.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I said
before, these teams

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
came into creation around 1947,
when the National Security Act.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So with this subject,
coming to find out

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
who was exactly
responsible for this

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
was very surprising
because normally

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
when you have
something like this,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
especially briefing
the Pentagon,

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
at least the AARO Office,
Senate Intelligence Committee

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of other
senators, politicians,

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that at least are
interested in this

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to hear about it.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:84%
It's never anybody on the inside
that actually comes and says,

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
hey, yes, this is
the organization

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that's responsible,
that they're a part of.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So because of that reason,
some of these people

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
wanted to come forward.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, they used
me as a voice for them.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they're
relaying information to me

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and telling me what
I, exactly, witnessed

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.525 align:middle line:90%
and what the purpose of it was.

00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You said you were
surprised to find out who they

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:90%
So who exactly was that?

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, they are tapped
from Special Operations, JSOC,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:90%
more specifically.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's contractors,
if you will.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
The specifics of
it are so clouded.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
There's not a specific
name that, at least,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I can refer them to.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
It's just Black Team.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But their purpose, obviously,
is this more covert stuff

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
that's even more secretive
and what the CIA is doing,

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.515 align:middle line:90%
anything like that.

00:19:27.515 --> 00:19:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Above them.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.575 align:middle line:90%
Above top secret.

00:19:30.575 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Pretty
much, which is crazy.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever find out who
was responsible for that UAP

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:90%
encounter you had?

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, just this
organization as a whole.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to ask them if they
knew directly, and they don't.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So Mike, how do
they keep these technologies

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:90%
so secret?

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:90%
These craft are so large.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.067 align:middle line:84%
They should show up
on radar, at least.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, everybody's
got the misconception

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
that they think radar
picks up everything.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:84%
These computer-generated
systems, or at least that they

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
program, they keep
them within parameters

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:90%
of tracking certain things.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.158 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes
to stuff like this,

00:20:05.158 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:84%
they're purposely not tracking
them because obviously, they'd

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
be tracking a lot of them
if that was the case.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So any radar operators
watching this probably

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.373 align:middle line:84%
knows what I'm talking
about in reference to that.

00:20:14.373 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Now the ones in the '50s
and the older radar systems,

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:90%
those tracked everything.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So now that they actually
have programs and parameters

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.053 align:middle line:84%
that they set for
individual systems--

00:20:23.053 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:84%
so that's why
they're not tracked.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of eye-witness accounts,
that's the first thing.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.165 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a sudden, I
come to stealth technologies,

00:20:29.165 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
with to B-2, B-21 Raider,
F-117, even the F-35 or even

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
F-22, those planes, they have
Radar-Absorbing Material, RAM,

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
as they call it, among other
different signatures that

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:90%
don't even show up as a plane.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Probably show up as a bird
or something that doesn't--

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So the
programs, you're saying,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:84%
are pre-programmed for the
radars around the world so they

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:90%
cannot see this--

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --this anomaly.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Now there are certain
radar systems that do,

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:84%
such as the ones
we have at NORAD.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they track a
lot of different things.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they're
aware of this at NORAD?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: 100%.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.323 align:middle line:84%
There's even been some whistle
blowers that came forward

00:21:03.323 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
from NORAD, operating
those systems,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:90%
FAA operators, things like that.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What other agencies
are aware of this besides

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:84%
NORAD, other
three-letter agencies?

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And what part of the agency,
if you could mention,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:90%
knows about it?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, a lot of
these agencies do, FBI, CIA.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: CIA.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:20.883 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They all--
they're aware of this.

00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, Black Team
is so woven into everything,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:90%
even the media, even to--

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
it's like a secret
society, if you will.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:90%
They are woven into everything.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And their purpose is
to run these covertly

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and to spread disinformation
so nobody knows where to look.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
They have people that
are in their pockets.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.130 align:middle line:84%
They make their own
money with doing

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.293 align:middle line:84%
various activities, which I've
not specifically read in on.

00:21:44.293 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that
they embezzle funds

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
from the Black Budget as well as
other means to get that money.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they have access
to other technologies besides

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:90%
these craft?

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Weapon systems,
very advanced stuff.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:90%
There's other technologies.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So this group that
wants to come out,

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:84%
they had told me
that transport's

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:84%
boring in comparison to the
other stuff that they got.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Flying is boring.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
They said, everybody is
so enamored with the UFOs,

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.763 align:middle line:84%
there's stuff that they
have that's way more

00:22:12.763 --> 00:22:17.638 align:middle line:84%
advanced than that stuff, which
there's some stuff I know, more

00:22:17.638 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:84%
specifically, with
the weapon systems

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:90%
because that's what they use.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.482 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When you say
these radar algorithms are

00:22:22.482 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:90%
controlled, who's behind that?

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm going to
suspect it's this organization.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:90%
They're unregulated.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
They're not overseen by
any federal government

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
agency, Senate, White House,
military office, per se,

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.552 align:middle line:84%
the president--
there's only a couple

00:22:37.552 --> 00:22:39.343 align:middle line:84%
of presidents that knew
of their existence.

00:22:39.343 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And that was Bill Clinton.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So of course, he was waived
off this subject, of course.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So they have a lot of
influence with these agencies.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the stuff
that they do is

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
going to filter down
to the operatives that

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
are in these agencies to
basically program or do

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever these guys need to do
in order to keep this quiet.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If the president
is aware of the Black Team,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
does that mean it's more
powerful than our own US Armed

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Forces?

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes because they have
technologies that are thousands

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.493 align:middle line:90%
of years more advanced.

00:23:08.493 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Conventional weapons systems
would probably be ineffective

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:90%
compared to what they've got.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
They probably have
means of force fields.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
They have
frequency-based weapons

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:90%
that could do damage to things.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
What I learned, going
through all of this,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
is that anything
can be possible.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:90%
It's speculation.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And the only weapon
system I know of

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.663 align:middle line:84%
is these very advanced
EMPs that they've got.

00:23:29.663 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they target these
craft, with scalar longitudinal

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So stuff in conventional
craft-- or stuff like that,

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.327 align:middle line:84%
against conventional
aircraft, is

00:23:38.327 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:84%
going to be thousands
of years more advanced

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:84%
compared to just a 50-cal
round, for example,

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:90%
firing at aircraft.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right, of course.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Or even a
30-millimeter cannon.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That would be archaic.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Right.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If they're more
powerful than our own military

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and we're not an
opposition to them,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:90%
then who's running that show?

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.325 align:middle line:84%
But these are very
important people, at least

00:23:55.325 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:90%
to my understanding.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be all the
way from the top down,

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.955 align:middle line:84%
as far as the
White House knowing

00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:84%
about this, at least
certain people.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.023 align:middle line:84%
Granted, there's
disinformation agents

00:24:04.023 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that are implanted
in all these agencies

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:84%
to basically-- if somebody
tries to look into this,

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:84%
they get waved off, threatened,
maybe bought into it as well.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
They throw them a sum of
money and say, here you go,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:90%
don't ever talk about this.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't
work, then there's

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.912 align:middle line:84%
been people who've been
murdered over this,

00:24:18.912 --> 00:24:21.488 align:middle line:84%
that have the information
or tried to look into this.

00:24:21.488 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How many people
are involved with this thing,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:90%
like the numbers?

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, a global
organization that obviously

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:84%
spans every country,
they don't--

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:84%
by any means, they don't respect
borders of other countries

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
they operate however
they want to.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.688 align:middle line:84%
I know of a specific event
that they were doing--

00:24:38.688 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like hundreds
of thousands or thousands

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:90%
of people?

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I would say it's
a relatively small number.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.553 align:middle line:84%
But globally, I would say
probably hundreds of thousands

00:24:46.553 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of people, just estimating.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know personally.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But I know that it's
relatively small.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You were captured
by the Black Team and now

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about them.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Are you exposing them or
are you disinforming us?

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I'm
exposing what they've

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
been doing because a lot of the
people in this organization,

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:90%
they have families, if you will.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:90%
They're married.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:90%
They have morals.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They were being misled on what
they were doing because they

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:84%
thought that what
they were doing

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
was for the betterment
of this country,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:84%
helping everybody
as a whole, us being

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:90%
a superpower of the world.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But come to find out how
they're being misled.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the illegal
stuff that they're doing,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
crimes such as murdering
innocent people, kidnapping,

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
slavery, human trafficking,
which these programs not really

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.528 align:middle line:84%
relate to that
because these people

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:90%
volunteer for these operations.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've
talked about earlier.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if the other
extent of it could be that.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:90%
But they're doing illegal stuff.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, you just
mentioned that these people

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:84%
were doing this patriotically
for our country,

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.110 align:middle line:84%
which is making me believe
that this is definitely ran

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.875 align:middle line:90%
by the United States only.

00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:52.675 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Globally.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Globally?

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So since 1947, you
have, obviously,

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.500 align:middle line:84%
changing of the guard, if
you will, with politicians.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They're leaving
office, whatever it is.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's getting diluted, as
far as people knowing it.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, since
the 1940s, people

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
have passed on, who
have known about this.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So the more and more and more
time goes on, the more diluted

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge gets of
this team's existence.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Now only from being told, face
to face, by some of these guys,

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.390 align:middle line:84%
that Clinton was the one
who had awareness to this--

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
and obviously, he got waved off.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.893 align:middle line:84%
Now in a global
comparison, I have no idea

00:26:27.893 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
if there's any other
government officials that

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
are in Parliament, for
example, in the UK,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:90%
that probably know about this.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that
there's people who do.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes up
to an organization that

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
has technology that's thousands
of years more advanced, that

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
can run circles around the
most sophisticated aircraft

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that we have, you're talking
about something that puts fear

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
in their hearts
and in their minds

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.942 align:middle line:84%
because they know that
if that's the most

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated and advanced
stuff that we've got

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's archaic
to what they have,

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
then that conventional
government does not

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.188 align:middle line:90%
stand a chance.

00:26:57.188 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mike, where do you
stand in relation to this?

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Are a whistleblower
or are you just trying

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to get the information out?

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I'm a whistleblower.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But I am trying to get
the information out

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
on the behalf of
these people that

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:84%
want to get out of this
organization as a whole.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this organization
a byproduct of Majestic 12?

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.525 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I suspect
it would be just

00:27:16.525 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature of
what they're involved with

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and what they're dealing with.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we know what
Majestic 12's purpose was.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming it's
hand in hand with that.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is the
Black Teams divided?

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:90%
What's your position on this?

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So
being face to face,

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
at least, with both
spectrums of this,

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:84%
obviously they're not-so-nice
people and then the ones that

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:84%
actually want this to
come out and be exposed,

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but in doing so, keeping
people safe about it,

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
understanding the
screening process of how

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.813 align:middle line:84%
they pick these
people, obviously,

00:27:46.813 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:84%
they have people
that have a set--

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
skills, Special
Operations, so to speak.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But they also screen
people, particularly,

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to be more of the psychopathic
or sociopathic type of people,

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that can carry out the
illegal stuff, that

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:84%
don't have conscious attitude
to say, no, morally, this is not

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So the people that
are OK with it

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:84%
obviously do the
more sinister stuff.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.120 align:middle line:84%
The people that actually
have a problem with that

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are relaying
the information to me,

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
from what they understand that
there is a war within the Black

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Team, of them going
against each other.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Right.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So there is
something going on in there?

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And are there separate
leaders for each one of those

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:90%
that are heading all that off?

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a group effort?

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It might be a group
effort from what I understand.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there's
key leaders in with that,

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:90%
as far as it's concerned.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
obviously, it's

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:84%
a byproduct of people that
were, one time, in the military,

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:84%
on top of the contracting
companies that exist nowadays.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's very woven
into that aspect of it,

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:90%
just keeping secret.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But I do understand that there
is a war within the Black Team

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:90%
that I was told.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the good part of
this group wants to do a soft

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
disclosure of what's
really going on?

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And
you're part of that?

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.815 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm
their voice, trying

00:29:01.815 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:84%
to get this information
out, so that way the public

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:90%
knows what's going on.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, if the
public knows and the government

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.872 align:middle line:90%
already knows as well--

00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:10.330 align:middle line:84%
my whole thing with
this was trying

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to get the government
to intervene,

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.080 align:middle line:84%
at least with what I
witnessed, because it

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:90%
is criminal activity.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact
that there have

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
been people that
have been murdered,

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that were in the shoes
that I as being a witness.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thankful every
single day that I was not

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:90%
a part of that body count.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Now the good guys that
know about those operations

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:84%
were able to at least provide
insight to why they do it,

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
which completely makes sense,
why they do it that way.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Do I agree with it?

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But at the same token, the
way they relayed that to me

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
was almost like if
the United States was

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
to try to find a cheaper labor
source outside this country,

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:90%
they'd do the same thing--

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
but people that have a higher
consciousness or a depth

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, if you
will, that can participate

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:middle line:90%
in these operations.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We talked about all
these advanced technologies,

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:90%
Mike.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Where are they keeping these?

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Is there a facility of
sorts around the planet?

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.763 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:30:07.763 --> 00:30:09.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of facilities
around the planet.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And they all span
underground, by the way.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these bases
actually connect underground.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.165 align:middle line:84%
And they use a
maglev train system,

00:30:16.165 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:84%
at least for the closest
installations underground.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And they have a separate
communications array,

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it that, that only

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:84%
communicates underground,
that does not come topside.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these installations,
they look like nothing up top.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.863 align:middle line:84%
They look like
abandoned of facilities.

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:90%
They could look just--

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's nothing
to look at over here

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.510 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
draw attention.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But everything underground is
where all the exciting stuff

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.030 align:middle line:84%
happens, as well as if they're
doing operations, topside.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Now these facilities, they do
not have a permanent flight

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
restriction, like what you would
see like a Space Force base.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.422 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of military
installation

00:30:50.422 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
that people know about
have a restricted access

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.315 align:middle line:84%
only to military
personnel, flying in.

00:30:54.315 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Then obviously,
they can do that.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But they put what's
called TFRs up,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Temporary Flight Restrictions.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So it restricts all the way to
60,000 feet, which there's not

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of aircraft in
this present day that

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:90%
can fly up that high.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So that covers a
wide range of things.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.970 align:middle line:84%
The other thing as well,
because they have temporary,

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't put a big
red flag in that area.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have something
like a desert, if you will,

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.850 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing topside,
at least if it has a couple

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.410 align:middle line:84%
buildings, then people start to
get curious and find out, OK,

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Why is this area restricted?

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mother--
TFRed all the time?

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That would
throw a red flag.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.057 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
do it that way.

00:31:31.057 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But these
craft are so large.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're keeping them,
what, underground then?

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's some sort
of-- these spaces are--

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.160 align:middle line:84%
what type of spaces
are we looking at here,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.577 align:middle line:84%
with these facilities
underground?

00:31:42.577 --> 00:31:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well,
they're massive.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I've heard instances that
could span several miles, maybe

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:90%
a cubic mile underground.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.730 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty
massive underground.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No, absolutely.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So to house these
advanced technologies under

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.720 align:middle line:84%
there, it's the easiest
way because two--

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
you don't have people that
can see it from topside.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything crucial is going
to be stored underground,

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.770 align:middle line:84%
or in space, as a
matter of fact too,

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because they have
stuff that orbits,

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that nobody knows
about, including myself.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I've heard them say
stuff like this.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.092 align:middle line:90%
But I can't verify that.

00:32:16.092 --> 00:32:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm
floating up there

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, that's
one of their projects.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.793 align:middle line:84%
Everything they keep crucial
is going to be underground.

00:32:22.793 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:84%
One, if there's an asteroid
that hits accidentally

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
or if there's nuclear fallout
or a nuclear exchange, even

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.660 align:middle line:90%
artillery range--

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
so if they're trying
to bomb these bases--

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.533 align:middle line:84%
so let's say if Russia decides
to do something or China,

00:32:35.533 --> 00:32:37.450 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to be
susceptible to getting

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.380 align:middle line:90%
damaged by that.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.338 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Right and they
have force fields too,

00:32:40.338 --> 00:32:43.157 align:middle line:84%
and all these other high-tech,
defensive technologies.

00:32:43.157 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Now force fields,
I am assuming that they do,

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.740 align:middle line:84%
because they have
hologram projections.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the black sites they
have in the Chihuahuan Desert

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.640 align:middle line:90%
looks like a mountain.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mountain.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It actually is a hologram
that emits this illusion

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:90%
that it's a mountain.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So they had this manuscript
that they gave me,

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.283 align:middle line:84%
explaining an
event that was very

00:33:02.283 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:90%
similar to what I witnessed.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was in 2004 in
the Chihuahuan Desert.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.185 align:middle line:84%
And they talked
about them flying

00:33:08.185 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
into this hologram
with the helicopters

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and with these containers, of
the same containers that I saw,

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:84%
with the cylinder on top
for the HVAC systems,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.070 align:middle line:90%
which had people in them.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And at least they
had a drone that

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.040 align:middle line:84%
was observing the
helicopters, that they

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:84%
thought it was a suicide
mission because they're going

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:25.893 align:middle line:90%
to fly into this mountain.

00:33:25.893 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, why are they doing that?

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of a sudden, they
just pass right through

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and land onto a platform
that goes underground.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are those holographic
devices being projected from

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.827 align:middle line:90%
space or from the ground?

00:33:36.827 --> 00:33:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: From the ground
from what I understand.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.770 align:middle line:84%
They have ground
sensors, obviously,

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.540 align:middle line:84%
so they can track
movement with that.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:84%
They have EMPs, obviously, to
mobilize any kind of vehicles

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:90%
that we've got.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.707 align:middle line:84%
At least if you're trying
to go investigate this,

00:33:48.707 --> 00:33:51.040 align:middle line:84%
they have other means to
protect themselves and at least

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.840 align:middle line:90%
obscure.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So if something looks
like a mountain,

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.010 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to look
of interest to people.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why does our
conventional military allow

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:84%
this new Black Ops force to
blatantly go wherever they want

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.405 align:middle line:84%
and do anything
they want on Earth?

00:34:08.405 --> 00:34:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, there's a
couple reasons why it happens.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.080 align:middle line:84%
One, because of the technologies
that look-- the stigma itself,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:90%
of UFOs has been--

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
this had a stigma ever since
the '50s, little green men.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
They tried to make it a subject
to where discredits itself.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.043 align:middle line:90%
And they've done that very well.

00:34:23.043 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody sees
anything and they

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
try to report it
like I have, that

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.199 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the things that was
very in the back of my mind,

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.239 align:middle line:84%
that nobody would take this
serious, especially talking

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:84%
to some important people
in the government.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Now the other thing
is too, the people

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.120 align:middle line:84%
that know of this Black Team's
existence in the government,

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:84%
in the military, are people
either bought and paid

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.498 align:middle line:84%
for by them or
they're a part of it.

00:34:41.498 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they're able to do it.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.389 align:middle line:84%
So if they have generals, if you
will, that are a part of this

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:84%
or know about it, but
they're paid under the table

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.462 align:middle line:84%
or they're a part of it, they're
not going to say anything.

00:34:51.462 --> 00:34:53.920 align:middle line:84%
They're going to keep doing
what they're doing because it's

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:90%
making them a lot of money.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Would you say the
majority of sightings that

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
civilians see are basically
these alien-reproduction

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:90%
vehicles?

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, 80%
of them, if you will.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Now the only reason
why I can say this

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
is because they have confirmed
to me a lot of the cases,

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.070 align:middle line:90%
they're reverse engineered.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So they have the rivets,
the seams, bolts, stuff

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:84%
that you can tell
it's manufactured.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Now the ones that are
completely seamless--

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:84%
because crash
retrievals that they

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
do of ET craft, the installation
that I went to specifically,

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
they deal with at least
two or three of these craft

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:84%
being shot down a
year, two or three.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Now think about this.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And this team's been
around since the '40s.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And they've had
installations that do this.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.187 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about, over
the span of its existence,

00:35:38.187 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
it could be like 80
craft that they've

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.090 align:middle line:90%
shot down at one location.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, right, at least.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And if you're
talking about the grand scheme

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:84%
of things globally,
that's a lot of ET craft

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.050 align:middle line:84%
that they're shooting
down a year in the big,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in the grand scheme of things.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So they come across a
lot of stuff like that.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They've told me that craft
that they've taken down

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:90%
was completely seamless.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.503 align:middle line:84%
It has no methods
of manufacturing,

00:35:57.503 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:84%
like panels or
anything like that.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just one solid piece.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.180 align:middle line:90%
But it feels organic to them.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do you think
the Black Team's objective is,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
their agenda, to say, with
you coming out on "Cosmic

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Disclosure" with me?

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.083 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, obviously, the
good guys in this organization

00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:14.300 align:middle line:84%
want this to come out
and because obviously,

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:84%
this is a platform that
allows this to happen.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So them giving me
the information

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and providing me with the
assets to know exactly what I'm

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:84%
being told, making sure that I
do understand it so that way,

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I can get the
viewers and people--

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.670 align:middle line:84%
at least because you have
a very wide audience,

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:34.250 align:middle line:84%
may either be in the
military, even in politics.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
This is going to span
the entire world as far

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.207 align:middle line:84%
as this information
being put out.

00:36:38.207 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So the good guys want
to separate themselves

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:84%
with getting to me the right
information to expose this,

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:84%
at the same time doing with
what they're dealing with,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:84%
either them trying to
come out and either

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
on the back end of things,
such as what they've

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:84%
been doing already, as well
as even using me as a means

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:90%
to get this information out.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's the whole point that
they're doing with me, at least

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
to provide the public what
the understanding of why

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:90%
this happens.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is your life in
danger, Mike, by doing this?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: 100%.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.202 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at it is every
time you get in your car,

00:37:10.202 --> 00:37:12.410 align:middle line:84%
you're taking a risk because
obviously, car accidents

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.603 align:middle line:84%
are one of the number-one
killers in this country.

00:37:14.603 --> 00:37:16.770 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
variables that can happen.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.080 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.600 align:middle line:84%
The reason why things
are not being done

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
is because people
are afraid of that.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So in order to get stuff to
actually change in this world,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.080 align:middle line:84%
such as this disclosure maybe
getting this technology out--

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.270 align:middle line:84%
these guys are taking a
big risk by providing me

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking a big risk
because obviously, I'm

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:90%
keeping bad people up at night.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I've had the instances
with helicopters

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.070 align:middle line:90%
hovering over my house.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:84%
They're harassing my wife and
myself, my dad, for instance.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.640 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to play games.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But also, we've got
protections in place, not only

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
from the federal government,
but also other teams

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.240 align:middle line:90%
that are keeping us safe too.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So they've given me
information as far as

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.317 align:middle line:84%
how to track the aircraft
that comes and harasses us,

00:37:58.317 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:84%
which hasn't happened
in a little bit.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But every now and
then, it happens.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:03.650 align:middle line:90%

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:90%
