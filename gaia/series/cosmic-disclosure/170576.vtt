>>DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
back to Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And here again with me
is Emery Smith, a friend

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:90%
of mine for the last 10 years.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:84%
I've been leaning on you
for a decade to do this,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:90%
and you finally have.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you, Emery.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And thank you on behalf of all
people in the world who want

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.814 align:middle line:90%
freedom and full disclosure.

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Oh, thanks
for having me, Dave.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.604 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: We were actually
driving in the car.

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about the
bodies that you'd autopsied.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But then you told me something
in the car that I think

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
sheds some deeper light
on your experience.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like us to
go into that part

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
now, even though I think it's
farther along in your career.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But it helps to establish
a fundamental truth, which

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
is that insiders, typically,
when you get a real one,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
they have lots of different,
cool things that they've done.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%
So, tell us about the Vatican.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, the
Vatican, yes, yes.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:10%
So, a private organization went
to the DOD and the mill labs

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:10%
I was working at.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And they needed some
technicians and some scientists

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to go to the Vatican to
look at their archives,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that they
had some information on a craft

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:90%
that was taken in New Mexico.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, there
had been a UFO--

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That was shot down.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.455 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it
was a recent one.

00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, very recent.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:90%
And they took this craft--

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why would
they shoot it down?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Was it hostile?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Did it do anything bad?

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no, no, not at all.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
No, it just got too close to
some of the weapons up there

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and from what I heard,
from the debriefing.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where it crashed.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.796 align:middle line:90%
I just know where it was at.

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do we know
anything about what

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
this craft looked like
or what kind of occupants

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:90%
they found inside?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, there was no
occupants that was mentioned.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But the craft did look
like a tetrahedron.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
The best way I could put it
is make a tetrahedron out

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.939 align:middle line:90%
of PVC pipes.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:10.739 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.539 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yep.

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.953 align:middle line:84%
And about eight
feet in diameter.

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it has a light
in the middle of it.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And this was
like a robotic drone?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It always
stays centered.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It could have been.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But then again, a lot of these
craft are conscious, actually.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And it can-- every now
and then, it'll strobe.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.395 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll
fill up the spaces,

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:35.214 align:middle line:90%
so you can't see through it.

00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What will
fill up spaces?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like I just said,
it was an empty tetrahedron

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.615 align:middle line:90%
made out of PVC pipe.

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:41.415 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, you
could see through it,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and you could see the
light in the middle.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What color
was the orb of light?

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was blue.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.451 align:middle line:84%
But it was very small,
like probably three inches

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the tetrahedron
itself was white?

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The outside of it
was like if you made one

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:84%
with PVC pipe and it was
pure white, it was seamless.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.406 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And if you
got too close to it,

00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:84%
it would actually
fill in a space of--

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.075 align:middle line:90%
that you could not see into it.

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:09.535 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But I still don't
know if I understand.

00:03:09.535 --> 00:03:11.874 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: OK, so, if you
have an empty tetrahedron

00:03:11.874 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:90%
that you can see through it.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're only talking
about the outside lines, OK?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, you
could see through it,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:90%
and you can see this ball.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.249 align:middle line:84%
And if you get too close to
it, it'll actually go solid.

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This
tetrahedron goes solid?

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And then what
does it look like?

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's just white.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just white.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, pure white.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, this appears to
have been some kind of drone.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:90%
There were no occupants in it.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There was
no occupants, but it

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean-- because
that white light could

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.226 align:middle line:90%
be some sort of consciousness.

00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Or a being, right.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Or a being.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So, you cannot-- any
time you see light,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
you have to think being
first and then go from there.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, you're
saying, if I'm

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
getting this right, that
the Department of Defense

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
had this craft,
or whatever it is,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:90%
get shot down in New Mexico.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're drawing a
blank as to what it is

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:90%
or where it came from.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.375 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I don't know
where it was shot down.

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I just know it was
stored in New Mexico,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.690 align:middle line:90%
because that's where I was at.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:90%
But it was a first of its kind.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:90%
So, they had--

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But they have a
very robust idea of what

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.210 align:middle line:90%
normally would crash, correct?

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.676 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: They have
an extensive catalog?

00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have an extensive
collection, I will say.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But this skewed the
charts in some way.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it gave off
different, I guess,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.546 align:middle line:84%
frequencies or something
that they were amazed about.

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't show any
aggression or whatever

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:90%
after it was shot down.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was still
obviously operational.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you say that
this craft was in the category

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
where it appears that
the material itself

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:90%
is a life form somehow?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I don't
know about that, because I

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in on that part.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that ball
on the inside had energy.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So, energy and light
always could mean life.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.074 align:middle line:84%
So, what did they decide
to do about this craft?

00:04:58.074 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
If they don't know what it
is, they don't know where

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
it came from, what
kind of resources

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
can they draw upon
at that point?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.684 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, what they
do is they form a team.

00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And they do a big background
check around the world,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
because there's other
catalogs in other countries

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:90%
and other religions.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the Vatican has
always been a huge database.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It has a huge archive of many
things, artifacts and things

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
they have found
from space and have

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:84%
collected over many,
many, many, many years.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And they have an underground
base under the Vatican.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So, two scientists and myself
were deployed to that area

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to the Vatican to an undisclosed
location in the Vatican.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And we took an elevator down
about seven or eight floors.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it all started.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We got permission
from the Vatican.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.534 align:middle line:90%
They set it all up.

00:05:45.534 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
We're just contractors
going there

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
to collect any type of
information that would

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:90%
be similar to this device.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, is it
common that there

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:90%
is interagency cooperation?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.325 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:05:56.325 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Usually for exchange for favors.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, you are an
Air Force veteran, right?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And we've often
heard from various insiders

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that there's an Air Force wing
of the military industrial

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:90%
complex and a Navy wing.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
They broke off
after World War II--

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's true.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they've grown
into these totally separate

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.447 align:middle line:90%
industrial complexes.

00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's very true.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, would you estimate
that most of your experience is

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Air Force side, because
that's where you started, or--

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, for
this particular thing,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I would say so.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But they still work together
when they have questions.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:90%
They're not banging heads.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But they do like to keep
their secrets together,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:84%
because the more they
can show the government,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.059 align:middle line:84%
the more money they can
get at the end of the year.

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So, if I have some
really cool things

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that I've collected this year
for this corporation, this mill

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.049 align:middle line:84%
lab or Air Force mill lab,
then we get more money.

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, they don't
always share the secrets

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
of what they're doing.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But they do always work
together to figure out things

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:90%
that they can't figure out.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They work always-- they're
very compliant with that.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, I think the
military budget, even

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:84%
on-the-books military
budget, recently

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
was in the neighborhood
of $864 billion,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
the ridiculous $700 toilet
seats and that kind of thing,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and the little
nuts that cost $65.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, the idea being
that the military budget

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of room in it for
off balance sheet expenditures.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That is correct.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You could get a
toilet seat for $700.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And they will go to Home
Depot and buy it for $2.00.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:90%
And they'll buy 2,000 of them.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of
that money goes where?

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.073 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, apparently,
you guys are fighting over it

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:35.446 align:middle line:90%
is what you're telling me now.

00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like a healthy--

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is a competition.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.754 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Competition.

00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But from my
experience, I mean,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not one
of the executives

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:84%
there by far or their
financial advisors,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
but just from what I heard
from some of the higher

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
upper-class people in
there that they usually

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:90%
always get about the same.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.795 align:middle line:84%
They're not beating them
by billions of dollars.

00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:90%
And it is actually not billions.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:90%
It's trillions.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.111 align:middle line:84%
When you encounter
all the other ways

00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:90%
that money is being generated.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, if we have
this craft that comes down,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know what it is,
just in a very general sense

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:84%
if you can speculate-- and
I understand you might not

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.699 align:middle line:90%
have definitive knowledge.

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:90%
But I'd like your speculations.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be probably
better than mine.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
How often do you think this
kind of stuff is happening?

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Daily.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Daily?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:90%
There's crashes of UFOs daily?

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.444 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, they may be--

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I would not
have expected that.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're
actually identified,

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.540 align:middle line:84%
because when we say
UFO, we're thinking--

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Vehicles.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Vehicles.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot of vehicles
that are recovered from space

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
or shot down from space and then
recovered and brought back too.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.515 align:middle line:84%
And they're not always, of
course, inhabited at all.

00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:52.944 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these things
too, actually, it's

00:08:52.944 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:90%
like the Trojan horse.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
They want us to
bring this in here,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.092 align:middle line:84%
so we can learn
about good technology

00:08:59.092 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and can reverse
engineer something.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: A positive
Trojan horse.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, a very
possible Trojan horse.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Not like
an AI infestation--

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.953 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --that swarm
over the planet.

00:09:07.953 --> 00:09:09.405 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, not at all.

00:09:09.405 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So, and that's what it's so
exciting that the scientists do

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:90%
realize that.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the corporations
also learn about that.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.401 align:middle line:84%
The sad part is once
they figure it out,

00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
it's forever for it to
come to the public for us

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.094 align:middle line:84%
to use to help make
our lives better.

00:09:24.094 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: All right, I'm
still a little reeling here,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:90%
and probably they are too.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Every day?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Every day?

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.956 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, every day.

00:09:32.956 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Wouldn't
there be people

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%
filming this with their phones?

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't there be
incident reports and--

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think there
are a lot of abnormal things

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:84%
people are seeing on YouTube
and all these things.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And probably 90% of them
are fake disinformation

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
or fake alien
reproduction vehicles

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that they'll fly by just to
make people fearful or whatnot.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:90%
So, there is this happening.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand,
this doesn't happen usually

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:90%
over a major city.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:90%
These things are usually--

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
now are being shot down
in XO atmospheric areas

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and brought back and then
brought back very carefully

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:90%
to the surface here.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So, it's not always like
you shoot a jet down.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And you see it streaming
down, and kaboom.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:90%
That's very rare.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, in a
sense then, if we

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
could liken this in
some ways to a war,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
they are going to be
very meticulous about not

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
leaving any vehicles
on the battlefield.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, you will
not see any vehicles

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.615 align:middle line:90%
on the battlefield.

00:10:37.615 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, whatever
happens, they bring it in--

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's intentional.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They take a look.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So, that would then
mean, I would guess,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
that there probably is some
sort of diplomatic relationship

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:90%
with various ET groups.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And then when people
try to get in and breach

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that agreement or that
contract, if you will,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.282 align:middle line:90%
that's when problems arise?

00:11:01.282 --> 00:11:02.365 align:middle line:90%
Would you say that's true?

00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, just
like with Eisenhower.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was
some nice, good things

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:90%
happening with the meetings.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
There have been many
presidential meetings

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:90%
with certain ET civilizations.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think what happens is just
because the president shakes

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
hands with an extraterrestrial
doesn't always

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
mean that the president's
military industrial complex is

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:90%
also part of that contract.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So, we did-- our contract
is void and null now

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:90%
because of this problem.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So, if you could
again speculate,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.239 align:middle line:84%
and I understand
that this is purely

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:90%
off the top of your head.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Or maybe you
have some briefings.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're saying that
one a day on the average

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:84%
is being recovered, that
would be 365 per year.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
How many of those
per year might you

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:84%
think would be
unconventional or otherwise

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
requiring a deeper
degree of research

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:90%
for them to understand?

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, let
me get one thing.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
When I say collecting
one a day, it

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:90%
could be a piece of equipment.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be an
archaeological find.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.793 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Or it could
be something from space

00:12:13.793 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:90%
that they have collected.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be
something we shot down.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.135 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, those
are the-- when

00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I say that, that's how
much data we are getting

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:90%
in on these devices every day.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, that's why
it's growing so much

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.258 align:middle line:84%
and so much money is
going into these projects,

00:12:28.258 --> 00:12:33.410 align:middle line:84%
because it's an unlimited
amount of-- we can't keep up

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:90%
with what's happening.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So, they're starting
to store these things.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And then certain things,
certain organizations

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
are buying massive
amounts of satellites

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to track these things with
neutrino light detectors

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and forming their own ways
of getting this technology as

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
well, instead of just the
military industrial complex.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to
run something by you.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And it annoys me, OK?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So, this is a question
that I ask out

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:90%
of some degree of anger.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But it very much
upset me when I was

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
talking to my insider, Jacob,
where he was describing

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:84%
the redundancy of technology
that in some cases,

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:84%
they found so much of a
certain type of technology,

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:84%
like for example, ruins
on the planet Mars--

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
just in case we ever
get there in the future,

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
they've actually bulldozed
over ancient sites

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and buried them,
because they feel

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:90%
like they know what's there.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want it to
be so easily discovered.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.572 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard of
things like that going on?

00:13:35.572 --> 00:13:37.196 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've heard
of things like that

00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:90%
going on here on Earth.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I wouldn't
pass it by anyone else

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that that's happening
on Mars as well.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, do you think then
that the technology that they

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
have in these secret
programs is so immensely

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:57.219 align:middle line:84%
vast that in a lot of cases
they can bring things in,

00:13:57.219 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really going to
advance our knowledge that

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:90%
much?

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It will always,
usually 90% of the time,

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:90%
advance our knowledge, yes.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they bring any
type of equipment, or bodies,

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
or craft, or whatever it
is, we are still learning.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:84%
We are the medieval people
here trying to get a hammer

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and a wheel made.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So, all these little
bits and pieces all

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:90%
still fit together sometimes.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So, you might get a piece today
and a piece two years from now.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And like, here's the
two pieces, great.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
important now--

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.578 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --that a lot of the
military industrial complexes,

00:14:34.578 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and the military, and
the private organizations

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:84%
are now teaming up for
things they can't figure out,

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:84%
because they used to work
on projects for maybe five

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:84%
or 10 years without
asking for help.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.517 align:middle line:84%
It's like the husband
and wife driving around.

00:14:49.517 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And the husband is not
going to ask and stop

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
for directions whatsoever,
because we're too stubborn.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.967 align:middle line:84%
So, that's where it's at
now, but it's different.

00:14:57.967 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:90%
So, they're sharing information.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:84%
They're sharing data but very
limitly and very carefully.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It does seem to me as
if the intellectual capital,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
the, if you will, financial
and informational value

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:84%
of having more skilled
employees working on this stuff,

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
it would appear that
once we have disclosure

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and we can get a lot more,
potentially tens or hundreds

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
of millions of people more,
working on all this stuff,

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that we will quantum leap even
beyond wherever they are now

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:90%
so much.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.213 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would think.

00:15:32.213 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
There's still rules, and laws,
and regulations universally.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:84%
But as far as
technologically, we

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
will overnight transform the
world within like a week.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'll be able to 3D
Terraform houses in any place

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
50 feet above the
Amazon so you're not

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:90%
destroying the trees.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It'll be cities
will be put up everywhere.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I know even our government has
contacted me to orchestrate

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and architect a special city
here that's self-sustainable,

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that's off-grid, has
its own communications,

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
its own electric,
and all this stuff,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
because they're preparing
to do this model everywhere.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And our government
is in full support

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:90%
of that, especially POTUS.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This
doesn't make me think

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that we have any
overpopulation problem at all.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
If you have people who can
become skilled workers,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:90%
we want more of them.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:90%
We should be colonizing.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.450 align:middle line:84%
We should be going out and
developing inside moons,

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
developing inside other
planets, and on the surface

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:38.702 align:middle line:90%
of these planets.

00:16:38.702 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
get rid of people.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
We need more people.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, we will need
more people, because once

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence and all of
this information comes out,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
then everyone's going to be
really smart really quick.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So, then people will be training
immediately on this stuff.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And the secret science
behind how to do all of that

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:90%
will be revealed.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And as soon as
that's revealed, you're right.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
It'll be like taking a
flight from LA to New York,

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.569 align:middle line:84%
but to the moon or
Mars to help colonize.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be that
safe and that easy.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.634 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, I want to make
sure we get into the Vatican.

00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:14.718 align:middle line:90%
You go down this elevator.

00:17:14.718 --> 00:17:15.517 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:17:15.517 --> 00:17:17.249 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're on
an invited mission

00:17:17.249 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out what the
heck this tetrahedron thing is.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.807 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So, what do you see?

00:17:22.807 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
First, just tell me what
the elevator looked like.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Anything unusual
about the elevator?

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, it was a very large
elevator, larger than normal.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.103 align:middle line:90%
You could fit a car in it.

00:17:30.103 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Normal
elevator, very clean.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Round?

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Square?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was
square, rectangular.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.096 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So, the doors open.

00:17:40.096 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And what do you see?

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: We walk in.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:90%
The floor was white.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Walls were white.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
It was like a black rail.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A black rail where?

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.378 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There was just like
a black rail around the inside

00:17:51.378 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:90%
of the--

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
like a rail you
could hold on to.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:90%
On the walls?

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.081 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, on the
walls, about three feet up.

00:17:57.081 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was no windows,
no glass, nothing like that.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:90%
It was just a normal elevator.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:90%
It was very silent.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it
actually started moving.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was like the most
quietest elevator I've ever--

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:84%
you usually feel
the little bounce.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.444 align:middle line:90%
There was no bounce.

00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:12.943 align:middle line:84%
It was like we were
sitting actually

00:18:12.943 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:90%
just talking, whenever we got--

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and when the doors
shut, I was like,

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.220 align:middle line:84%
is someone going to push
a button or something?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:90%
I get antsy, you know?

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, like
in a minute, the doors open.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.716 align:middle line:90%
Vatican elevator's broken?

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you wearing
some kind of uniform

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.552 align:middle line:84%
or civvies at this
point, or what?

00:18:32.552 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm wearing
civvies, yeah.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, civvies, nothing special.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, you go in
after the doors open.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.295 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:18:40.295 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The first
thing I see is

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:90%
a giant auditorium-type area.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It reminded me-- and I don't
like referring to movies.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But in Harry
Potter's Hogwarts, I

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.536 align:middle line:84%
think it was like
the vault system

00:18:52.536 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
with all the little
trolls, where you look up

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and you see all
these square vaults.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:90%
But it was very rustic.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:90%
This was spotless clean.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It was beautiful
glass everywhere.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:90%
It was just like--

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.633 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, my God.

00:19:05.633 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --these huge
cubicles of glass.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.132 align:middle line:90%
And some were different sizes.

00:19:10.132 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:90%
So, it was really neat.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And through these
cubicles of glass

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
were all these metal
strips and lines.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
these platforms

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
about six feet in
diameter that could

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:90%
travel to any of these things.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was no jerky
movements to them.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
They just flowed
and then could turn.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But only on angles.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.010 align:middle line:84%
They didn't do circles
or anything to whatever.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was many people
on these things doing things

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:84%
with the vaults and looking
through them and doing things.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But I didn't get to go.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I was only on the first floor.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, this is
kind of different.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
This is why I want
you to say this

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and why I wanted to
do this right now

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is the Vatican
library, you think

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
it's like stacks of
books and bookshelves.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
This is very different.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we're
getting to that,

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
because we had to walk through
this area to get to that old--

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.081 align:middle line:84%
that other stuff you see in
the movies of books everywhere

00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:04.955 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But what you're
describing right now

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:84%
is like straight out
of a sci-fi movie.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
It must have been just
breathtakingly incredible.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was the
most amazing thing,

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:84%
one of the most amazing
things I've ever seen--

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --because
they're-- the glass too,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
they keep all this cool
equipment behind this glass.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, that's ridiculous.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Glass can break,
and earthquakes,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.814 align:middle line:90%
and whatever, explosions.

00:20:27.814 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, oh,
no, that's not glass.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:90%
That's metal.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a type of metal.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Like transparent aluminum,
maybe, something like that.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, well,
he said it's a--

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%
he did.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:90%
He just said it was a metal.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not glass.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.633 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:20:40.633 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:90%
That's all he said.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:90%
He didn't give specifics.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't there to
learn about the glass,

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:90%
even though I wanted to know.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, what
was behind the glass?

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's just be clear about that.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.441 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Many different things.

00:20:48.441 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was
equipment back there

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:90%
that I've never seen before.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Some things looked like weapons.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Something looked like
scrolls but on big plaques,

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
looked like Plexiglass,
like stacks of them.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.307 align:middle line:84%
And they all had
their own thing.

00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
There's no labeling on the
outside of these doors,

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:90%
so you know.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: None.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:90%
No numbers, no symbols.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just a gigantic six
floors of these cubicles.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Geez.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Unreal.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, cubicles there
too were as small as a foot.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:90%
And some were as big as 20 feet.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was the thing like
a hexagon or like a square?

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was all square.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK, wow.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it
was all square.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, so
as we were walking,

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:40.755 align:middle line:84%
I did notice some equipment
that looked like giant--

00:21:40.755 --> 00:21:45.396 align:middle line:84%
those Dorjes, those
ancient brass things

00:21:45.396 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:90%
that they used to hold out.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In Tibet.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, in Tibet.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I noticed they were
in the shape of that.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But they were solid,
and they were luminous.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And there was
no electrical cords

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
going to it at all.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.253 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I've always thought
that the double Dorje

00:21:59.253 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
thing is some kind of
technology that they just

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
emulated with these little
sculptures they have.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, but this was
like a really cool, artistic,

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:90%
modern, ultramodern version.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was really neat
with really cool edges on it.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was glowing.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And there was no electrical
cords in there or sockets.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:90%
It was just there.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.424 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, and you
have to understand

00:22:23.424 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there for that.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So, I can't stop-- this
is not like walking

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:90%
through the Louvre, of course.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.684 align:middle line:90%
We're on a mission.

00:22:29.684 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep
your mouth shut.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And we go where
we're going to go,

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
which we wanted to
go to the archives

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to find out about this,
this device, or the ship,

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:90%
this craft with this light.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, what
happened after you

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.812 align:middle line:84%
got through this majestic
crystalline auditorium?

00:22:45.812 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: After we
got through that,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
there was another double
doors at the bottom.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:90%
And they just slid open.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Like glass doors?

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.978 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Mm-hmm, glass doors.

00:22:52.978 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And they just slid open,
just like separated.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Any noise?

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No noise at all.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was very quiet
in there, no echoing, either,

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
which was weird
for me, because I

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:84%
thought even like a voice
would echo in this room.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And when
you saw the people

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:84%
on those moving platforms,
what were they wearing?

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were all in white,
like the surgical suits that

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:90%
are made out of that fabric.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And they had also on their
heads the normal white caps.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:90%
They're in a clean suit.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Clean room.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, but it
wasn't surgically clean.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I think whatever they were
doing, they were all holding

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
something, and
looking at something,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:90%
and looking into the glass.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.659 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, I don't know
what they were doing at all.

00:23:38.659 --> 00:23:39.949 align:middle line:90%
I have no clue.

00:23:39.949 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And do you think
that there was anything

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
beyond the first
layer of these cages?

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Was there deeper layers
beyond one layer?

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just all
on the surface?

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: On the first
floor where I was, I mean,

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:90%
it just ended.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Some were 10 feet deep.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Some were 30 feet deep.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, some were
small, like 12-inch cubes.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And some were enormous.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
We walked by one that was
at least 20 feet tall.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Amazing.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it is amazing.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, what happens after
these quiet doors open up?

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:14.905 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go next?

00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So, now we're in
the main library, I believe.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's these giant
cylindrical gas-controlled

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
tubes that are probably
anywhere from six

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:90%
to three feet in diameter.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's hundreds of them
that go up very, very high.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said six to
three feet in diameter?

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, six to three feet
in diameter, glass, or whatever

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
metal, glass, or
whatever they call it.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's windows
on them that open up.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And it goes up and down.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
thing that they hold.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And they can scroll up.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And then all those
books go down.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:84%
They're all on shelves,
all these books,

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:90%
and all these tablets.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And they go up and down.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, up
and down inside

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:84%
these cylindrical
columns, which I heard

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:84%
were vacuumed and gas-controlled
to keep them from getting old.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so, they
took us to this place

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:90%
and went to this one column.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And he just brought it right
up, all these different books

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
about this particular craft.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.207 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to get
all that information.

00:25:26.207 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What did
the books look like?

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:90%
And how old were they?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it looks like
these books were actually

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.954 align:middle line:84%
translated from another
book that someone

00:25:35.954 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:84%
wrote, because they said a lot
of this was all translated.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So, it was all perfectly written
and typed, like very new--

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.230 align:middle line:84%
just like today, like nothing
fancy at all, to be honest.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It was in binders and
folders and whatnot.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So, it wasn't fancy
or futuristic.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It was just a huge database.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But in many columns I looked
at were very old things,

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:90%
like leather-looking books.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed one
had blocks in it.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they were
blocks, but they were tablets

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:90%
with information on them.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did any of the
leather books have a color

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:90%
cover, like a bright color?

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I did
see one that had

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
many-- like one of the
columns had many colors in it,

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and many sizes too.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I saw one shelf
had six-foot books.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it
looked like books.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was far away,
maybe 30 feet away.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, when
Peterson described his trip

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
into the Vatican, he said
that a lot of the books were

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.560 align:middle line:84%
leather-bound and that they had
buckles on them and that they

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.745 align:middle line:84%
bright colors, like a
bright red, bright green--

00:26:37.745 --> 00:26:38.545 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:38.545 --> 00:26:39.345 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:39.345 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I saw that, and
it was very thick.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:84%
The leather was very thick, and
they did have metal on them.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.704 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot of that just
walking to where we had to go.

00:26:48.704 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, did you
guys get to take the book

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to a reading area,
like a table or something?

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, no,
he pulled it out.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's tables
everywhere that are

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:90%
off the ground on pedestals.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And he just laid it out on
this six-foot glass pedestal,

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was,
glass or not glass.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll just call it metal glass.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:90%
And he opened it up.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And he is the one who shows us.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:90%
We can't touch it, actually.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So, he shows like dah,
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
a translator that

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:84%
was there, because the
English was not that good.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And there was two other of their
technicians there that upkeep,

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.960 align:middle line:90%
like library bookkeepers.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So, that was really
interesting, librarians.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So, the next thing that
happened is they opened it up.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And he just started
scrolling through.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.587 align:middle line:90%
And we were looking at it.

00:27:41.587 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at it
with the two scientists.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we wanted.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
It was like exactly
what-- so, then

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
we asked him if he had anything
else that was similar to this.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So, then he took
us to another area

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:90%
and showed us another book.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And they actually had sketches
of the same exact thing--

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --that was ancient.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean, I don't
know how old it was.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was pretty
old, because it

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:84%
wasn't written on paper,
this giant sketch scroll

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:84%
that someone, some
monk, had drawn.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And it had a lot
of physics on it.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was all in a
different language.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So, we were able to get a
picture of that downloaded.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And we got a copy of that book.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And we escorted
that back to home.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you get a sense
from just what was spoken out

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:84%
loud or translated as
to what this thing was

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
or where did it come from,
anything that specific?

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, because
once I got back,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:84%
I was pulled off
of that project.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.450 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you is it
was, I think, I believe,

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
an intentional device
that was put here to help.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And then that was it.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I never had part of
that project again.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When it was in
this foreign language,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and you said it wasn't really
like a book, what was it on?

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It looked
like wax paper.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it looked like
it was black wax paper.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I think you could maybe as
you wrote on it, whatever

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:90%
that stuff was would peel off.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.080 align:middle line:90%
So, you could write on it.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
It looked like
something like that.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But I wasn't
able to touch it at all.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But it was the exact
same device, I mean,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:90%
the exact same craft.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:90%
But it was a lot larger in form.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.720 align:middle line:84%
It was probably 10 times larger
from this person's-- whoever

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:84%
sketched this, it was 10 times
larger than the one we had.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, how do
you think that idea

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:84%
that we discussed about
people starting to be

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:90%
trained as disclosure happens?

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:90%
How do you see that unfolding?

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the first
thing that's going to happen

00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:03.070 align:middle line:84%
is everyone's going to
want to know where to go.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:90%
I want to be this person.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I want to help.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to know how to grow
something overnight, a tomato.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to know
about anti-gravity,

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:90%
how I can make my car float.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So, people are going to
want to know right away.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be up to
the government what kind

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:84%
of information is
going to be released

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.750 align:middle line:84%
to the universities and
public, because they're

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.070 align:middle line:90%
going to do it correctly.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.060 align:middle line:84%
They are going to do it through
probably universities first.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, a lot
of the other scientists

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that are out there will pick
up on what they're doing.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll be
able to live stream it

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and have a source way to
get it to the public, where

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.400 align:middle line:84%
other people can just
start thinking about it,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
free-source everything

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
in order to stimulate the
entire planet into wanting

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
to do something instead of
holding it in universities

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.915 align:middle line:84%
and saying, well, you have
to learn this first, and dah,

00:31:02.915 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:90%
dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
education part will also

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:84%
be a lot easier in
learning this stuff,

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
because with the advent of all
these new technologies coming

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
out, also comes out technologies
how to learn faster,

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.497 align:middle line:84%
how to take care
of yourself better.

00:31:20.497 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these things
are daily things

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.300 align:middle line:84%
that we do are going
to be much simpler.
