[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.017 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:21.850 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:10%
we're with former US
Marine, Mike Herrera.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
distinguished service record.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:10%
Today we discuss ET crafts
and weapons systems.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.983 align:middle line:10%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE HERRERA: Thanks
Emery, appreciate that.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what have we
learned from these craft that

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.190 align:middle line:90%
are in our possession, Mike?

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, there
are a lot of research

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.047 align:middle line:84%
and development
that goes through,

00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:84%
at least from what I've
been told and briefed on

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:90%
is very extensive.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a lot
of trial and error

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:84%
because you're having different
people in these organizations,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:84%
as well as these P3s that
we've talked about, having

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to gauge and assess
how they can utilize

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the technology at least for the
understanding of the people who

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:90%
intend to operate those craft.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think, overall, it's
a learning experience

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
for everybody involved
because there's obviously

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
different methods of
incorporating that technology

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:84%
into things besides
transportation, weapons systems,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
There could be other
things that they deal with.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.227 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So are
you saying there's

00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:90%
multiple corporations involved?

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yeah,
there has to be.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: There's a lot
of hands in the cookie jar,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this
organization has

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
a monopoly on this technology
compared to everybody else.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every organization has
their own retrieval programs,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:84%
so they're going to do things
that make sense to them.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have different
ideas with the scientists

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.025 align:middle line:90%
that they're corroborating with.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are we referring
to these triangular craft

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:90%
that people have been reporting?

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Those, among
others, especially

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
similarities to the ones that
I've actually personally have

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:90%
seen, especially in 2009.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think with that
being said, you're

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
going to have different
aerospace companies that

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
produce a different
type of design,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe a different
type of system.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know any
that are specifically

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.393 align:middle line:90%
with the triangular craft?

00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Northrop Grumman.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I know they do
a lot of triangular ones.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I know Raytheon does a lot
of triangular ones, too.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what about
these pyramid-shaped craft?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.203 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about them?

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't know
if those are man-made,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:90%
to tell you the truth.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I have been told that
pyramid craft are ET.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're pretty massive
in comparison to anything

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that I understand to be,
anything that we could come up

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.715 align:middle line:84%
with would have to have
a large space in order

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
to manufacture, those especially
underground, because you think

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
about having to take
that off to the surface,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's only so many
entry points that you could

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
designate, especially, let's
say, if we're hypothetically--

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, what size are we
talking about for the audience?

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Probably
in excess of 600 feet?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I mean,
at least the ones

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:10%
that they've seen
over the Pentagon,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:10%
and there's been that
video that came out,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:10%
and that's what
they estimated to be

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:10%
was something that
was pretty massive.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's
a viable video.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.675 align:middle line:84%
They've been trying to
debunk that for years,

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:55.132 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
because it's real.

00:02:55.132 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: So we have
an episode here

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:10%
on "Deep Space,"
here at Gaia, that we

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:10%
talk about that pyramid craft.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:10%
Are you telling me that
it has not been debunked?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: To my
knowledge, it hasn't been.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason why
is because some people

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
in these organizations have
corroborated the same thing,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
saying that it's not
of terrestrial origin.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it comes
from outer space.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
think that also has

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:84%
to do with the one that was
spotted over the Kremlin

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.248 align:middle line:90%
in Russia?

00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: It's possible.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Yeah?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I know that
there's people trying

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.892 align:middle line:10%
to replicate the
technology, so there's

00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:10%
a possibility it
could be man-made,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:10%
or there's a possibility it
could be extraterrestrial.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you're not aware of
the Russians having that craft?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm not aware
of that, personally, no.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's talk about
the craft themselves.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
What type of weaponry do they
hold, that you can talk about?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't know
of them specifically, only

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to estimate it's
probably EMP weapon

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
systems that can stun vehicles.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're having to
come across conventional fighter

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:84%
jets, an F-18 per se, I mean,
you fire an EMP at them,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:84%
takes it out of the
game pretty quick,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and then you're having
to do-- a pilot having

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:90%
to do a supersonic ejection.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's very
risky for them.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.177 align:middle line:84%
So, as far as ET
craft, I've never

00:04:06.177 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:84%
been told that they've
been weaponized

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.915 align:middle line:84%
or even if they have
weapons due to--

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
if that was really the case, and
they had to defend themselves,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.767 align:middle line:90%
they could easily do it.

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In all my
service, I've never

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
heard of an Air Force
or any military jet

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:84%
getting knocked down by
an extraterrestrial craft.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Have you been informed
of anything like that?

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.405 align:middle line:84%
Any type of violent
behavior with a craft?

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Not with a craft,
but with an EMP weapon

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
systems down in the
Chihuahuan desert.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
They took down an
F-18 with that.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.132 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: That's what
the pilot had to do.

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:39.707 align:middle line:84%
It estimated at least a
supersonic ejection, so--

00:04:39.707 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's
documented, obviously.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.373 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yeah, through
this organization, it is.

00:04:43.373 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So the manuscript that I was
provided, which is-- it's

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.462 align:middle line:90%
listed as fictional.

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is how they
disclose what they've been

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.623 align:middle line:90%
doing for the last 30 years.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do
you think that is?

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.623 align:middle line:84%
Why do you-- do you know what
happened or-- what do you think?

00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So, this
team, this black team

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
was using these
containers that I saw,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:84%
but they had helicopters
that were flying them

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:84%
off to this base that was
masked in a hologram that looks

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:90%
like a mountain, but it's not.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So they had a drone
that was on standby

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that was getting observation
of this going down as well.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they had a couple
of F-18s that they scrambled.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of which was
firing relatively

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
high to get at least the
cameras on, so that way,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.762 align:middle line:84%
they can see what they're
dealing with, relay that back

00:05:22.762 --> 00:05:24.033 align:middle line:90%
to HQ or however they do that.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was
another one that was

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
intercepting the
helicopters, trying

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to get them to respond
through radio communication.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the helicopters
didn't respond to that.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They just kept flying
blind or dark, so to speak.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as they
got close enough,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that's when, in this
manuscript, they

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:84%
talked about the whole
plane just shutting down.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And it started to fall.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
just turned black,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and then the pilot had to
find the handles to eject out,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.145 align:middle line:90%
and he survived.

00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He survived?

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.093 align:middle line:90%
OK, all right.

00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: But the
technology they

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
have in order to
incorporate that, I mean,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.548 align:middle line:84%
you don't hear about that in any
kind of conventional warfare.

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially the
recent wars we've been in,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if the enemy
had EMP capabilities,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would take out
our complete air reserves

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:90%
and transportation, you name it.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would
cripple the entire--

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
anything with
airspace, I mean, you

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:90%
control it with those weapons.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And where are these
crafts located once they--

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
these triangular craft
and these pyramid craft

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:84%
or any craft that
we've obtained?

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.202 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I mean,
everybody suspects Nevada Test

00:06:27.202 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Site or Nevada Testing and
Training Range or what everybody

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:90%
calls Groom Lake.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.673 align:middle line:90%
There's suspicion that there is.

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
There's suspicion
Dugway Proving Grounds

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:84%
has reverse-engineered as
well as actual ET craft.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Some places out in the
high desert of California

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:90%
have some of them.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that for a fact
of what I've been told,

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to give the
complete location, obviously.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, of course not.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And are they bringing the P3s
out to these test sites as well,

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes,
that's what they do.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.427 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what they do.

00:06:56.427 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they use, these
P3s to summon these craft so

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that way, they can target
with these weapon systems

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and bring them down and take
their technology, of course.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the P3s
doing to connect with the craft

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:90%
and to contact it, to bring in?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.262 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:07:14.262 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I
personally don't know.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I have not been read
into how that process is.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I know with certain
groups of people,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:84%
they typically try to go
into meditation in order

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
to get to an elevated
state of consciousness.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So my theory would suggest
that these people are already

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:90%
at that level.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So they don't need to go into
a deep state of meditation

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
in order to get to that elevated
level of consciousness that's

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:90%
just how they already are.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
My assuming would
just be that they

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
have to just, put
the will out there

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.237 align:middle line:84%
and get the intention put out
there in order to connect.

00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And you did
mention that they might

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:90%
have multiple handlers, too.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:90%
At the same time.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And these people are plugged
in to machinery, too.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, really?

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: How powerful--

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So a few more
technologies involved?

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.763 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Correct,
because these operators,

00:07:56.763 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that's what they use to control
these P3s, these machines.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what these
apparatuses look like.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea about that.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that the
only way that A would

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:84%
be these operators, B would
be the psionics or P3 assets,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
C would be the advanced
tech in the ET craft.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.677 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, A can control C
through B, if that makes sense.

00:08:15.677 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Mike, could you
mention a little bit more

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
about the process, that once a
P3 vectors in one of these craft

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and the handlers are
there, do they board it?

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.465 align:middle line:90%
Do they run tests on it?

00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I assume that
that's what they do.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I was not told the
specifics on how they do it.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:84%
I just know that they
do have retrieval teams

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
present on standby that
also act as the security

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
personnel to cordon the
area off so that way,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
they have this whole testing
site under their control.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.423 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, people can't look in.

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's very
secluded areas where there's not

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:90%
going to be a lot of people.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
To my understanding,
that's how I would do it

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:90%
if I was in these programs.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as them
vectoring the craft in,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
they're going to obviously
have the P3 connecting

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to that being or that craft per
se, which if they essentially

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:84%
hijacked the craft
and take it out

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
of the control of the
being that occupies it,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
then it stuns it or pretty
much keeps it there,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
then it gives them enough time
to target it with these weapons.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Once they bring
them down, then they

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:84%
have the retrieval teams come in
and basically assess the damage,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.362 align:middle line:84%
assess if there's any living
occupants, if it's man-made,

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of course, then that's
a different story.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But if it's
extraterrestrial, they'll

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.991 align:middle line:90%
know for a fact, based off of--

00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
One instance-- I'm not going
to go very specific with it,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
but one of the
operators actually

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
was a part of the
retrieval team.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And he felt a very deep
connection with the ET,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
basically saying
that the ET felt

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
very loving towards this
very strong feeling.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was also
pain and sadness,

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and it just overwhelmed
his entire body.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So he knew for a fact that
there was a live ET present.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
As far as the specifics
go, I'm not really--

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would a P3
actually go up to the craft?

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Touch the craft?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.215 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming that once
they make contact,

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
then they probably usher these
people out of there so that way,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.123 align:middle line:84%
there's no danger
presented to these assets.

00:10:10.123 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Once it's
safe and everything's

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.983 align:middle line:84%
shut down, take them
out, then they go

00:10:13.983 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%
do whatever they have to do.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.483 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: That's my assumption.

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Just because-- I
mean, these P3 assets

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:90%
are very valuable to them.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
They can't realistically
do this without having

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
these guys present in order
to vector these craft in.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do these craft get
vectored in one at a time,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.768 align:middle line:84%
or is there a whole
flotilla of them coming?

00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm assuming
it's one at a time.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a plethora
of them coming in,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.578 align:middle line:84%
then I would assume that
they're able to target

00:10:36.578 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:84%
one of them at least and
bring him down that way.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.285 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
specifics of that.

00:10:41.285 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you heard of
more than one coming in?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, I personally
have not heard that.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
heard of, at any point,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:84%
a craft having resistance
or having backup come?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I have not heard
that either, and I don't know.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I will assume
is, if they're only

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.858 align:middle line:84%
doing this two or
three times a year,

00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and let's say, they're
doing this routinely

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
throughout the year,
that's very low odds,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.762 align:middle line:84%
if you're only getting two
or three shootdowns a year.

00:11:06.762 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, mm-hmm.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And if they're
doing it every week per se,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.767 align:middle line:84%
which I don't know how
they-- what the schedule is

00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
or how they deem it
to be appropriate,

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:84%
but there's very low
odds considering that.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you're able to
go on a global scale--

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's correct.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: --with
every installation

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.112 align:middle line:84%
that's doing the same
protocols as this,

00:11:23.112 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:84%
then you're getting
a lot of craft.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And obviously,
different organizations

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:90%
may be doing that as well.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do the P3s, when there
are extraterrestrials there,

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.005 align:middle line:84%
are they communicating directly
with them or just the craft?

00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:40.805 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Both.

00:11:40.805 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Both.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I know
that they have-- so

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
what I've been told
is they actually have

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:90%
a relationship with the ETs.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
They have rapport that
they've built with them,

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.970 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know if
over time, they get--

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, over time?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Not just when it happens?

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Right, because I know
that they do these operations

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.205 align:middle line:84%
as well when there's no
weapon systems implemented,

00:11:55.205 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and they actually just
have the P3s, I guess,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:90%
trying to build a relationship.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
over time, they

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:84%
get them to where they've
won them over and then

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.072 align:middle line:84%
get them when they're
vulnerable and not thinking

00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:90%
that things going to happen.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's--

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that
sounds like a stalker

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
who's getting warmed up to come
over for a nice dinner here.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And the ETs, they
never catch on, huh?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think
they're surprised

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
because if you have scalar
longitudinal weapons that

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:84%
are faster than
the speed of light

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and a multiples of
the speed of light,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard for
something organic,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:90%
life-form to even react to that.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost like,
if the ETs could themselves

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
predict the future
or even see into it,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
then I think that could even
be a deterrence because they

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:90%
know what's going to happen.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.005 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do
you think this is

00:12:41.005 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
working with other programs
besides the black teams?

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.062 align:middle line:84%
Is it also happening in
military programs as well?

00:12:49.062 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I would
assume it would.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's nearly
as refined as what the black

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
teams' have because they've
got protocols in place,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and they have the
assets to do that.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
conventional government actually

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
has people that are
designated like P3s in order

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:90%
to vector this.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more of
an incidental surprise.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If they happen to get a target
of opportunity at that time,

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:84%
then maybe they would
subject it to being shut down

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and then trying to
reverse-engineer it.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
But then, again, you
know as well as I do,

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:84%
conventional government
programs, they

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.323 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of oversight,
and a lot of people

00:13:17.323 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:90%
ask questions from top-down.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So the way that the black teams
have this completely covert,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
where nobody knows about it,
including the government,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I think, needless
to say, black teams

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
them more refined.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And any point have
you seen, like the government,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:84%
as I've seen, like,
there'll be a crash site.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:90%
There'll be bodies.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:90%
There'll be craft.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And the government
now just hands it off

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.183 align:middle line:90%
to probably a black team.

00:13:46.183 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't know if they
would handle it to a black team.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I think what may have
happened is that they'd get it

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
into a testing site, you know,
that military would have access

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But then, they put it
into a privatized company,

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:90%
so that way, if you're just--

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A bit lost.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly, yeah.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're a general, if you're
a senator, or congress person,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You'll never know.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: You'll
never know because you

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:90%
can't do a FOIA request.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's private.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:90%
They're very smart about that.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.103 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that's brilliant.

00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
these benevolent meetings that

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
have happened in history,
such as the White Sands

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
meeting with Eisenhower and
some of the extraterrestrials.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell us about
some of these meetings?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well,
from people that

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.845 align:middle line:84%
have been on our team that
have been there presently

00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
as high-up commanders or things
that were along with Eisenhower,

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
they stated the fact
that ETs have arranged

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that meeting with them in
order to basically say, hey,

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:84%
nuclear weapons is a no-go
or atomic at that time.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I know they started getting
into thermonuclear at that point

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.313 align:middle line:84%
because that was at
least the deepest

00:14:44.313 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
secret in the entire
world at that time.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.647 align:middle line:84%
And they kept that
thing under tight lip

00:14:47.647 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
very well, besides the whole
ET issue, which everybody's

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:90%
starting to figure that out.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:90%
But I know that--

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's very positive.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes, it is.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're trying
to warn us, right?

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you've heard of
instances like the Rendlesham--

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rendlesham Forest,
they tried to do the same.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And they-- what was
hypothesized with that

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
was, they were humans in
the future at one point.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And they came back and
said, you guys better

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
stop going on this
trajectory or growing,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.582 align:middle line:90%
and we'll cease to exist.

00:15:12.582 --> 00:15:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think, some commander
asked, well, who are you, guys?

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're
you in the future.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.808 align:middle line:90%
We're your descendants.

00:15:18.808 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So, we can take that as
a warning as we should.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, if
we're getting to a point

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
to where they intervene and
say that this is not the best

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
course you guys are
on, then maybe that

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:84%
is meant to happen in order to
steer us in the right direction.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
if we went that course,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:90%
that they would intervene?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think
they would intervene.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I believe so.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I know that Earth
is very precious to a lot

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:90%
of other races outside of this.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a kind
of a Petri dish

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:90%
of multiple different things.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And
who knows how many

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:90%
civilizations have been here?

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.935 align:middle line:84%
We only know what we can
research and look into.

00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
This earth may be
older than what

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.737 align:middle line:90%
people can estimate it to be.

00:15:55.737 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I call it the
Disneyland of the universe.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the attitude that
advanced civilizations out there

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.297 align:middle line:84%
are non-militaristic, why
would they need weapons?

00:16:06.297 --> 00:16:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't think
they need weapons at all.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I think weapons are a
byproduct of the research

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:84%
that the human race has been
doing for obvious reasons.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're at an
elevated consciousness,

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're at an
IQ of 500, 600--

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: --you really
have no differences

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:90%
to pick with anybody.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the urge
to conquer and pillage

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
the next star system per se.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
You guys are going
to work together.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.995 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of that happens

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:31.178 align:middle line:84%
because look at all
the races that people

00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
have documented over the years.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even just
our military intelligence

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
communities, it's also
throughout human history.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Look at South America, look at
Egypt, look at ancient India,

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
look at ancient China,
Japan, all of them

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.635 align:middle line:84%
list beings that look
similar but yet, different.

00:16:44.635 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they're working
in coordination with each other

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
with the respect of
understanding one another.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to us, the only
way that we understand things

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
is when we're actually
taking stuff from people.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So what
we're replicating here

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.733 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, they're
going to be worried

00:16:57.733 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:84%
about us replicating it out in
space at different star systems.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.458 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
do you think it's

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:06.063 align:middle line:84%
going to take for us to go
amongst the stars, then?

00:17:06.063 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Definitely
world peace.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
We can't be killing each
other over paper or resources

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that's native to
planet Earth, that's

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.890 align:middle line:84%
for everybody,
realistically, where you have

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
greedy corporations that
monopolize that kind of asset,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
try to make as much
money off of it,

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.640 align:middle line:84%
or somebody has a
great idea, and they

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
want to keep it secret
in the hopes of trying

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
to pocket several
hundred of millions

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.835 align:middle line:90%
of dollars for technology.

00:17:25.835 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think during
some of these meetings

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
when technology was given to
us or exchanged for something

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.572 align:middle line:84%
that we utilized that technology
in maybe a nefarious way?

00:17:37.572 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I believe
it's possible.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's actually
been a technological exchange

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:90%
for anything like that.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- if I was a being, and
I had an opportunity to give

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:84%
technology to erase that I
see blowing themselves up,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to really--

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't find that
to be very rewarding,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
let alone being somebody who
provides that technology just

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:84%
for them to weaponize it
just to kill other humans.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:90%
That's not how I would do it.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.255 align:middle line:84%
But anything is
possible at that point.

00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:84%
There could have been
technology that's

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
transferred for hands, in order
for them to understand, hey,

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:84%
this is what you could
accomplish with this technology.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's up in the
air at this point.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do we know
about the crafts that

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:90%
are in our possession?

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.585 align:middle line:90%
And what do we know--

00:18:21.585 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing here?

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Do they have an agenda?

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think the companies
that oversee those projects.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I think they have an
agenda with those.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Think about it in a
militaristic sense,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:84%
you and I both were
in the military.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
We know how that
plays into this.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
super weapon, per se,

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
or it could even
micromanage programs

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:84%
that have exotic materials,
non-human intelligence, that

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
basically convert ET
craft, and they can

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:90%
use that as a doomsday weapon.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.780 align:middle line:84%
You can put that over
the Kremlin, for example,

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
detonate a weapon over
there, and fly out of there

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:84%
so fast nobody
knows what happened.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
They're just-- especially
if it's a direct energy

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:90%
weapon, that's even worse.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- you can't
find the traces of that.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they know when
they set the P3 up where

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%
that craft is coming from?

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.165 align:middle line:90%
Who they are?

00:19:12.165 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
How many times have we already
done this with that race?

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.727 align:middle line:90%
Are they aware of any of that?

00:19:17.727 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm not
personally aware of that.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But I would assume
that if they're

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:84%
vectoring these crafts in,
it's going to be basically

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:90%
whoever's in close proximity.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%
At least for a P3 to actually--

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're not like
hunting specific species?

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.822 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, not
that I'm aware of.

00:19:31.822 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but I
don't really know that.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They could be,
for all intents and purposes,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
they could be hunting
a specific race

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.882 align:middle line:84%
because of maybe they could
be millions of years advanced

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:84%
compared to some of
the races that may be

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.882 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of thousands of years.

00:19:45.882 --> 00:19:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
certain times they

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.735 align:middle line:84%
put these P3s into activation
around planet Earth?

00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm
not aware of that.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But, from what I've
been told, it's

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
just this specific
installation that they do this

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.637 align:middle line:90%
with for the purpose--

00:19:59.637 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it like a 24/7
thing, or is it Fridays only?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.037 align:middle line:90%
Do you know any specifics?

00:20:06.037 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
It might be a target
of opportunity.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It may be when it's quiet, maybe
not a lot of people around.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does the P3
have to be above ground,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.162 align:middle line:84%
or can it be underground
or under the sea?

00:20:17.162 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't-- I
have no idea about that.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.807 align:middle line:84%
But I'm assuming
that they'd have

00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
to probably have
them topside in order

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.355 align:middle line:84%
for them to make that connection
and actually have that--

00:20:26.355 --> 00:20:27.772 align:middle line:90%
they can see each other.

00:20:27.772 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
the things, Mike,

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
have you learned
about these craft?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.188 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I do know that
the real ones are seamless.

00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:36.887 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any manufactured
sharp edges, if you will.

00:20:36.887 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything's smooth.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.378 align:middle line:90%
It's just one solid piece.

00:20:41.378 --> 00:20:45.210 align:middle line:84%
As far as the dimensions, they
can range anywhere from 50 feet

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.800 align:middle line:90%
all the way to 300, 400 feet.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:84%
There's been a rumor that
there's a 200-mile-long craft

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
floating outside of Saturn or--
yes, Saturn's rings right now.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, that was
flown into our solar system

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and is just on standby.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows what it
is or what it's for.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.198 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I heard it
might be on its way here.

00:21:02.198 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: It's possible.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And if it is,
that's what it's going to--

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It has been verified
by many organizations?

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, it has,
including this organization,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What more could you
tell us about that craft?

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I just know it's
in excess of 200 miles,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:90%
and that's pretty damn big.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that's
what I heard, right, yeah.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Moving under its own steam.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Mm-hmm,
that's what they said.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The Admiral said.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:84%
From what I have heard, that
is moving in a trajectory

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
directly in connection with
Earth at a very slow speed

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that it should be arriving
in the next six months.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard
anything like this?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I have heard that,
especially within six months.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And it ties into what we've been
trying to do with disclosure.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is also
something that we're

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:84%
they're, trying to figure
out what we're doing per se.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, if let's say,

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
because of what's going
on in the current world,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.223 align:middle line:84%
maybe if we can't get a foothold
on that, then all of a sudden,

00:21:59.223 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
do it themselves.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's get some
soft disclosure going now,

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
so we don't get caught with our
pants down when these things

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:90%
come--

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --and will
have to answer.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to
answer to a lot of things.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Well, exactly.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
in the night sky

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.398 align:middle line:84%
and see something
that's 200 miles long,

00:22:14.398 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's very massive,
I mean, that's

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
going to stick out
like a sore thumb.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
The theory is, too,
if it's this big,

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:84%
is it going to throw
any kind of forces

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.680 align:middle line:84%
against gravitational
pull, maybe

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.397 align:middle line:84%
interfere with the
earth and the moon,

00:22:26.397 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
if they get too close
to that, I mean,

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
theories because we've yet

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to see anything that big in
comparison come close to Earth.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Right, yeah,
I can only assume

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that it's under its own
gravitational density field,

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, because other things
will get pulled into that.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: That's exactly it.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I have not heard of
anyone telling where it's from

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.485 align:middle line:90%
or the species or race.

00:22:49.485 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of anything?

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I have not heard
of anything like that, either.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But I'm assuming that if you can
make an engine or something that

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is in excess of 200
miles, you have to be

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:90%
pretty advanced to do that.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, I heard there are
some teams assigned to that.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were
speculating that it's

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.238 align:middle line:84%
many races and species in a
group effort coming for peace.

00:23:10.238 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of
anything like that?

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I have not
heard anything like that,

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.812 align:middle line:84%
but if that is the
case, I hope that that's

00:23:14.812 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
what it is because that's going
to-- that's going to benefit us.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
larger understanding,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
especially coming from
peaceful initiative.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.282 align:middle line:90%
It's going to teach us so much.

00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I've said before,
the best thing that we can do

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:90%
is learn about ourselves.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we'll
have the opportunity

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to learn about ourselves from a
different perspective of beings

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that have been here a
lot longer than we have.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:84%
There's ancient civilizations
throughout the earth

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
that seems like they
vanish without a trace.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have been
enlightened enough

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:90%
to travel amongst the stars.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they've
occupied other planets.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.440 align:middle line:90%
So that could be a possibility.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And maybe these beings
know that that's happened.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just an interesting theory.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But it could pave the
way for us to have

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.530 align:middle line:84%
more enlightened knowledge
towards each other, as well,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and maybe understand that, hey,
guys, warfare, conflict, greed,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:84%
corruption, all
this kind of stuff

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is not how you're going to
elevate yourself as a species.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have
peace, understanding.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:90%
You're going to teach.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:84%
That's going to keep us
on a good trajectory.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.458 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
heard of anything

00:24:09.458 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:84%
with the black Teams being
associated with facilities,

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:90%
with the P3s on Mars?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I have
never heard that.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.282 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said, the way
that these guys have technology,

00:24:21.282 --> 00:24:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I only know based off
our Earth-based programs.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's as far as
I've been read into it.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Now, Mike,
we've heard in the media,

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:10%
and we've seen the
Tic Tac videos.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:10%
What do you think it is?

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:10%
Is this a black team situation?

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:10%
What's your opinion on this?

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I don't think
it's a black team situation.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I think this is an
aerospace company.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I know where that
Tic Tac is kept.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely in California.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
interesting location,

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
as far as the
entry points inside

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:84%
of that because there's
been some people who

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
have been on that project who
have came forward to our team.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.550 align:middle line:84%
They've talked
about the specifics.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:00.975 align:middle line:90%
They've handled it.

00:25:00.975 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
There's also been
locations on the East Coast

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:84%
where they have also housed
similar Tic-Tac-shaped UFOs

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:90%
or reverse-engineered craft.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:90%
They obviously have seams.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:90%
They have ridges.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.227 align:middle line:90%
You can tell that they have--

00:25:12.227 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:84%
there's been pictures
of some of them.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.435 align:middle line:10%
They look like they
have external tanks

00:25:15.435 --> 00:25:17.453 align:middle line:10%
on the sides of them,
piping, things like that.

00:25:17.453 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: The antennas?

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Why would
ETs need that if they

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.123 align:middle line:10%
could do that consciously?

00:25:22.123 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:10%
So that's obviously
human application.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, there's
definitely a distinguished part

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:84%
of the reverse engineer
and the seamless craft

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:84%
that are probably made
in space organically.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the theory of
materialization that

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.640 align:middle line:84%
they're-- they're at least that
they can do this into one solid

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:90%
piece.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:84%
That's how they suggest their
uniforms or their clothing

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that they wear because it
doesn't have any zippers

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.582 align:middle line:84%
or anything, that they could
actually, physically take it off

00:25:47.582 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:90%
or unbutton, like how we do.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just one solid piece.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, exactly.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've known you've
been ran into the Tic Tac.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.018 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us the
size of this craft?

00:25:57.018 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So, I know there's
different variations of the Tic

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Tac, 50 feet, 100 feet in
length, which is pretty massive,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
especially having a cylindrical
object like that floating

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:90%
through that doesn't--

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
it's not susceptible to
meet the forces of gravity

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:90%
or aerodynamics.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Like a fighter jet
would have to get

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.105 align:middle line:84%
lift, thrust, everything
to vector the proper--

00:26:16.105 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
flying in the wind like a
helicopter would have to.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's suggested
that these things actually

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
have a propulsion system
that puts a bubble around it,

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:84%
like anti-gravity field, using
very high-voltage systems

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.330 align:middle line:84%
because when I know how old the
Tic Tac has been documented,

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
it suggests that this is
probably an older system

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that they use very
high-voltage systems in order

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate that
anti-gravity effect,

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:84%
where the occupants are
not subject to the forces

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of gravity, the
forces of inertia.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were their
occupants in this one,

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:90%
or is it a type of a drone, or--

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I understand that
it's more people being occupants

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:90%
into this.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.095 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I wouldn't
rule it past these guys

00:26:54.095 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:84%
to put unmanned aerial
vehicle technologies

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:90%
into stuff like this.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.762 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Completely unmanned.

00:26:58.762 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot less risky
because you don't

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:90%
have to reel as much people in.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.410 align:middle line:90%
There's not a lot of oversight.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not subject to people
if they're not feeling well,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So if it's unmanned and
something happens to it,

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:90%
it's not really--

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
cost any human life.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
that the corporation that

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:84%
owns this Tic Tac
did this on purpose,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
or it was an accident that
they got caught on camera?

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, here's
the thing, though,

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are videotaping
anomalies every single day,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:90%
whether it's extraterrestrial.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Most of the time, it's man-made.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.155 align:middle line:84%
So I think, with them, if I was
a test pilot on something like

00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:84%
this, and all of a sudden, I saw
videos on YouTube about what I

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
was flying, I'll kind
of like, Oh, there's--

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
look what I did, you
know what I mean?

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.418 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that not that they're
going to tell everybody that,

00:27:44.418 --> 00:27:49.120 align:middle line:84%
but I would suggest that
they probably don't care.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just if you can't report
it or see that you saw this,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and there's no video
evidence of it,

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.150 align:middle line:90%
it's just spur of the moment.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
The stigma is still
strong with this subject,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:84%
so people aren't going to
be more receptive to that.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We've had prior
guests on the show, Mike,

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that talk about this safety
net, this grid that's

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, that
kind of protects us

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrials
just coming on

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:90%
in without checking in.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.082 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of
anything like this?

00:28:17.082 --> 00:28:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm not aware
of anything like that.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.052 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard that.

00:28:20.052 --> 00:28:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But what I will tell you is
that if there was a safety net,

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:90%
it's more of not from us.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.070 align:middle line:84%
There should be a safety net
for the ETs because obviously,

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
of what we've been doing
in shutting them down,

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not hearing jet airliners
getting shot down by ET craft.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if that was
something that they could do.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:84%
They certainly wouldn't do it
because it's just barbaric.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't rule
it past somebody

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to try to stage this fake alien
invasion because that would

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
be something to
trigger it if you're

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:84%
using reverse-engineer craft
to take down jet airliners.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.305 align:middle line:84%
And that would be something
that we'd probably try to do.

00:28:51.305 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.860 align:middle line:84%
What else can you share
with us, Mike, about this?

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.318 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well,
I just want people

00:28:56.318 --> 00:28:59.312 align:middle line:84%
to understand the difference
between man-made and ET craft.

00:28:59.312 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the biggest
learning curve that people

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:90%
are going to understand.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And they need to understand
the differences associated

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:90%
with each.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.842 align:middle line:84%
There's been groups that
have made contact with ETs

00:29:08.842 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that people have been
frightened by them,

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and they've kept their distance.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Then you talk about
these PLFs that

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.130 align:middle line:84%
are using those
reverse-engineered craft

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.820 align:middle line:84%
or programmed life forms that
look ET, but they're controlled.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.177 align:middle line:84%
And if those ones are not
respecting your boundaries,

00:29:23.177 --> 00:29:24.635 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, then
obviously, you'll

00:29:24.635 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
know the differences
between both.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:84%
These PLFs are aware of carrying
these heinous abductions

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and mutilations, so to speak,
of what they're seeing.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.698 align:middle line:84%
Compared to real
ETs, I don't think

00:29:33.698 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:84%
they're going to waste their
time trying to do that.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.780 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to--

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:84%
they can harvest
whatever they want just

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
through materialization because
they're so advanced compared

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.072 align:middle line:84%
to actually having to
physically grab something.

00:29:45.072 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Another way
these corporations--

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring up real quick,
do this information

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.470 align:middle line:84%
is they're really good
with the holograms now.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you could see a
seamless, AI-created craft

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.560 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's still false because--

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
what could you tell us
about these holograms?

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I
mean, I know they've

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:90%
had holograms for a long time.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how they
mask and conceal things.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.817 align:middle line:84%
It's also-- there's
been speculation

00:30:12.817 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that Phoenix Lights was
something like that.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Definitely was.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:20.115 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So that's something
that span that multiple people

00:30:20.115 --> 00:30:21.490 align:middle line:84%
throughout one
city, I mean, that

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:84%
was witnessed by thousands
of people that night in 1997.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the late '90s,
we had the F-117 coming out

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:90%
at that time, and B-2 as well.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was the most advanced
thing everybody knew about.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.797 align:middle line:84%
But if you have hologram
projection and you're

00:30:36.797 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:84%
able to stage
something like this.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:84%
There's instances
where they may have

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:84%
been able to incorporate
hologram technology

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.685 align:middle line:84%
into other things
that people may

00:30:43.685 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:90%
have thought that's been real.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:46.865 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:30:46.865 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Mike, is there one
last thing you'd like to add,

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:90%
wrapping up this episode?

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I mean,
despite the dark nature

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:84%
of these programs of using these
craft and reverse-engineering

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:84%
technologies to have
weapons-based platforms, as well

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:84%
as technologies for
militaristic purposes.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I think the benefit
is once you get

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.630 align:middle line:84%
people that have the correct
oversight on these projects,

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:09.190 align:middle line:84%
as well as people
that have good,

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.620 align:middle line:84%
kind nature in their hearts,
that could definitely

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
help us understand
more of our planet,

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.390 align:middle line:84%
maybe even alternate
sources for propulsion.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about things

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that having to tear down
ecosystems, per se, in order

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:90%
to get sustainable--

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The education part.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.365 align:middle line:90%
So I think, you know.

00:31:25.365 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
You have companies
out there that

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.600 align:middle line:84%
are taking people and
rides out into space

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:90%
to see what that's like.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we had the same
concept of teaching us,

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.130 align:middle line:84%
like, who's to say that maybe
a hundred years from now,

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:84%
you have a child that's going
to go onto a ride like this

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:84%
with an anti-gravity vehicle
that can actually go out

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
into space, and you actually
get to observe Earth

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.015 align:middle line:90%
and see what that's like.

00:31:45.015 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not
something we'll ever

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.347 align:middle line:84%
experience in our lifetime,
but maybe the future can.

00:31:49.347 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
something that would

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.013 align:middle line:84%
be pretty cool to
actually jumpstart and try

00:31:53.013 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:84%
to get this whole process
on what we're doing.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So people can learn more about
our planet and the solar system

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.822 align:middle line:84%
as well as extra
solar life, too.

00:32:00.822 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, that's a
beautiful aspect, Mike.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you brought that up.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Mike, thank
you so much for being

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:90%
on the show again.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Thank you,
Emery, I appreciate that.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
