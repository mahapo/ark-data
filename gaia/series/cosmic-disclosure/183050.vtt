[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.647 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: We're here
today with John Lear.

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking about
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.526 align:middle line:84%
John, thanks for
joining me today.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.195 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN LEAR: My pleasure, Emery.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.364 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Well, the first
time it happened to me,

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.783 align:middle line:10%
I was on our farm in
down south Florida

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.577 align:middle line:10%
there, around the age of seven.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:39.456 align:middle line:84%
And this craft
came over the lake,

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.583 align:middle line:90%
maybe 35 feet in diameter.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.419 align:middle line:84%
It was glowing a
blue white light.

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:50.801 align:middle line:84%
And I could see three beings
in a small portal, oval type

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:51.593 align:middle line:90%
of window.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.722 align:middle line:84%
And had this telepathic
very quick communication.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.434 align:middle line:84%
And it just folded in on
itself, and it was gone.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.936 align:middle line:84%
I went in and I
told my mom and dad.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.897 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK, that's OK.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.525 align:middle line:84%
Just don't talk
about it at school.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:14.199 align:middle line:84%
When was the first time that you
felt that no, we're not alone

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.952 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The first
time that I knew

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:20.497 align:middle line:84%
things weren't as they
should be was coming out

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:24.334 align:middle line:84%
of Brown and Brown Dance
School where I took tap dancing

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.712 align:middle line:90%
and ballet and tumbling.

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:29.172 align:middle line:84%
There was a bus out
there that I would

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:32.676 align:middle line:84%
get on and go to my
222 14th Street, which

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.594 align:middle line:90%
is about a 30 minute drive.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.597 align:middle line:84%
And I got on the
bus, sat in there,

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:43.729 align:middle line:84%
jostled all the way up 14th
street, all the way to Georgina

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.979 align:middle line:90%
where I got off.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And just as I got off the bus,
I was back getting on the bus.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ooh.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.864 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And I turned around
and I said to the driver,

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.657 align:middle line:90%
did I just get on this bus?

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.158 align:middle line:90%
And he had this blank look.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.118 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.788 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And here I've got to go
take that trip all over again,

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:05.334 align:middle line:84%
which is a pain in the rear
end, that 30 minute by.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And I just got on and--

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.338 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Where were you, John?

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:11.757 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: That was the first
time I realized something was--

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Something's not right.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.721 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And then
later the first time I

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:23.018 align:middle line:84%
saw a craft was in a Learjet
descending into Los Angeles.

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:27.773 align:middle line:10%
And what looked like an
M2-F2 went from left to right

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.191 align:middle line:10%
at my same altitude.

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.317 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: The bathtub one?

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:30.984 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:10%
the flying bathtub.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.986 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: The flying bathtub.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And only years later,
after I told that story

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.951 align:middle line:84%
several times, did I
realize what in the world

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:44.748 align:middle line:84%
would am M2-F2 be flying
across the Los Angeles approach

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:90%
corridor?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.833 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just couldn't happen.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.667 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And then you
knew it couldn't happen.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.668 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So it was
something else.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:52.881 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, flying all
these planes, 50 countries,

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
have you seen any other
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.806 align:middle line:84%
whether it's craft, or
lights, or anything else?

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Yeah, I was
flying from Detroit

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.063 align:middle line:84%
to Los Angeles at night,
real late at night.

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
We had just passed Chicago.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.944 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just sitting there,
nothing to do at night.

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:90%
And looked out the window.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.572 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to see out the
window. because in a cockpit

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:21.576 align:middle line:84%
usually the lights are bright
and you can't see outside

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.036 align:middle line:90%
unless you put your head up.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.248 align:middle line:84%
But my head was
close to this window.

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:28.333 align:middle line:90%
And I saw something moving.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.709 align:middle line:84%
And it couldn't
have been a star,

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.378 align:middle line:90%
could have been an airplane.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.879 align:middle line:84%
But it was moving
fairly quickly.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.509 align:middle line:84%
And then it got to a certain
position and went straight up.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.553 align:middle line:90%
I mean just boom.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.013 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's pretty interesting.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:46.726 align:middle line:84%
And then about a minute or
two later, I saw another one.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.062 align:middle line:84%
And it started coming
this way, and this way.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.189 align:middle line:84%
And then right at this
point it went boom,

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.649 align:middle line:90%
straight up like that.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.235 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
I'd love to tell

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.571 align:middle line:84%
these guys in the cockpit
who don't believe anything.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.865 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going
to happen again.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.701 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
look like an idiot.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.412 align:middle line:90%
But then it did it another time.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.705 align:middle line:90%
And I said, come here you guys.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:07.956 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you something.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.999 align:middle line:84%
And they came over and
came over, the clock wheel

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
and the flight engineer, and
watched it come across and go

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.255 align:middle line:90%
botch, like that.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.423 align:middle line:90%
And they saw it twice.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.884 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to
admit, yeah, there's

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.887 align:middle line:84%
something that's
a little odd here.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:24.306 align:middle line:84%
And then the only
other time I saw

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:27.559 align:middle line:84%
a craft was when Bob Lazar
took us out to Area 51.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.228 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So would you say
that was not our craft?

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.688 align:middle line:90%
That was their craft?

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.523 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have that
type of technology.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.693 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The first one
where it passed me, that

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:37.903 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have been our craft.

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:39.863 align:middle line:90%
It was going too fast.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.531 align:middle line:90%
At least I didn't think so.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.909 align:middle line:84%
Now the second over
Chicago, yeah, that

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:45.784 align:middle line:90%
could have been ours.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:48.455 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
reason that ET--

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
or I don't think there
could be a reason--

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.417 align:middle line:84%
for it to come along
on a flight path

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:56.922 align:middle line:84%
and just at a certain
point go straight up.

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:57.881 align:middle line:90%
That didn't make sense.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
That was some kind of
test, or something that we

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.762 align:middle line:84%
we're doing, particularly
five in a row.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:07.599 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I notice the FAA really
comes down hard on pilots that

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.435 align:middle line:90%
see these aerial phenomena.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.353 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:12.395 align:middle line:90%
Who's in control of them?

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And why do they get so--

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.148 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: A secret government.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:15.982 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --attacked?

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: A secret government.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.487 align:middle line:84%
And even if you mention
something like that,

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.865 align:middle line:84%
you're going to immediately
lose your medical certificate.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:28.453 align:middle line:84%
And you won't find a
pilot in the entire FAA

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.456 align:middle line:84%
inventory that would
ever even bring something

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:35.335 align:middle line:90%
like that up anymore.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.503 align:middle line:90%
They know better.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.838 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, a lot of people
saw those Phoenix lights.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.382 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.967 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: I'm pretty
sure that was us.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:47.097 align:middle line:10%
I had a friend that flew
for Southwest Airways.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.598 align:middle line:90%
He was on the ground.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.101 align:middle line:84%
He said, John they were
flying missing man formation.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:90%
It was not flares.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.144 align:middle line:90%
I'm familiar--

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's multiple
craft, not one large craft.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.022 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.608 align:middle line:84%
And it was a missing
man formation.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:03.947 align:middle line:84%
So it was for somebody who
had got killed or something.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.657 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say definitely us.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:09.786 align:middle line:84%
But he said, that was definitely
a missing man formation.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
And it was real.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.413 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't flares.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And the government tried
to say it was flares.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.667 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh yeah, that got
blown out of proportion.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.336 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: That was a
really important visual

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.838 align:middle line:90%
for the people in Phoenix.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, yes.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.924 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And there was
a lot of film of it.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:27.512 align:middle line:84%
And the military tried
to pass it off as flares.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.472 align:middle line:90%
Total--

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:34.728 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of any
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:40.525 align:middle line:84%
working on planet Earth, helping
any government institutions,

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:45.447 align:middle line:84%
or organizations, or
projects side by side?

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Yes, at
least five of them,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
different extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.159 align:middle line:90%
work up at Groom Lake.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.952 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.913 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And then
inside the Earth,

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:58.668 align:middle line:84%
there's at least 800 separate
civilizations that live inside.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.502 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.546 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: How can there
be that much room?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.424 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea how much
room there is in there.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.343 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well,
is the earth hollow?

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not hollow.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.015 align:middle line:84%
But they have these
huge spaces under there.

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:18.104 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: People don't know
how much volume earth is.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.022 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:22.609 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how much
water covers it too.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:26.655 align:middle line:84%
And the best place to
hide things is the ocean.

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.784 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And under these other
caverns that you talk about.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.704 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And the amazing
creatures in the ocean.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:35.497 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.956 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Fantastic creatures.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:37.791 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.669 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And I saw one,
the video the other day,

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:47.842 align:middle line:84%
of a guy who was a deep sea
diver on making the oil rigs.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:53.973 align:middle line:84%
And he made a presentation
that was very scary.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:59.854 align:middle line:84%
He saw something and it
scared the living out of him.

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:03.608 align:middle line:84%
And it was uncomfortable just
watching him tell this story

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
because it was so believable.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.031 align:middle line:84%
OK, well this one grabbed onto
the guy and tried to take him.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.449 align:middle line:90%
And he got away from it.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.534 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Whoa.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.578 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a lot of beings
also that live in the water

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.998 align:middle line:84%
out there, in the
depths, that we're

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.792 align:middle line:90%
investigating to this day.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.169 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting,
because I used to film

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.046 align:middle line:84%
for National Geographic
and Discovery Channel

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.423 align:middle line:90%
underwater film.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:31.928 align:middle line:84%
And learning every day they're
discovering a new species

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:37.142 align:middle line:90%
of seaweed, bacteria, a fish.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.019 align:middle line:84%
Just like in the Amazon they're
discovering a new species

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.355 align:middle line:84%
everyday of something
that we don't know of,

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.357 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an
insect or whatever.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.484 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a lot more discovery

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.988 align:middle line:84%
that's going to come out
that's going to be ET related

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.532 align:middle line:84%
due to genetics,
and the things that

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.869 align:middle line:84%
are coming in and out of
projects that people may

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.162 align:middle line:90%
be carrying out on their skin.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.038 align:middle line:90%
They don't even know it.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:03.126 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of mutation factors
are happening around the planet

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:07.172 align:middle line:84%
that we're noticing
through the testing of DNA.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:10.592 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: They spent 50 years
trying to prove the Loch Ness

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.135 align:middle line:90%
Monster, this or that.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.429 align:middle line:90%
Of course it's there.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.557 align:middle line:84%
But trying to prove
it is something else.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.349 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:20.852 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about these
five different ET

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:24.731 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that are
working with us at Groom Lake.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The only story I know
is the story about the security

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.401 align:middle line:90%
guard.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.654 align:middle line:84%
And they used to
hire security guards

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:36.743 align:middle line:84%
to sit at different parts of
the walkways they had built.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:40.038 align:middle line:84%
They were built out
of stainless steel.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.581 align:middle line:84%
And they'd have a
guard station there.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.333 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
he's supposed to do,

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.002 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, this one
guard is sitting there.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:90%
He'd just been hired.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And here comes a praying mantis
walking down the hallway.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.968 align:middle line:84%
And it comes walking
down the hallway,

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.429 align:middle line:84%
and the security guard looks
at him, he has a heart attack

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.223 align:middle line:90%
and dies right there.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:02.894 align:middle line:84%
And so then after that, when
they hired security guards,

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
they spent a three weeks
indoctrination period

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.067 align:middle line:84%
of showing them pictures,
but very carefully,

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.902 align:middle line:84%
and not everything
at the same time.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.154 align:middle line:90%
Give them a flash image.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.865 align:middle line:84%
And then the next time,
maybe a couple of seconds,

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.827 align:middle line:84%
to get them used to
seeing this weird stuff.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:22.205 align:middle line:84%
Because take somebody off the
street, put him on security,

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.874 align:middle line:84%
and have a praying mantis
come down the hallway,

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
shuffling along,
you know that's--

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.294 align:middle line:90%
some people would--

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.754 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's quite shocking.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.548 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Very shocking.

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.925 align:middle line:90%
So that's the only story I know.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But what were
some of the other species?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.514 align:middle line:84%
You said you know
of five, but this

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.182 align:middle line:90%
is just one story you heard of.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: I'm trying to think.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.561 align:middle line:84%
There was one that was
called the Orange, one

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.604 align:middle line:90%
that was called the Iban.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.481 align:middle line:84%
Some of them look
pretty far out.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.276 align:middle line:90%
Some of them kind of like us.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.444 align:middle line:84%
But I don't remember
exactly all of them.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:54.445 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.531 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
misconception out there

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.782 align:middle line:90%
with these Greys.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:01.953 align:middle line:84%
What could you
tell me about that?

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: They're made
on Zeta Reticuli.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.622 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.457 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And they are
cybernetic organisms.

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially
glorified robots.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.547 align:middle line:84%
And anybody can use them,
good ETs, bad ETs, whatever.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:16.593 align:middle line:84%
They're just there to do a job,
whatever they're asked to do.

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:21.139 align:middle line:84%
The story about Serpo
is completely not true.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.224 align:middle line:84%
Serpo is the story
that's been going around

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:27.812 align:middle line:84%
about the contingent of Air
Force and Navy personnel

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:31.858 align:middle line:84%
that went to Zeta
Reticuli and learned

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:37.113 align:middle line:84%
how to play soccer with them,
and all kinds of nonsense.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.157 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nonsense, yeah.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.534 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: When I first heard
that I couldn't believe it.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.702 align:middle line:90%
And people really thought--

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.664 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: People believe we
hit golf balls on the moon.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:51.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But the story I
heard 30 years ago or so

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:84%
was there were three
people, three guys that

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.636 align:middle line:84%
went to Zeta Reticuli and
stayed a couple weeks.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And when they came back one
had died, one had gone crazy,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.519 align:middle line:90%
and one was completely normal.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.981 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the first time
I heard of anything similar

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.066 align:middle line:90%
to Serpo.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:13.942 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Hmm.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:20.114 align:middle line:84%
That makes actual sense
to me if it did happen.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Because small groups
of people over time--

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.792 align:middle line:84%
Russia did a study on this,
actually, with five cosmonauts.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.795 align:middle line:84%
And locked them up for
just like 150 days.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:90%
And three of them lost it.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.132 align:middle line:84%
And only two really
kind of kept their wits.

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:40.009 align:middle line:84%
And that was only
after 150 days.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:45.056 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a very strong mental
mind to do anything like that.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.642 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting you said
that they were a little whacked

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.936 align:middle line:90%
out when they came back.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:53.606 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But the
Serpo playing soccer

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.191 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely ridiculous.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.443 align:middle line:84%
Bit I can see the
government point of view

00:12:57.443 --> 00:13:00.863 align:middle line:84%
where they're wanting to
present them that they were not

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:01.864 align:middle line:90%
that threatening.

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:02.865 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:06.744 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's get back to
the program lifeforms,

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
these greys that can
be operated by pretty

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:90%
much any extraterrestrial race.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.379 align:middle line:84%
I have heard that we
have duplicated this.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:20.258 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen human-type
cybernetic organisms

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:23.845 align:middle line:84%
in the projects where I could
not tell they were not human.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:28.391 align:middle line:84%
I was privy to a huge
group of scientists

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.811 align:middle line:84%
at the university in Mexico,
where they put 300 people

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.021 align:middle line:90%
in the auditorium.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.065 align:middle line:84%
And it was secured
by the military

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.817 align:middle line:90%
so no one would be there.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:42.113 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists
came up on front stage

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.658 align:middle line:84%
and basically showed
a PowerPoint of this

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.453 align:middle line:84%
is where we're
going with robotics.

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:52.832 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're going with
osseointegration, the formation

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.834 align:middle line:90%
of tissue into titanium.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.171 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're going
to grow an organism,

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.007 align:middle line:90%
but also add circuitry to it.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:05.553 align:middle line:90%
It was too unfathomable in 1993.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:09.265 align:middle line:84%
So he said, well everyone,
just to let you know

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.392 align:middle line:90%
this has already been done.

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:15.104 align:middle line:84%
And three of you in the
audience are these bots.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.064 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Mm.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.857 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And everyone went nuts.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.233 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:22.695 align:middle line:84%
And they said, they asked
them to please stand up.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.907 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, I
think, shocking thing

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.867 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of those
scientists to have

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:32.038 align:middle line:84%
seen this that are a
part of that project,

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.831 align:middle line:90%
that we already did it.

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:38.044 align:middle line:84%
Because they were already
working on it to see who

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:90%
would come up with.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.549 align:middle line:84%
But we-- they've already done
it like five years before.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:44.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:46.677 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I think
they got this from

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:51.265 align:middle line:84%
the reverse-engineered
technology of a couple of craft

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.975 align:middle line:90%
that have crashed that--

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.311 align:middle line:84%
of course, they send PLFs
when they come to crash,

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.563 align:middle line:90%
to help share.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.357 align:middle line:84%
They intentionally
sometimes crash here

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:00.775 align:middle line:90%
to give us a little--

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.902 align:middle line:84%
some goodies, so we
can advance ourselves.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:03.736 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.196 align:middle line:90%
Roswell was that.

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:07.031 align:middle line:90%
Now they actually did crash.

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.243 align:middle line:84%
But when they were
going to clean it up

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.786 align:middle line:84%
they were told no,
leave it there.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.704 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see what
they can do with this.

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:16.791 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe they
are helping humanity kind

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.794 align:middle line:90%
of get to where it needs to be?

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.088 align:middle line:84%
I know they're not
allowed to do too much.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.966 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone's
always asking well,

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.385 align:middle line:84%
why don't they just go to
land on the White House lawn

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.846 align:middle line:84%
and give us all
their technology?

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.431 align:middle line:84%
And we both know it
doesn't work that way.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:37.145 align:middle line:84%
We've got to work hard here to
get ourselves correct first.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:37.979 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:42.066 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we can clean up this
planet and clean ourselves up.

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:44.485 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Yeah, this planet
will never be cleaned up.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:45.361 align:middle line:90%
It'll always be here.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:90%
It'll always be a prison planet.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.866 align:middle line:84%
It's for those
guys that need help

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.785 align:middle line:84%
in learning how to live with
integrity, without envy, hate,

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:56.205 align:middle line:84%
or greed, and to express their
love to their families each

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:56.998 align:middle line:90%
and every day.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.333 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
trying to learn now.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:02.336 align:middle line:84%
The help we're getting is
strictly for the government

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:08.926 align:middle line:84%
itself as a bribe to not let us
know what they know about ET,

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:11.095 align:middle line:90%
and that we were made by ET.

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:14.515 align:middle line:84%
They want to be sure that
they have the government's

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:84%
complicity and agreement
to work towards this end,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.314 align:middle line:90%
and not make any disclosure.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:25.234 align:middle line:84%
Not that they would have anyway,
but that's the agreement.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:28.654 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You did mention
just to bring it up,

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.949 align:middle line:90%
as Earth as a prison, I'll say.

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And that makes me think
about the new prison

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.957 align:middle line:84%
that they have worked on
for agents and for people

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:42.835 align:middle line:84%
who have broke the
rules in the projects.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.504 align:middle line:90%
Do you know about this prison?

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:49.592 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Yeah, they took the
people that violated their oath

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.594 align:middle line:84%
or did something that
they weren't supposed

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to do as a security guard, or
as a worker there at Groom Lake.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.226 align:middle line:84%
And if they were
going to go to prison,

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:01.812 align:middle line:84%
they sent them to Lovelock,
which was a federal prison.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:03.522 align:middle line:84%
But after a few
years they realized

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
the problem in doing that is
the prisoners from the test site

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.031 align:middle line:84%
would tell the other
prisoners about the aliens,

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.575 align:middle line:84%
and the underground
facilities, and all that.

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:16.077 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't want that.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So they ended up building a
prison inside the Nevada test

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.123 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was a supermax.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.752 align:middle line:84%
And the supermax, of
course, is the new prison

00:17:25.752 --> 00:17:27.964 align:middle line:84%
we built throughout
the United States

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:30.216 align:middle line:84%
to hold the toughest
of all prisoners.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.176 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
call it supermax.

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:35.721 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever heard
of a super soldier type

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
program where they were
mixing extraterrestrial DNA

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.646 align:middle line:84%
with humans and
experimenting with that?

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:47.942 align:middle line:84%
Or just anything with
that type of program?

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:48.734 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:52.738 align:middle line:84%
Those super soldiers have
been showing up in the UK.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:57.368 align:middle line:84%
And I assume they're building
them in Saudi Arabia.

00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:58.744 align:middle line:90%
But I really don't know.

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.204 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I think so too.

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:01.789 align:middle line:90%
And what about Pine Gap?

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.166 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing over there?

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.669 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Pine Gap has been
there for a long time.

00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:13.384 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- it's
UFO, ET Related.

00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:16.887 align:middle line:84%
I do know that there was
a story where somebody

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:21.726 align:middle line:84%
had seen in a building
a small ET talking,

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:25.271 align:middle line:84%
one that was 3 feet tall
talking with our scientist.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.897 align:middle line:84%
But other than that
it's very difficult

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.482 align:middle line:90%
to get any information.

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:29.859 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now the
tribes out there

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.444 align:middle line:90%
seem to know a lot about it.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
recently contacted

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.825 align:middle line:84%
by one of the tribal leaders
that really want to help out

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:41.912 align:middle line:84%
in some way to fund a
self-sustainable community

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.999 align:middle line:84%
with the help of
extraterrestrials.

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:46.709 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.919 align:middle line:84%
You know, Pine Gap has
been there a long time.

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:50.713 align:middle line:84%
But what people
generally don't know

00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:56.135 align:middle line:84%
is the US has 13 major
bases in Australia.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:19:00.056 align:middle line:84%
And about 10 years ago, there
was a big uproar about that.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.308 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
kind of died out.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:07.146 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot going on
there that we don't know about.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:14.236 align:middle line:84%
And as I told you the anti-grav
program that used to be at S4

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.989 align:middle line:84%
has been all
transferred to Woomera.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Woomera is in South
Central Australia.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.954 align:middle line:84%
And it was the site
of the Australian nuke

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:26.165 align:middle line:90%
test back in the '50s.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of underground
facilities in area there.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.838 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
there now except--

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.673 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
moved in there,

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:38.052 align:middle line:84%
is because we have our
anti-grav research there.

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:40.805 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
that the countries that

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.306 align:middle line:84%
are working with
extraterrestrials,

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.891 align:middle line:90%
are they doing it independently?

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:47.061 align:middle line:84%
Are they sharing the
information back and forth?

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.562 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: I don't think we share.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:52.149 align:middle line:84%
And I base that on the fact
that when Bob worked at S-4,

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:55.403 align:middle line:84%
the Russians had been
invited in to look

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:57.113 align:middle line:90%
at some of our research.

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, had
immediately been kicked out

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and not allowed to know
whatever it was we learned.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.331 align:middle line:84%
So if we were sharing
it's not going on anymore.

00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:08.749 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do
you think that is,

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:11.085 align:middle line:84%
John, that we're not
sharing back and forth.

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:12.503 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: I think
that sharing would

00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:16.173 align:middle line:84%
bring us too close to the
secret US Navy space command.

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.049 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, right.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.467 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And if we
started sharing?

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.886 align:middle line:84%
Information there,
the space command

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:24.557 align:middle line:90%
would show up as part of this.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.226 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think they
want to leak that at all.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.937 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you think
about this new space program?

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:30.729 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:34.442 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we already know it's
already been there forever.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But now it's coming out
because they need money,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.114 align:middle line:84%
and they have to show
where money's going.

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:41.866 align:middle line:84%
What's your take on
this space program?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.451 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know,
six months ago there

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:48.497 align:middle line:84%
was 33 of us that were asked
to put on paper what we would

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:49.957 align:middle line:90%
like President Trump to know.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:50.749 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.334 align:middle line:90%
And it was published on the web.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:53.836 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple
months after that,

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.672 align:middle line:84%
we were given six
minutes of video

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:59.133 align:middle line:84%
to tell President Trump
what was going on.

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.344 align:middle line:84%
My part, and the
reason they asked me,

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.805 align:middle line:84%
was my knowledge of
9/11 and the aircrafts

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:07.141 align:middle line:90%
that were part of 9/11.

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:10.019 align:middle line:84%
Whatever became of
it I don't know.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But when President Trump
announced the space command,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.983 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering what
is the deal here?

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:18.152 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
try and phase that

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:20.863 align:middle line:84%
into the space
command that exists?

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:21.697 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:25.701 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Or the Navy has never
been known to share anything.

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:28.829 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
whether President Trump

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:30.873 align:middle line:90%
knows what's really going on.

00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:32.708 align:middle line:84%
And there, as I
told you, he doesn't

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.294 align:middle line:84%
have a high enough
clearance to know that.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:40.174 align:middle line:84%
And he's surrounded by
the dual passport holders,

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:42.843 align:middle line:84%
Israeli-American
passport holders trying

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:45.179 align:middle line:84%
to limit the information
that gets to him.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:47.139 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, or the
information he's getting

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:51.018 align:middle line:84%
is just too much
or disinformation.

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.437 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've been approached
by a lot of people coming up

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:55.981 align:middle line:84%
to me, talking about
the Tall Whites

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.984 align:middle line:84%
from Nellis Air Force
Base that Charles Hall has

00:21:58.984 --> 00:21:59.902 align:middle line:90%
been reporting.

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.028 align:middle line:90%
What is that all about?

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.947 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: That Charles
Hall set of three books

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:06.534 align:middle line:84%
was the most interesting
books I've read in a long time

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:10.287 align:middle line:84%
because he had everything
accurate as far as where

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:13.832 align:middle line:84%
that base was, and
the Tall Whites.

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:17.586 align:middle line:84%
Except he made it sound like
that base was to the south.

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:20.881 align:middle line:84%
And the real name
was Indian Springs.

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And now it's called
Creech Air Force Base.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.677 align:middle line:90%
That's where he was based at.

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:29.265 align:middle line:84%
And all the stories he told
matched with all the dry lakes

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.724 align:middle line:90%
and area he had to patrol.

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:32.643 align:middle line:90%
He was the only guy out there.

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:34.895 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
the Tall Whites,

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:40.067 align:middle line:84%
their base that we
helped build was 13 miles

00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:42.778 align:middle line:90%
Northwest of Dog Bone Lake.

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And that matches with
the maps that I have.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.578 align:middle line:84%
So that would be almost halfway
between Groom Lake and Dog Bone

00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:51.579 align:middle line:90%
Lake.

00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:56.041 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I have a friend,
Bill Worsline that I've

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.835 align:middle line:90%
known for 35, 40 years.

00:22:57.835 --> 00:23:00.921 align:middle line:84%
And we do all kinds of
investigation together.

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:02.339 align:middle line:90%
I know him very well.

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:06.093 align:middle line:84%
And one day, about 20
years ago, he says call me.

00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:08.095 align:middle line:84%
And said I'm going up
to the black mailbox

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:09.471 align:middle line:90%
to see what I can see.

00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:13.267 align:middle line:84%
So we all know the black mailbox
is on the Medellin ranch there.

00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where people hang
out to look at Groom Lake.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.273 align:middle line:84%
I said, well call me if
there's anything weird.

00:23:19.273 --> 00:23:20.649 align:middle line:90%
So he called me.

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:24.194 align:middle line:90%
He drove up Monday morning.

00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:27.615 align:middle line:84%
And Monday evening
he parked his truck

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:31.535 align:middle line:84%
at the black mailbox oriented
towards the southeast.

00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:84%
He and his wife
were sitting there.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:36.248 align:middle line:84%
It was dark, 8:00,
9:00 at night.

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:39.335 align:middle line:84%
And he sees two
headlights coming his way

00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
from way, way in the
distance to the southeast.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.132 align:middle line:84%
And they come faster,
and faster, and faster.

00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:46.759 align:middle line:90%
And pretty soon they go--

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:50.095 align:middle line:84%
as it gets closer to his
truck, he opens the door

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.055 align:middle line:90%
and puts his--

00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:54.892 align:middle line:84%
gets out to stand there to
watch this thing go over.

00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:57.895 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I didn't
actually see it go over.

00:23:57.895 --> 00:24:02.358 align:middle line:84%
But I turned to the right and
here's an 18 Wheeler grinding

00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:04.443 align:middle line:90%
up that road towards Rachel.

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:07.404 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
blinking red tail lights.

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:10.532 align:middle line:84%
So he said something's
not right here.

00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:14.787 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK,
well, when you get,

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:90%
you want to do a regression?

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.748 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK.

00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:20.668 align:middle line:84%
Though I was almost licensed
as a geographic regressive

00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:21.669 align:middle line:90%
hypnosis.

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:24.254 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't take the final
exam because I didn't have time.

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:27.633 align:middle line:84%
But anyway I know how to do
it, how not to get in trouble.

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:30.177 align:middle line:84%
So he came by the
house with his wife.

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:33.472 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a big long couch
there that faced the fireplace.

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.932 align:middle line:90%
He laid down.

00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:38.394 align:middle line:84%
I didn't set up a
recorder because I

00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:40.646 align:middle line:84%
had no confidence that
anything was going to come out.

00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:42.022 align:middle line:90%
This town's like a BS--

00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:43.315 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.109 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Even though I
know Bill very well,

00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:47.736 align:middle line:84%
I know he wasn't
fabricating anything.

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:52.449 align:middle line:84%
So I start the regressive
analysis and immediately

00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:53.617 align:middle line:90%
the story comes out.

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:57.871 align:middle line:84%
And the story is as those
headlights came to his truck

00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:00.916 align:middle line:84%
it was actually a
flying saucer or disk.

00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.961 align:middle line:84%
And it had parked right over
his truck, about 50 feet.

00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:07.506 align:middle line:84%
And he felt himself being
lifted, levitated up

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:08.882 align:middle line:90%
to and through the doorway.

00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:09.925 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:13.387 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And then this
saucer, the regular maybe 35,

00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.305 align:middle line:90%
40 feet in diameter inside.

00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:16.598 align:middle line:90%
And there was a nice couch.

00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:23.147 align:middle line:84%
And the Tall White motioned to
him to lie down in the couch.

00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:27.317 align:middle line:84%
So the Tall White says,
what do you need, Bill?

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:30.487 align:middle line:84%
And Bill's absolutely
speechless.

00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:31.697 align:middle line:90%
What do I need?

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:32.489 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:34.283 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here, he says.

00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:35.743 align:middle line:84%
Well you're the
one that called us.

00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:38.954 align:middle line:84%
You're the one that was
looking towards our area.

00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:40.831 align:middle line:90%
And you wanted to see us.

00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:43.417 align:middle line:84%
And so Bill is
absolutely speechless.

00:25:43.417 --> 00:25:44.877 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's
what I was doing.

00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:48.005 align:middle line:84%
But the Tall White introduced
himself as Quaylor,

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:53.802 align:middle line:84%
Q-U-A-Y-L-O-R. And they
just started a normal chat.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:55.512 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:58.557 align:middle line:84%
The various questions, you
know, how many are there?

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:02.227 align:middle line:84%
And you know the different
types of questions.

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:07.441 align:middle line:84%
After about 30 minutes Quaylor
says OK, Bill, it's time to go.

00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:08.942 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get back.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:11.445 align:middle line:84%
So Bill gets up out of
the couch, walks over

00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:12.237 align:middle line:90%
to the doorway.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:15.783 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking out, and the
truck is 50 feet down there.

00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.743 align:middle line:90%
And he looks back at Quaylor.

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:19.286 align:middle line:90%
And Quaylor says, no problem.

00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:20.078 align:middle line:90%
Just step out.

00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:21.872 align:middle line:90%
You'll be OK.

00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So he steps out and
he just gently floats

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:30.631 align:middle line:84%
down to his truck, and ends
up in the exact same position

00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:34.092 align:middle line:84%
that he last remembers watching
these lights come towards him.

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:36.428 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Coming out of the
door out of the truck, there.

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Yeah, that
was the story.

00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:40.682 align:middle line:84%
And neither one of us,
we were both surprised

00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:42.142 align:middle line:90%
that the story came out.

00:26:42.142 --> 00:26:44.645 align:middle line:84%
Because Bill and I
are used to hearing

00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:47.105 align:middle line:84%
other people's stories,
regressing other people,

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.023 align:middle line:90%
not between ourselves.

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:49.107 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now it's
happening to you.

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:50.859 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So it was
really amazing.

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.612 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Worsline
was the lead guy

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:57.574 align:middle line:84%
for finding the box after
Cherry Hinkle said--

00:26:57.574 --> 00:27:00.077 align:middle line:90%
after the eight months went by--

00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:00.869 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:02.246 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: --were the two meetings.

00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Dulcy
security guard said

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.084 align:middle line:84%
if I miss two meetings
that means I'm caught.

00:27:07.084 --> 00:27:09.294 align:middle line:84%
So you can go look for
the box, go get the box,

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:11.505 align:middle line:84%
and show everybody
what's in there.

00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:15.092 align:middle line:84%
So after two months, Cherry
called Bill Worsline.

00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:18.679 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Worsline led
the hunt for the box.

00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:22.057 align:middle line:84%
And I think they had three
separate complete hunts lasting

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:25.435 align:middle line:84%
two or three days each one,
and never found a trace of it.

00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:29.648 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he give any
descriptions of the beings?

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:34.236 align:middle line:84%
Were they fat, were they
ectomorphic, mesomorphic?

00:27:34.236 --> 00:27:36.071 align:middle line:90%
What was their body somatotypes?

00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:36.947 align:middle line:90%
Were they skinny?

00:27:36.947 --> 00:27:38.282 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: We didn't go into that--

00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:38.866 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Didn't go into that.

00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: --Emory.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.034 align:middle line:90%
Just what we call a Tall White.

00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:42.119 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, tall white.

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.453 align:middle line:90%
Sure, sure.

00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:44.997 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And this
was the exact one

00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:90%
that Charles Hall wrote about.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.459 align:middle line:90%
And everything matched up.

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:51.044 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Matched up with that.

00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:52.921 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm not too familiar
with Charles Hall.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:56.508 align:middle line:84%
So give me the
back story on him.

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: He was stationed
at Indian springs.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.847 align:middle line:90%
And he was a weather observer.

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:05.809 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, he was one
of only maybe one or two people

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:06.935 align:middle line:90%
that were stationed there.

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:10.564 align:middle line:90%
It's an extremely desolate area.

00:28:10.564 --> 00:28:12.232 align:middle line:84%
where you're just
taking the readings.

00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:14.192 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Indian
Springs in those days,

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:16.278 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing there either.

00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:22.576 align:middle line:84%
So he used to drive maybe 10
miles east of Indian Springs

00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:23.994 align:middle line:90%
and then north.

00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:27.956 align:middle line:84%
And north you meet up with Dog
Bone lake and a few others.

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:30.042 align:middle line:90%
But he described it exactly.

00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:31.877 align:middle line:90%
And everything matched up.

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:33.754 align:middle line:90%
But one day he's out there.

00:28:33.754 --> 00:28:36.089 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
the exact scene.

00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:41.887 align:middle line:84%
But he saw some wispy
figures in the distance.

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:45.557 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't figure out
exactly what was going on.

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:49.937 align:middle line:84%
And then he saw another smaller
wispy figure down caught

00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:54.024 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, like in bushes or--

00:28:54.024 --> 00:28:55.776 align:middle line:90%
not able to move.

00:28:55.776 --> 00:28:59.863 align:middle line:84%
And he went there and
helped that figure out.

00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:02.157 align:middle line:90%
Turned out to be a small White.

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:06.078 align:middle line:84%
And the mother apparently
was so thankful

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:08.789 align:middle line:84%
that they became
friends, and told Hall

00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:11.708 align:middle line:84%
that they were building
a base to the north.

00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:14.753 align:middle line:84%
And they got to friends
and he saw them from time

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:16.588 align:middle line:90%
to time up there.

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:19.049 align:middle line:84%
And he just described
the base of being

00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:24.388 align:middle line:84%
13 miles to the Northwest
of Dog Bone which

00:29:24.388 --> 00:29:29.559 align:middle line:84%
would be exactly halfway between
Groom Lake and Dog Bone Lake.

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:32.729 align:middle line:84%
And that happened to
be the exact place

00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that when Bill Worsline line was
up there at the black mailbox

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.194 align:middle line:84%
where he was facing,
they were coming from.

00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:42.406 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were they speaking
English or telepathy?

00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Telepathy.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.241 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, telepathy.

00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:46.994 align:middle line:84%
So who is in control
of this planet?

00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:48.912 align:middle line:90%
It's obviously not us.

00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:52.541 align:middle line:84%
You know there's some
other outsiders looking in.

00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:54.126 align:middle line:84%
And what could you
tell us about that?

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:56.086 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: OK, you're
going to get an opinion.

00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no way
I could really know.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.007 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I understand.

00:30:00.007 --> 00:30:01.591 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The people
that made us, when

00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:03.927 align:middle line:90%
we're born we're given a soul.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:08.223 align:middle line:84%
The soul is one of the most
fantastic things ever devised.

00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:10.058 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:14.021 align:middle line:84%
It has a capacity for
so much information.

00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:18.025 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
educated and matured

00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:19.443 align:middle line:90%
from the day we are born.

00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:23.613 align:middle line:84%
So all of us here, you, me, all
of us have lived at least 200

00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:27.617 align:middle line:84%
or 300 lifetimes
before we got here.

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:31.163 align:middle line:84%
The reason we're here is
because after our last time

00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:36.877 align:middle line:84%
it was apparent that we were
not candidates to go ahead

00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:39.588 align:middle line:84%
unless we learned
more about how to live

00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:44.051 align:middle line:84%
our lives with integrity,
without envy, without hate,

00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:47.679 align:middle line:84%
without greed, and to express
our love to our families

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.222 align:middle line:90%
each and every day.

00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:51.349 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
doing here on Earth.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:53.518 align:middle line:84%
And Earth is not
the only planet.

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:56.271 align:middle line:84%
There are billions
of Earths just

00:30:56.271 --> 00:30:59.441 align:middle line:84%
like this one that have
the same people trying

00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:01.401 align:middle line:84%
to learn the same
things, learning

00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.153 align:middle line:90%
how to live with integrity.

00:31:03.153 --> 00:31:06.698 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible there
could be another John Lear

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:10.243 align:middle line:84%
energy, or soul, on
another planet right now?

00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:11.411 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Probably a billion.

00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:13.497 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or another
dimension, possibly?

00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:14.331 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:31:14.331 --> 00:31:16.958 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, because we're
everywhere all the time.

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:20.629 align:middle line:84%
And we're working
multiple places.

00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:24.341 align:middle line:84%
That's what I believe in,
multiple planetary systems.

00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:25.217 align:middle line:90%
Well thank you, John.

00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:26.676 align:middle line:90%
That was interesting.

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:31.014 align:middle line:84%
As always a pleasure to talk
to someone of like mind.

00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:32.724 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming on the show.

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: My pleasure, Emery.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you again.

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:38.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Says his name is
Dr. Allen J. Hynek.

00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:41.316 align:middle line:84%
Weren't you with a thing
called Project Blue Book?

00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:42.984 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought they
shut it all down.

00:31:42.984 --> 00:31:45.612 align:middle line:84%
He says, yeah, they got you
thinking, right, don't they?

00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:48.323 align:middle line:90%
>> We went inside this craft.

00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:50.575 align:middle line:84%
There was a soldier
standing right here.

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.662 align:middle line:84%
Then there all of a sudden, I
see like a flash and look over.

00:31:53.662 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:90%
And he's not there no more.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.833 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know his
name or nothing.

00:31:57.833 --> 00:32:01.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever physically been
to a planet other than Earth?

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:02.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:05.924 align:middle line:84%
>> From my perspective, Mr.
Kramer does believe that he is

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.467 align:middle line:90%
telling the truth.

00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:10.595 align:middle line:84%
>> A frisbee came in, plowed
into these palm trees.

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.472 align:middle line:90%
It's a disk.

00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:16.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Area 51 is doing the
advanced aircraft program.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.938 align:middle line:84%
>> All the military branches
have covert military space

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.523 align:middle line:90%
program operations.

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.108 align:middle line:84%
>> They shut down
Project Blue Book,

00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:26.528 align:middle line:84%
but you're now here
searching underwater UFOs.

00:32:26.528 --> 00:32:28.405 align:middle line:90%
>> At Fort Gordon, Georgia.

00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:30.782 align:middle line:84%
I slipped one of the pieces
of debris in my boot.

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:34.244 align:middle line:84%
>> We would engage in
ground combat with groups

00:32:34.244 --> 00:32:36.454 align:middle line:90%
of indigenous reptoids.
