>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by Victoria
Whitney, a Doctor of Science

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:10%
and a retired member of the
United States Navy, Department

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:10%
of Defense.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:10%
She has worked as an
environmental engineer

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:10%
and scientist in special
programs and projects

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:10%
and is an expert in the
extraterrestrial and crash site

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:10%
investigations.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Today we're discussing
the Arcturians.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA WHITNEY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.818 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you describe
the Arcturians solar system

00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:44.825 align:middle line:84%
and the different stages of the
development of their planets?

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We have to describe how
they got there first.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
They are a species that
migrated to that system,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
so they have a lot of
different lineages.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And as they began to
settle in and learn

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
about their new environment
because they are spacefaring

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
beings, they
determined that they

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
needed to go as far as they
could go to other systems.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Like Pleiadians and Orions,
they have a very spiritual way

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of looking at things.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, people have said, oh,
you can't trust Arcturians.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
any other species.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You have those that are
good and those that are bad.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And so for the most part, what
I've met of the Arcturians,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
they happen to be
very spiritual.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They are very dedicated
to the work that they do.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be willing to
work with us and to teach us.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
really need when

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:90%
we get into that environment.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
They have a very
developed system

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
like most of the other
Pleiadians, Orions.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
They have more of
a communal system

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:90%
rather than a familial system.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
They definitely
share everything that

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:90%
happens within their community.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Their support system
is that no one being

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:90%
is left to their own devices.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
emotions, though.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.828 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much
stay away from that.

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
They're, again, like most of
them, because they're spiritual,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
they have a centered
awareness, very heart-centric.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They do have fabulous memories,
the photographic memory,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
They recall details to us that
even though we took pictures,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
we didn't remember
those details.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet they can just really
recall them in great detail.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.622 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought
that was fascinating.

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Out of all of them,
I'm sure that's

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.163 align:middle line:84%
part of what they contribute
to the science group,

00:02:40.163 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to
recall so many details.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
they're very tall beings,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
just like most of them they're
somewhere in that 9 to 10

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:90%
foot range.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
They're very slender,
although not as slender

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
as the Orions are.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Their arms and legs seem
to be more in proportion

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:90%
with their height.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:90%
They're very dark blue color.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have crystals
embedded in their skulls,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
group they belong to.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:10%
We had Koh Ni Dah.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:10%
He was in our group.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:10%
He gave himself an Earth
name called Cat Stevens.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
When I asked him why, and he
said, have you heard that music?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So based on whatever he saw
on that and liked in it,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
he thought that was a good
name for him Of all of them,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:90%
he had a sense of humor.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:90%
He understood sense of humor.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were still
learning what that meant.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
He was very friendly,
very soft spoken.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they're telepathic.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So when he's in the
group, you don't

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:90%
hear any verbal conversation.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
He's just communicating
with them telepathically.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:90%
He's done that with me.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:90%
But he also likes to be verbal.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.795 align:middle line:84%
He's fascinated with the sounds
that come out of our mouths.

00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
was interesting

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that he would choose to be
more verbal of the group.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is their
voices soft or harsh?

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: He has
a very soft voice.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I never heard any
change in tone that

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
would be considered
a more negative tone.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I always heard
more of a positive,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
a lilting tone out of him,
very soft spoken, though.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
pay attention.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Because their hearing is so
acute, everything they do

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:90%
tends to be in a quieter mode.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:90%
The difference when they move--

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
when we walk, our arms go in
gait with the rest of our body.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
His arms tended to go
together with his body,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not sure if
that has something

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to do with their shoulder
structure or not.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
They have very thin
shoulders, so maybe they

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
don't have a ball
socket like we have.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I never saw him lift
his hands over his head,

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
so I can't say that
that's what's happening.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to be that
everything he articulated

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:90%
in front of him is done--

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
they have very large
hands, very long fingers.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to be
articulated that way, more so

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:90%
than movement of the arms.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:90%
They take very long strides.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time
keeping up, so I

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:84%
have to take two strides
for every one of his.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And he seemed to be the
most social of the group.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me that that
has to do with the lineage

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:90%
that he comes from.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.420 align:middle line:90%
They're more social.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't know if that's--

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Lineages do different
jobs, like specific lineage

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that for some reason this
lineage loves to be medical.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:90%
This one likes to be security.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they do
believe in a lot of healing.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
That's their forte, is
the ability to heal.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And he says his lineage
is great healers.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure that
probably has something

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
to do with it, although they
have a lot of technology

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:90%
that they are into.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:84%
You can ask 100 questions, and
you'll never know the real them.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I tried to get to the bottom
of their social structures

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.195 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's
important to build on.

00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a concept
of brothers and sisters,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I asked him about reproduction.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And he just smiled at me.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to
get an answer there.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that they
probably use a pod system

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
based on some other references
that he made along the way.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
He does talk about having to
have his body renewed just

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:90%
like the rest of them.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So the cellular
structure breaks down

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
based on the
gravity and our sun.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:90%
He did not like our sun.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:90%
He said it was too harsh.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
where they come from,

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:90%
their sun is not that harsh.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Probably of all of
them, he was more

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:90%
touching than the rest of them.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Most of them pretty much
would not touch another.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
But occasionally,
if he wanted to make

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
a point to me or something,
he would touch me on the arm.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was unusual
for them to do that.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So I never felt
threatened by them.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I always felt very
comfortable with them.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:90%
He had a lot to contribute.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And he would always
say, well, you know.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I said, no, that's
why you're telling me.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.638 align:middle line:84%
But he would try to
contribute to whatever

00:07:12.638 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
it was they were working
on so that I would

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:90%
have an understanding of it.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
We talked a lot of
science because,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:90%
of course, that's their forte.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't understand
something, which I'm not

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
going to understand a lot
of their technologies,

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.797 align:middle line:84%
then he would take
the time to try

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:30.885 align:middle line:84%
to give me enough information
that I could understand.

00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:31.685 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:33.332 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why was he
so much different

00:07:33.332 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
than the other Arcturians
that you worked with?

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Because he seemed a
lot more open with you.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: He says because
they're an older race

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and that they've been around
other beings a lot longer

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and that they've adapted to
that, which I found interesting

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:84%
because most of them say
we're millions of years old.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
So how much older is that?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I did notice that he was
quicker at making adaptations

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of them.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that's
because his understanding

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
of what was going on
allowed him to adapt faster.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
He seemed to be on that scale of
being able to accomplish things

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:90%
at a much faster rate.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.945 align:middle line:84%
We've had many discussions
on perception and energy.

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating to see how he
looks at it because they all

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
have the same theory that
everything is energy.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But he will expound on
what that really means.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He'll say to me, you
don't understand,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:90%
it isn't just energy.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:90%
It's more than energy.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
And then he'll go into
talking about the intelligence

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:90%
of the energy.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
really fascinating that he

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:90%
was willing to share that.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What makes their
society one of the most advanced

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.332 align:middle line:90%
races out there?

00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, I think
it has to do with age.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because they've
been around the longest.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.653 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, they've
been around longer.

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%
I think that they've--

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
he says they've been
all over the universe.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
They've been all
over the dimensions.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:84%
They're very good travelers
of interdimensional spaces.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why, is
that they've seen more.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
desensitizing.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
it is, is that they're

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
desensitized to a lot of the
things that they've seen.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.325 align:middle line:84%
They've become
accustomed to them

00:09:10.325 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and accept them
for what they are.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.788 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they bring it
forward into their culture.

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's
something beneficial,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't you do that?

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, so I think
that's what they've done.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.166 align:middle line:84%
They're just much older
and have had more exposure.

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
dimensional travel.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:84%
What more could you
tell us about this?

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they say that
they do it easily and often.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I did ask them, I said,
does that include time travel?

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
They do expound on that
by saying that they're not

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
allowed to change anything
in time because it

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:90%
creates a new timeline.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about the
fact that we, too, could

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.848 align:middle line:90%
be interdimensional travelers.

00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have an
understanding of it right now,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:90%
that's why it eludes us.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as we get
that understanding,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:90%
we'll be able to do that too.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.442 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
have anything to do

00:09:59.442 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:90%
scientifically with our making?

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they
will tell you that they

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
don't do any DNA manipulation
because they believe in source.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
They believe that source
created the species that

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to be
here, and that if you

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
toy with something
that's perfect, then

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:90%
you're running afoul of source.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.652 align:middle line:84%
So they don't do
any manipulation.

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was an interesting way

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to look at it because they
keep using the word perfection.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the
Arcturians best known for?

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
probably their healing.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:84%
They have systems and
systems of healing.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
When they were here,
I broke my back.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were more
than willing to give me

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:90%
a good healing for that.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And since that's happened, it
hasn't been bothering me at all,

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
whereas before, to
stand up straight

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
would have been
really challenging.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, yes,
they understand how

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:90%
the energies work to do that.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of healing.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I have a good understanding
of healing with energy

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
but not the same way
in which they do.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And they say that it's
not a manipulation

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:90%
or a channeling of the healing.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.788 align:middle line:84%
They say it's a placement
of the energy in its space.

00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:12.413 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was an interesting--

00:11:12.413 --> 00:11:12.826 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That interesting.

00:11:12.826 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, right.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And within space.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, right.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so for them,
it's a natural thing.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.665 align:middle line:84%
We just need to have
more understanding of it.

00:11:23.665 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think eventually
one day we'll all have that.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: I think so, too.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.525 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think it's
a matter of time.

00:11:28.525 --> 00:11:30.175 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Just believe.

00:11:30.175 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what other
things besides healing?

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they
do say that they've

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
played a role in providing a
means with which to resolve

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:90%
conflict between other beings.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
a product of wars.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
They admit that in
their ancient history,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:90%
they did a lot of warring.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And they say we've
evolved from that.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think when they
look back at everything

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that happened in their past that
caused them to migrate and have

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to go to other planets
and start over again,

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I think they found a
resolution to that.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So now what they're trying to
do is supply that resolution.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
why we want to have war.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They say, you're on
such a small ball.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet if you
explain it to them,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:84%
you say, well, it's just we
don't have the same belief

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:90%
And they don't understand that.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:84%
We should all have the same
belief system according to them.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
what they try to do

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
is provide a means with
which to understand that.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.548 align:middle line:84%
And if that comes down
to teaching a being,

00:12:33.548 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
then that's what
they're going to do.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.465 align:middle line:84%
But they have
played a large part

00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:84%
in that they say that we've
averted wars because they've

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
stepped in and found a
better means with which

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:90%
to resolve that.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Now what that is, I don't know.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that there was
a trade-off or something

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
because that seems to be
the way they do things,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
is by trading system.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:90%
So did they provide--

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.262 align:middle line:84%
if we decide not
to go to conflict,

00:12:59.262 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%
they will trade us something.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.085 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
probably what happened.

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I can see
what you said earlier

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:90%
about this planet.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:90%
We're so small.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Why is everyone warring?

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Because of all the
different belief systems.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are many different
kinds of human races

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And on other planets,
you could probably

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
attest to this, that
they're probably

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:90%
all of that one race in that.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they
go back to lineage.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Lineage is so important.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:30.082 align:middle line:84%
But what they say is that
we're still the same race.

00:13:30.082 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we say
if you go to our website,

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
we tell you, on this planet, we
are one race, the human race.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:90%
We need to get to that point.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
They reached it long
before we did, obviously.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:84%
They understood how
important that was.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.037 align:middle line:84%
And so we now need to
understand the same thing,

00:13:47.037 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that it's very
important to be humans.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.135 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, we have to
get on that trajectory.

00:13:50.135 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is their
involvement with the humans

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth?

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.425 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: You
ever get that time

00:13:56.425 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
when you feel like something's
whispering in your ear?

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what they try to do,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:84%
is send us messages and
thoughts and try to point us

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to
directly confront you and say,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:90%
this is where you should be.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
What they do is it's a
matter of suggestions.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:90%
They transfer that energy to us.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I love when somebody says,
oh, I had an epiphany.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.623 align:middle line:84%
And my thought now goes to,
I bet it was an Arcturian.

00:14:25.623 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what they're doing,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is they're trying to send those
energetic messages to us to say,

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
look, you have to find a better
way to deal with each other.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And you need to learn how
important each of you are.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.065 align:middle line:90%
We just don't go there.

00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:84%
We just have these walls
built up amongst each other.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And we just don't want
to break them down.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
very much the fact

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to give
that at that energetic level

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
so that we internally get
the message because obviously

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that'll change our
heart in some way

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.647 align:middle line:84%
eventually if you
hear it enough times.

00:14:59.647 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's what
they're trying to do,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
is subtly come to us that
way because they're not

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:90%
supposed to intervene.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get
around that loophole?

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's nothing that says
that you can't telepathically

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.232 align:middle line:90%
send a message.

00:15:15.232 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's a lot of
what they're trying to do.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So compared to other
United Galactic Federation

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.510 align:middle line:84%
members, what role do they
play in within the structure?

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, from the
sense that I've gotten,

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:90%
they are active members.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
different scientists

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:90%
that work in the conclaves.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And they have other
types of conclaves.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just the
science conclave.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But they do have active members
that contribute to that.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get the
impression that they

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.182 align:middle line:90%
want to take a governing role.

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that if they
come in contact with somebody,

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
they're willing to contribute
to whatever that is.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I think they think of themselves
more as teachers, so to speak.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And so from my
experience with them,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
it seems like every moment
is an opportunity to teach.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are
they helping humans

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.715 align:middle line:90%
get to this fifth dimension?

00:16:10.715 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, we've
had many conversations

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:90%
about higher consciousness.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they don't call
it higher consciousness.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same thing.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:90%
We put a label on it.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:90%
For them.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a given that that is
just a state of your being.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:90%
And then you become that.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the
classes that I teach now

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
are on state of being and
becoming because we don't

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:90%
have that type of concept here.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to consciousness,

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.525 align:middle line:84%
they believe that we
really need to work harder

00:16:42.525 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to make people have
higher consciousness that

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:90%
raises their frequency.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And really ultimately,
what they want us to do

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is get to super
consciousness because that's

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:90%
the keys to the universe.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And they say that if you want
to become part of those greater

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.340 align:middle line:84%
cosmic communities, you need
to be able to understand

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:90%
at that level.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.946 align:middle line:84%
And so we should be striving
to get to super consciousness.

00:17:03.946 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
other specific traits

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that the Arcturians
have that are in

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
common with other
extraterrestrials?

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yes,
besides spirituality.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Besides spirituality.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: The one
thing that we noted--

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and they allowed us to do some
testing for-- is that they all

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.225 align:middle line:90%
have enhanced eyesight.

00:17:20.225 --> 00:17:22.754 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.754 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
We compare that at a 20/20,
which they find funny

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
because in their way of
thinking, we're fairly blind.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I'm about
to say, the funny thing

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:90%
is we're a bunch of blind bats.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: So they have very--

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:90%
we did some tests.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
We would put markers
at distances.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And we were using 100
yards as our distancing.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
500 yards was easy.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly, 700
yards was just as easy.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So we realized that they
have very acute eyesight,

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
same with their hearing, all of
them have very acute hearing,

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:57.725 align:middle line:90%
unlike us.

00:17:57.725 --> 00:18:00.392 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned to me off
camera that the Arcturians have

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:03.042 align:middle line:90%
a second skin for their--

00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:84%
could you tell us
a little bit more

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:90%
about how that technology works?

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.565 align:middle line:84%
So like the Pleiadians
and the Orions,

00:18:09.565 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
they have to worry about
cellular breakdown because

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.220 align:middle line:84%
of the gravity here
and because of our sun.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so their uniform
that they wear

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
like a second skin,
the difference

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is that theirs includes
their footwear.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it controls
the environment around them,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.890 align:middle line:84%
gives them relief
from the gravity.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.298 align:middle line:90%
I can't even envision.

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
explain to somebody

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
how the gravity
is affecting them.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.853 align:middle line:84%
But until you
actually feel it, I

00:18:36.853 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:84%
don't think you would
really understand.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's a real
concern for them,

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.070 align:middle line:84%
is that their cellular body's
being affected by the gravity.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So these suits are designed
to help counter that.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
about theirs is that--

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:90%
he likes to work at night.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And this thing has a
bioluminescence about it.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was really fascinating

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:84%
because he's the only one that
I saw that his suit did that.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying that
maybe the Orions don't.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:07.930 align:middle line:90%
I never saw it.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But his has a
bioluminescence about it.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I would hear him humming
in this bioluminescence.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And when he would hit certain
frequencies in the humming,

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
it would brighten
up, or it would dim.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
responding to it.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So it's
responding to his body.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was just fascinating

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:90%
that that would happen.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.525 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the Arcturian
collective consciousness?

00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: All right.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:90%
So this is an interesting idea.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's simplify it.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a hive mentality,
so to speak.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they collectively

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:90%
belong to a thought process.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So all of them know
what's going on.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no secrets from the
time that they are children

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
into their elderly years.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And they have long lifespans, I
believe that their lifespan is

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:90%
almost 2,000 years.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:90%
So they really share everything.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And we would look at
something and somebody

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:90%
would say they have an idea.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, they all have the
idea, which is different.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.632 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants to be
the author of the idea,

00:20:25.632 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in other
words, because it's

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:90%
a shared collective.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And everybody
benefits from that.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
happens if you disagree.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's a foreign
concept to them.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.975 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing.

00:20:40.975 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
If an idea is born, it's
for the benefit of all.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
way they pursue it.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:84%
That collective
consciousness, like I

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
say, the thing I could
equate it to is that hive.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:90%
What do bees do?

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Is to serve the
entire family unit.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.325 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
their consciousness is,

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
is to serve that
entire family unit.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's great.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.747 align:middle line:84%
Are there any significant
practices or ceremonies

00:21:07.747 --> 00:21:09.705 align:middle line:84%
that you can tell us
about with the Arcturians?

00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They talk about a ritual
that towards the end of life

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that they do because
like most of them,

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
they're collecting knowledge.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they do this big
ritual where everybody

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:90%
is host to the knowledge.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they say that it's a
great, joyful time, that all

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
the energies are
flowing and everybody

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:90%
shares in those energies.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge becomes
expanded to everybody.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about this
collective cloning ceremony

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:90%
that you mentioned.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They have a
collective cloning ceremony

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:90%
where--

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:90%
and so it's really--

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
cloning is a funny
word with them.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do they use?

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: In each,
in Pleiadians, Orions,

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and Arcturians, I
asked about cloning

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
because it does sound like
that's what they're doing.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So for the Arcturians, though,
it is very much a cloning.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
They start with an original
DNA pattern, so to speak.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to
their original lineage

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
instead of taking something
that has been generated

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:90%
over hundreds of generations.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like making a copy
of a copy of a copy.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
They go back to that
original lineage.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And they clone off
of that original DNA.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're
saying is that they

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.180 align:middle line:90%
have a pure lineage at hand.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they
stayed with that.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.302 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And they
stayed with that.

00:22:36.302 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
different than the Pleiadians

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:90%
and the Orions in that way.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
ceremonial thing for them.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.435 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
making sure that--

00:22:47.435 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:90%
so they have multiple moons.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
bringing the moons.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.777 align:middle line:84%
They have to be in
alignment in order--

00:22:54.777 --> 00:22:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: For that to work.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.277 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: --for
it to be working.

00:22:57.277 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:90%
So I thought that was just--

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a wonderful
way to look at life.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what
other unique things

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that you've learned from the
Arcturians with communication?

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, one of the
original things they have is

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
what they call light
communication, which

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:90%
is interesting.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We're used to frequencies or
verbal communication, things

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.115 align:middle line:84%
But this is a light
language that they speak.

00:23:23.115 --> 00:23:24.115 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Light language.

00:23:24.115 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: A light language.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:25.935 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I like that.

00:23:25.935 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: And very unusual.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
He spent a lot of time
trying to teach me.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I think I need to have
more of a knowledge base

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:84%
before I would learn
how to do that.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But this is a way in which
they communicate when

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:90%
they're not with other beings.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.036 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's entirely
within their community.

00:23:47.036 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
They call it a more soulful
way of communicating because it

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:90%
deals with their spirit level.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And it is energy to energy
instead of vehicle to vehicle,

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
was very fascinating

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:84%
because he would practice it
on one of the others, Pleiadian

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:90%
or Orion.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.572 align:middle line:84%
And they would not
respond in that way.

00:24:14.572 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because they
don't-- they may have a light

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.947 align:middle line:90%
language of their own.

00:24:17.947 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
same as this one.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
fascinating to watch.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And I could actually
see as he did it,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
he began to glow differently.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I would see these auras
about him and very touching

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:90%
way to communicate.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because it
is harmonic still.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But I know photons and
light are frequency too.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What I was trying
to get across to the audience

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is that verbalization of that
light language is the light.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, it's the
transfer of the light.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And in harmonics.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And so
like I say, it's

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
very much that more
spirit to spirit

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:90%
rather than vehicle to vehicle.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It goes just so much deeper.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful sounding.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It is.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Like I say,
I would love to do it.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.398 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's another
step above Sanskrit

00:25:11.398 --> 00:25:12.690 align:middle line:90%
when you're doing your mantras.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:90%
It's just so pretty.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And
according to Koh Ni Dah,

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:84%
this is the real way in which
they touch their source.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.568 align:middle line:90%
And it is light to light.

00:25:23.568 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Its connection, right?

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I got it.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.600 align:middle line:84%
What is the most thing
you value about Arcturians

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.830 align:middle line:90%
that you can tell us?

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.465 align:middle line:84%
What's their most outstanding
quality you would say?

00:25:34.465 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
what's interesting is

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
we want to make connections.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And while the
Pleiadian are there

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're communicating with
us and they're including us,

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I never felt that there
was a direct connection,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:90%
same with the Orions.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I never felt that there
was a direct connection.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They're more than
happy to speak with us

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and include us in
what they're doing

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.062 align:middle line:90%
and different things like that.

00:25:58.062 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But I never felt that
real direct connection.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
With the Arcturians, I felt
that direct connection.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I felt them
touch my spirit.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's such an
unusual feeling.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you can't be
elated when something happens

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:84%
like that, because it takes
you to the next level of what

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:90%
it really means to be alive.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
the one thing that I

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.986 align:middle line:84%
appreciated about them, is that
they were willing to share that.

00:26:23.986 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I can't see us going
someplace to another being

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
understand and saying,

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.595 align:middle line:84%
here, let me make this
direct connection with you.

00:26:32.595 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:90%
We're more cautious than that.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So I appreciated
the fact that he

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
was willing to make
that connection

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and to share that
essence of himself

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
so that I could have
an understanding.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And that took time.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: It did.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it didn't
happen the first year.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
We were well into
the second year

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:84%
before he decided that
he could trust, I guess.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
comes down to trust.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
which he felt that we

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.552 align:middle line:90%
could make that connection.

00:27:02.552 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Victoria,
do you ever feel

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
like a child around
these beings?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're so advanced.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And you're learning every
day something from them.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:90%
They're learning from you too.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: In the beginning
when we first met them, I mean,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.948 align:middle line:90%
they sought us out.

00:27:15.948 --> 00:27:17.240 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the other way around.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
They walked in and said, I
followed the gold light to you.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.844 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to help us.

00:27:22.844 --> 00:27:25.697 align:middle line:84%
Now, when somebody walks
up, and at that point,

00:27:25.697 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
we thought they were
homeless because that's

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.392 align:middle line:90%
what they looked like.

00:27:29.392 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And we help homeless
people all the time,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
so this wasn't anything
out of the ordinary.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But once they revealed
why they were there

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
expecting from us-- so

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
when we started off, the
Andromedans very much

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:90%
acted superior.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And I only got one-word
answers out of them.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what's
wrong with this picture?

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.598 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to learn
anything if they're not

00:27:48.598 --> 00:27:49.702 align:middle line:90%
going to contribute?

00:27:49.702 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:10%
But at some point, Zendor,
who was the commander,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:10%
went and talked to them.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:10%
And then when they came
back the next time,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:10%
they seemed to be
contributing in a conversation

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:10%
and everything.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I think I had to
earn that trust.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I think I had to earn
that I could understand.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And we got into a lot of
scientific discussions.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to carry my
side of the load with it.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think that eventually
they said, oh, wait a minute.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We might be able to move forward
with a better relationship.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't right off the bat
that everything was copacetic

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:90%
and we're all pals.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:90%
I had to earn that.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And they've had experiences with
very intelligent people here

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that still they would have
treated them the same way.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
They would have made
you earn the right

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:90%
to be within their working unit.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually,
we got to that point.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thankful that we did.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But I hear people that are
experiencers all the time.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't get a
chance to experience it

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:84%
from that point of view
because usually it's

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:90%
different circumstances.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm hoping is that
as they get to know us more--

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping we get to
work with them again--

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.275 align:middle line:84%
that they will learn that
we're capable of that,

00:29:12.275 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can move forward,
that we can learn

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:84%
what unconditional love is and
we can give it just as well,

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and that they'll be able
to talk to us at that level

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and include us as part
of their community.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.225 align:middle line:90%
So that's my hope for us.

00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what Omnicron
Commonwealth is about,

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:84%
is uniting people
together and saying, look,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:84%
there's a bigger
community out there.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:90%
We need to become part of it.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.608 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You're doing it.

00:29:34.608 --> 00:29:35.525 align:middle line:90%

00:29:35.525 --> 00:29:37.031 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what do you see
their role being played out

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:90%
in an open contact scenario?

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.855 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, I
think they're cautious.

00:29:45.855 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They got the brakes on.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.352 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They've
got the brakes on.

00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:52.060 align:middle line:84%
They've had some instances where
they've talked about they've not

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.102 align:middle line:90%
had good contacts before.

00:29:53.102 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it because we're
not at a conscious level

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.870 align:middle line:90%
yet for that to happen?

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.982 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:29:56.982 --> 00:29:58.107 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a lot of it.

00:29:58.107 --> 00:30:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people
tend to panic over

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:90%
things they don't understand.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we become
panicked, we do things.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
We react in ways that we
probably shouldn't do.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.685 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they've
experienced a lot of that.

00:30:12.685 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
They've talked about people
taking shots at them.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I would
recall an instance where

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:90%
that would be a necessity.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's because people
don't understand.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And they get scared.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And that they've taken
a more cautious way

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:90%
of introducing themselves.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:84%
They look for people
like I said when

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.220 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the
navigator showing us

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the hologram with a
map and everything.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.335 align:middle line:84%
If you come across
as a gold energy,

00:30:41.335 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
it means that you're a
high enough frequency.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they're more than willing
to interface with that being.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:52.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're down there, there's
a lot of blue on that map.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're saying,
is that these individuals

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:90%
are not awake.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't see themselves
dropping in and knocking

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
on the door and saying, hey,
we'd like to communicate.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
really important, is

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.653 align:middle line:90%
that they are being cautious.

00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.334 align:middle line:84%
In the greater cosmos,
we're considered barbarians.

00:31:10.334 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, we are.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't earn that lightly.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
knowing that, they're

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
taking a more cautious
approach to getting to know us.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
think they believe

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.515 align:middle line:84%
we could actually do more harm
if we went amongst the stars?

00:31:27.515 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I think that
they believe that we don't

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:90%
have controls on our emotions.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they believe
that we would react more

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.190 align:middle line:90%
negatively than positively.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.453 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I could see that.

00:31:40.453 --> 00:31:41.495 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it right now.

00:31:41.495 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
that they think we

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.780 align:middle line:84%
need to learn how to control
that first before we really

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:84%
jump into the primary
of a community.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, we got
a lot of work to do.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:90%

me such great questions
