00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are talking about our human

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:10%
origins with Peruvian researcher
and author Ricardo Gonzalez who

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:10%
has had multiple contacts with
extraterrestrial species called

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
the Apunians.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So these beings have
given you information about

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:84%
the history of Earth
and our human origins.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.617 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Through all these
years of contact,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
they've provided extraordinary
information about our origins.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:84%
It's quite complex
to cover at all.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It speaks about very, very
complex universal events

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
way before the existence
of human life on Earth

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and how these
events have actually

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
come to affect
humanity, including

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
the intervention of ET groups
in our evolutionary process.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
There have always been
patterns of life on Earth.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:84%
They helped or accelerated
the evolution of mankind.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:84%
In a very remote
time, they would

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
have coexisted with ancient
civilizations that were human.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they agreed to
go because they recognized

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that their presence was actually
causing more problems than it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:90%
was helping.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, they
opted for a protocol

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
that was observational
rather than direct.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> For how many years have
they been visiting us, Ricardo?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> From the beginning,
they have been visiting us.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
from the beginning,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying before the
humans were here on Earth.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
They designated the Earth as
a good place to seed life.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible that they
were here from before the moment

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:90%
when life could be cultivated.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>> At what time did the
Apunians seed the Earth?

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
>> The Apunians, as I call
this group of ETs that are

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
in contact with us, they
gave me this information.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But they were not the
ones who participated

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
in that ancient
period of humanity.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It was other ET civilizations
that seeded life on Earth.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know what other
civilizations helped with that?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It was actually a team
of different groups of ETs.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:10%
But according to
what I've been told,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:10%
the scientists that were in
charge of life on this planet

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:10%
were involved with two
other civilizations--

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:10%
one from very, very
long ago in a place

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:10%
that we humans call the
constellation of Cygnus.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:10%
And there is
another civilization

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.033 align:middle line:10%
that is linked to the
constellation of Pleiades.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
According to what
they've told us,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
they combined their
efforts to accelerate

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
the chemical processes of the
planet to harvest a pattern

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
of life when the
conditions were right.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And when the natural evolution
was able to take off,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
it allowed for them to emerge
the first ancient species

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:90%
of mankind.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they human?

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Was it a human?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Are we descendants
of other humans?

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a natural process
of evolution on the Earth.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
According to the ETs,
they accelerated it.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:90%
They assisted it.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And while nature was already
walking its own path,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
it was being helped
by ET technology.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
This caused different types of
species to come upon the Earth,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
including the first humans,
the primitive humans.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you aware of a
species on planet Earth before

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%
the primitive humans came?

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Did they have animals,
bacteria, plankton?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Did it start there?

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The evolution of humankind
began with a harvest that had

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.027 align:middle line:84%
different characteristics,
just like if a gardener planted

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
a garden with all the
plants that he had collected

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:90%
throughout his life.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So the human being
is a flower that

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:84%
surged from that new garden
and was assisted in developing

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:90%
into what is now Homo sapiens.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But before this occurred, other
species that were stronger

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
had developed and began
to dominate the world.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So within this multipattern of
seeds that was left on Earth,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
there was a reptile
species that also

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
surged in our world that is not
originally from this planet.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It was part of a seed
that had been brought

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:90%
from another part of the space.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking about the
origin of dinosaurs.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Their rise altered
the ETs' experiment.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They did not expect them to
have such a large development.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Then the surge of these types
of reptile species on Earth

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
put the future of man at
risk because these reptiles

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%
would continue to evolve.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
They were a strong
and dominant species.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
They would not have given humans
the space to be able to thrive.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Strategically, a
decision had to be made.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
One of them was to just
abandon the project

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
because it was clear that
the humans could not survive.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And the second option
was to clear the road,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
to extinguish the species that
was making things difficult.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So 65 million years
ago on Earth, there

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
was an impact of a supposed
asteroid in the Yucatan

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Peninsula that extinguished
the species that we

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:90%
call the dinosaurs.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:90%
It was not an accident.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It was provoked.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
The ones that did it wanted
it to look like an accident

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
because there was a military
operation on Earth that

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
alerted other ET
civilizations who may not have

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:90%
been in agreement with this.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
This would explain why
ET civilizations that

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
have a reptile
humanoid evolution

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
look negatively upon our
placement in the universe.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It is curious that various
scientific studies have been

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:90%
conducted by paleontologists.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
They make projections
using computers.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
What would have happened if
some of these reptile species

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
of dinosaurs had
not been wiped out?

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
They would have in
time transformed

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
into humanoid species that
would have walked on two feet.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And their appearance according
to this computer program

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
would not be that
different from the accounts

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:84%
of what a lot of people talk
about reptilian species.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But having said
this, there's still

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot of folklore and
confusion around these accounts

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
where issues of conspiracies
get mixed up, including

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that these reptilians have
ways of taking human form

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and that are actually the
presidents of certain countries

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, I do consider
that to be an exaggeration.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fact that
some of the politicians

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
do act like reptiles does not
mean that they literally are.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe there
are civilizations before

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
the dinosaur age
here on planet Earth?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there are a lot
of different civilizations that

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
were involved in our history.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to study
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos deeper and link
it to the period of dinosaurs,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:84%
we have to look to where
the seed of life comes from.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And that according
to the ETs is Orion.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:10%
These were the stars that
our ancestors signaled

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:10%
to the most with their
stories and legends

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:10%
or with the very
pyramids in Egypt.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe in
reptilian extraterrestrials?

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Parting a bit from the
account that I just explained

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
regarding the dinosaurs as
well as the type of scientific

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
developments relating to them,
it's not crazy to think that

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
in other parts of the universe,
there were other entities that

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:90%
evolved from reptiles.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I think a problem
that exists in ufology

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
is we tend to negatively judge
the intentions of nonhuman

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
entities based on
their appearance.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Some will assume that if
they are tall and blond

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and look like Nordics, they
are messengers of peace.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But if they look different
from our standards of beauty,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:84%
like a creature that has
the appearance of an insect

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
or a reptile, we
automatically assume

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:84%
them to be hostile because
of their appearance.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to clear up something
because my opinion is

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that it's about how they
conduct themselves with us.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the information
and the message

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
that tells us who they really
are and not their appearance.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that is a program
here on the planet that people

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
have been manipulated,
of course,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:84%
by the media in the last 100
years here on a fear-facting

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:90%
agenda.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you thought for
a moment, if we stopped

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:84%
looking at someone,
and we were blind,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.850 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know even
what they were wearing

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
or what they looked like
but could feel their energy

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and could use telepathy
without judgment,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
imagine the communication
between the worlds

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and even in our
planet how all of us

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
would get along so much
better because there's

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
nothing there to feel but the
true essence of that being?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I agree with that.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
is a common point

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
in this journey of
seeking that is not

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:90%
based on the superficial.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It's actually something very
intimate and buried within us.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Human beings-- we're in the
middle of a great situation.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle
of a cosmic story that

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:90%
appears to be fantasy.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And even though it
sounds controversial,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
there really isn't such
a thing as good or bad.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's really our
human perception.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just different
perspectives that

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is based on their own
survival, their progress.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they
follow different protocols

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
that differ from our
morals and practices.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that are considered

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:90%
chaos in the universe.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not all positive.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And some actions
have made slaves

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
of other civilized
communities in the cosmos.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that
there have been wars.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And those wars have had
consequences here on Earth.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
just physical wars,

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:84%
such as the old traditions
of Earth, wars of the gods,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:84%
the battles of the
angels, or what we hear

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:90%
from ancient Indian traditions.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a war that is
primarily psychic.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And the human being is
in the middle of it.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But as you may say,
a lot of people

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:90%
are walking blind on autopilot.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So one might ask
themselves, why is it good

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:90%
for me to have this information?

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
How does it change me to
know these cosmic stories?

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
These are such extraordinary
pieces of knowledge.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Will it make me be a better
mother, a better father?

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Will I pay my taxes on time?

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Could I improve my home?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
To know this information
will awaken something in you

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds familiar.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
You start to recover your
memories and everything

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that motivates a human being,
the seeking, the questioning.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And to exit that
autopilot state will

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:90%
affect every part of your life.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are
a better person,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and you get past your
own self seeking,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
you graduate to what the great
masters used to speak about--

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.640 align:middle line:90%
service, compassion.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
ETs admire about humans.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you an example.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that there's a woman
in the subway in New York,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly you
see her small child fall

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:90%
onto the tracks of the train.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:90%
And the train is coming quickly.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
It could potentially impact the
little one in just a moment.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:90%
What would that human mother do?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:90%
She'll jump in.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:84%
If it was an ET,
they might calculate

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
mentally and
mathematically that they

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:84%
don't have the time to go
down there and save the child.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Even if they have a
wonderful intention,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
they realize very quickly
their life will also be lost,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:84%
that they don't really have
the options mathematically.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they will
decide not to do it.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:90%
But our human mother will do it.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's very possible
that the moment

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:84%
she does go down there
and for some type

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of technical coincidence, all of
a sudden, the train turns off.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Or there was some obstacle for
the train that stops the train

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:90%
from killing the child.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:90%
It was not part of the equation.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:90%
That is called magic.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:90%
The mother knew that.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:90%
It is the quality of the humans.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It is the capacity
for us to create.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
It is the revolution
that is affecting humans.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's miracles happening
every day like that all over

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
look up to us actually.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And people think
that we are the--

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial
thinks we're the dumb ones.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But they admire
this energy we have

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
that is stemmed from love
to go beyond our own selves

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and sacrifice ourselves for
each other and the ones we love.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to
do also like you

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
is to have every
human on the planet

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:90%
think about that for everyone.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Because together,
we are so powerful,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:90%
we can stop more than trains.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
When we speak about
love and sacrifice,

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that us
humans can appreciate

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
what this can really mean.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:90%
This includes other worlds.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I have learned another
meaning to the word sacrifice.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:84%
For some people, sacrifice--
it's like self punishment

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:90%
in order to obtain something.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But if we analyze the word,
if we divide it up or at least

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:84%
in Spanish, it can be
understood this way.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] It translates
into my sacred job.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it comes
from the word sacred.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
It is the mission that
humans have to find.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that we
have to deprive ourselves.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But it is to expand
our cosmic vision.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And that involves
contact with others.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we are speaking
about cosmic disclosure.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:90%
And cosmos means order.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
When people hear the
word cosmos which

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
comes from the Greek
language, their minds

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
go to the legendary
program by Carl Sagan.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They imagine planets,
cosmic things.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But cosmos really
means something else.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It means everything--
order, perfection,

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of chaos.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in the cosmos with
what you just explained with all

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
the different extraterrestrial
civilizations out there

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and the different agendas
that they may have,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
is there any conflict that
you're aware of going on?

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a reason for
there to be a conflict between

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the agendas of
those different ETs.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I will try to
explain it according

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:90%
to what they have explained.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
understand a point.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these contactees
are at a disadvantage

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
in our communication with
these entities because

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
of the difference in our
intellect and our comprehension

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and because also
we have to assume

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:84%
that the accounts that
they are telling us

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is exactly how we
are interpreting it.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
However, I should say although
this might also sound mystical

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that this story was
already familiar to me.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It was compatible with my
feelings and my memories.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
As I have traveled
the world and I've

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
studied different traditions,
everything was matching up.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, so that I can
better answer your question,

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
if you go back to
the Sumerian myth

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
where two sibling gods were
confronting each other.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Enlil and Enki, these
were the two sibling gods.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
story that we find

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt with Set and Osiris
who were also sibling gods.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So taking all of these different
myths to the ET experience

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and in relation to us, there are
two positions or two agendas.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:90%
In reality, there's many more.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to reduce
them to two basic positions.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
One of them believes in
us and in our potential

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.560 align:middle line:84%
to develop in this culture of
evolution and learning on Earth

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and how it can affect other
people in the cosmos who view

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:90%
us as their smaller siblings.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the other position

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:90%
that says humans are dangerous.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:90%
They fight among themselves.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Their history shows it.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And if they continue
to progress and expand

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
throughout the cosmos, they will
put our existence in danger.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, we
need to avoid this

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure
that doesn't happen.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:90%
We need to neutralize them.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And the other ones
say, no, we have

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:90%
to give them an opportunity.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And that is the point.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So some other groups
observe us to see

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:90%
how this chess game ends.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you believe there
are any extraterrestrial

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:84%
influence out there that's
trying to guide the destiny

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:90%
for the human civilization?

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.573 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.573 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would have to restate
what we spoke about a few

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
moments ago that the destiny
of the human civilization is

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:90%
their destiny.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It is the destiny of
all of these groups.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
And to be clear with this
answer, the humans and Earth

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
are not the center
of the universe.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.400 align:middle line:84%
There are many other planets
with other humanities,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:90%
other planets that are schools.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:90%
They are also being observed.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:90%
And they are all part of this.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's some
information that I will add.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And it may sound crazy
that some of the souls that

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
lived in those
other planet schools

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
are actually graduating
to this university

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of them
want to study here.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
This is sort of the Harvard
or Cambridge of the universe.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:84%
When I was born
in the year 1974,

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
there was four billion
people on the Earth.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
45 years later, now we're
at over 7 billion people.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
That is how many souls
are here on Earth.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Because Earth is a
very special situation.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
The destiny of
humanity is not just

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:90%
the destiny of this humanity.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the destiny of
many civilizations.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Ricardo, do you believe
there's other influences,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
other extraterrestrial societies
here on the planet right now,

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:84%
in the governments, working
regular jobs that are

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:90%
influencing our destiny?

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a very complex matter
that we're speaking about.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
According to the
information that I have,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:90%
yes, there are influences.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I can't be so ignorant
to ignore those.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But to attribute all of
the problems of humanity

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to these supposed ETs that are
living as politicians that hide

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:84%
themselves in the monarchies
of Europe, no one sees them,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:84%
yet they allow others to
see their reptile qualities

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and that they intake
blood like vampires,

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a different
issue altogether,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:90%
which I don't really agree with.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I do think there
is an influence.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
But I do think it's more
psychic than physical.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not denying that
there are some ETs that

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
have been able to camouflage
themselves as humans.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
it is to the extent

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of conspiracy
theorists make it seem.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
The influence or this
battle is more in our mind.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> How are they
influencing humans?

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned that
instead of being themselves,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:84%
they can actually
maybe infiltrate a body

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and have that vision
of that person.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the main
influence is in our DNA

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and our history,
that in one way,

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:84%
we are able to accomplish
extraordinary and positive

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But we can also repeat
hostile patterns

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
of ancient civilizations.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So whoever ordered to drop
an atomic bomb on Japan,

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:90%
they were not the ETs.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They were humans,
many people that

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:84%
have performed very
hostile acts upon humanity

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
from different nations from
different cultures where

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
no one can call themselves
a hero or innocent

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
because it is a theme that
I see as a global issue.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:90%
They were human.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
We have been capable of
doing such beautiful things

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and also the
saddest, most horrific things.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't reptiles
camouflaged as humans.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.960 align:middle line:90%
It was us that did that.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say that the
main battle is with ourselves.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, in the
duty of taking care

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves or of
taking care of humanity,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
we've had to do
very intense things.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But the day will
come where we are

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
going to evolve because of
love, because of consciousness.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
In order to understand this
better, this inner battle

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
of humans and the cosmic
information that surrounds us,

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:84%
it's just like
when a person says,

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I have suffered
a lot in my life,

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:84%
or this situation caused
me a great deal of pain,

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
or this person really failed
me, or this trauma really

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:90%
broke me into pieces.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:90%
But it all made me grow.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%
One day, we will say
I have grown because

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of love, not because of pain.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I have grown because
of knowledge,

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:90%
not because I keep falling down.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're reaching for.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Life is a lesson for
us like it is for them.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's inevitable.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a rule of the universe.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to keep
running into the same wall

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
That is the inner battle
of the human being.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Because Emery, these worlds,
these beings, their stories,

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:84%
their point, everything,
it's all inside of us.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It's in our genes.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It's in the most intimate
part of our being in our mind.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And as we remember
these things, it's

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:84%
going to activate a
lot of emotions in us.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
ready to address it.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree totally.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That's my belief
system as well to go

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:90%
through all this pain is OK.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.345 align:middle line:84%
Because if I didn't make
mistakes my whole life,

00:22:07.345 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't really get
anywhere and learn anything.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I go
skiing with my friends.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I say, if you're
not falling down,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to get any better.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And I see the whole world
making huge mistakes.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I see it as a blessing
because hopefully most of them

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.880 align:middle line:84%
will learn from these
mistakes so history

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
doesn't repeat itself
in this vicious circle,

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that we can escalate
ourselves and ascend

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
into better consciousness
and a better collective love

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:90%
for the planet.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Ricardo, thank you
for being on the show.
