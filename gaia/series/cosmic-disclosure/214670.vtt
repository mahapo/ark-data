>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent who

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
the 1953 Kingman crash.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.782 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, there's a lot of
discussion about this Kingman

00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
crash, and I do believe you
have the actual file of the 1953

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Kingman crash.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I do.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
A number of us had access to
the actual incident of 1953.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to relate exactly
what that case file says.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
probably be a lot different

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.775 align:middle line:84%
than some of the other reports
that's been on the internet.

00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So tell us about it.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: First of all, let's
talk about Kingman, Arizona.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1940s, where the
airport is located today,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Kingman, there was an
Army Airfield there.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And they trained pilots from
about 41 up to about 46 or 47.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And after that, after about 47,
they maintained a base there

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:90%
at the old Army Airfield.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
It was in caretaker status
right up until about 1956

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
when it was turned over
to the city of Kingman.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.846 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, an
airport was built there.

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
By May of 1953, there
was a master sergeant,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the several caretakers
for the Army Airfield.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:90%
He was on duty.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And his job was to just
watch over the airfield.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
One day in May, he saw a bright
light coming in from the north.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, my gosh,
what could that be?

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
It was extremely bright,
brighter than any aircraft.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But he thought it
was an aircraft.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:90%
But he watched it.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And it eventually crashed some
distance east of his location

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:90%
at the Army Airfield.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So he figured it was
an airplane crash.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So he notified the Mojave
County Sheriff's Department

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:90%
by telephone.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
About 40 minutes later,
a deputy came out.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And with the deputy
in separate vehicles,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
they drove out towards
the crash site.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The site wasn't
around any roads,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:84%
so they had to go off road
to get to this crash site.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
When they arrived
at the crash site,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
they found a
saucer-shaped objects

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:90%
embedded into the ground.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, neither Kurt, the master
sergeant, or the deputy

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
knew anything about
extraterrestrials, or flying

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
saucers, or anything like that.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So they were confused
exactly what this thing was.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But what the master
sergeant knew

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
was that there was a base that
was doing nuclear testing up

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:90%
in Nevada.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Nevada Test Range, it was
called back in those days.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
He thought maybe this
is something from there.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So as he got closer,
a door opened.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And out came this about
5-foot-looking human.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
But they looked at it, and
they realized it wasn't human.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:90%
It looked similar to a human.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But the eyes and face and
body structure was different.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So the deputy said,
I think this is

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:90%
a spacecraft from outer space.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And so this little
entity walks up to them

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and starts talking in a language
that they couldn't understand.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
They first thought it was maybe
Russian, but neither one of them

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:90%
could understand Russian.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Although Kurt was in Europe
during the war, World War II,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
he knew some German and French,
the deputy was in the Pacific

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and he knew some Japanese.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And he kept telling Kurt
that this is Japanese.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.760 align:middle line:84%
This thing was
speaking Japanese.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, it
wasn't Japanese.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So the deputy went
back to his truck

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and tried to call on a radio.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:90%
The radio wouldn't work.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the truck
wouldn't start.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:90%
So Kurt went over to his Jeep.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And he had remnants of
a World War II Jeep.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
He got in the Jeep and tried to
use his radio telephone to call

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:90%
back, and it didn't work.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, so now they're stuck out
there in the middle of nowhere

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.048 align:middle line:90%
with this--

00:04:49.048 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This little guy.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --spacecraft
and this little guy.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And this little guy, they
didn't know what to do with him.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:84%
He kept talking and
talking and talking.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they noticed
that he had bruising.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
His skin was discolored,
but they weren't sure

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
if that was a spacesuit or
if it was an actual skin.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But finally, it sat
down by the craft.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the deputy and Kurt decided
somebody had to go get help.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
So Kurt says, I'll stay.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Deputy, you have to walk back.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good
12, 14 miles back.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:90%
So he started back.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
What they didn't know, there
was a geological survey team

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
in close area of
this crash site,

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
but they were still
a few miles off.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
They saw the crash, so
they were coming to it.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And they had two vehicles.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:90%
So Kurt stayed.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And he heard the
vehicles coming.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
He knew what happened to
the both of their vehicles,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:90%
the deputy's and his vehicle.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And they figured
it had something

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:90%
to do with this saucer.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So he ran down the field
because there was no road there

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:90%
and stopped this vehicle--

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:90%
these two vehicles.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know that they
were this geological team

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and said, stop, stop, stop.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there
was a crash site here.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.805 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what type
of vehicle that was.

00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Our vehicles didn't
operate, so we don't want

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:90%
you to get too close to it.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And so these scientists,
some of them were geologists,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
they got out and they
said, well, let's go over.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.050 align:middle line:90%
We'll keep our vehicles here.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.785 align:middle line:84%
So this one geologist goes
over and looks and says,

00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that is a craft
from outer space.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And these are space people.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So they said, well, we'll
go back and get our vehicle

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and drive back to Kingman
and notify authorities.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And Kurt says, you need to
notify the Army at Fort Irwin.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And you need a notify
the Marines at Barstow

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and have them come out
here because there's

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:90%
a flying saucer that crashed.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:90%
So they left.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, seven
hours later, which

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:84%
was way in the afternoon--
this thing crashed

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
in the early mornings--
finally, the deputy comes back.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And he comes back with
some other deputies.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
They parked away,
about a mile away.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And so seven hours
later, the Army

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:90%
comes, the cavalry, so to speak.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And along with them came
an FBI agent, an FBI agent

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Farley.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And the FBI agent
was from Las Vegas.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And not sure exactly who
notified the FBI agent,

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:90%
but he was there.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And so they all walked around.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.700 align:middle line:90%
They put a perimeter around.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And two of the Army
personnel from Fort Irwin--

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and there was, I think, 10
or 12 of them that arrived--

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
went inside the craft.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And they found four
other entities.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And they were alive.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:90%
So they were five total.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But they were laying down,
cuddling as if they were scared

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:90%
or protecting themselves.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Army people tried to get
them out, come on out, come on

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
out, get out, yelling
for them to get out.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, they all came out.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And they all sat
on the ground next

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
to the craft and
the other entity

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.245 align:middle line:90%
that had already been outside.

00:08:34.245 --> 00:08:36.735 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How large was this
craft, for the audience?

00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The craft
was about, I think,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:90%
45 to 50 feet in diameter.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It was saucer-shaped.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:90%
It was bulged.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.773 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So a soldier could
walk in there obviously?

00:08:47.773 --> 00:08:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, the
soldier could walk in.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Hunching down, he was
able to get in there.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
These things looked--
they had a head

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:84%
of almost like a human with no
ears, a small nose, a mouth,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:90%
huge eyes.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Their hands were just like
ours, four fingers and a thumb.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:90%
They had strange-looking feet.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:90%
They're more clubfoot.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
They had a suit on,
one piece, jumpsuit.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.205 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Any hair?

00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And they had no
hair, no hair whatsoever.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:90%
They were grayish colored.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
The geologist, when
they came back,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
he said that they
had some equipment

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that they could check to make
sure there wasn't any radiation

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
because this geologist was
convinced that there would

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
be a radiation and everybody
would be in danger of radiation.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
anybody in that craft

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
except for the
military personnel.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:90%
They camped out all night.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
The next morning,
early in the morning,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
a military Air Force team
came from Indian Springs.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And this was the newly
formed SDART team,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:84%
which was out of the Air
Technical Intelligence Center

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:90%
They were controlled there.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:90%
They came out.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And they had Air
Force technicians

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and knew exactly what to do.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 1953.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the first DART
missions that were out there?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.665 align:middle line:84%
That must have been
the biggest one.

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
They were formed after the
'47 to '49 crash, the Roswell

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and the Pelona Peak crash.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force
realized at that time

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that they had to have
a team, a special team,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to be able to recover and
operate around and collect

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:90%
evidence at these scenes.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why they
formed the SDART team.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And these technicians knew--

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
actually, two technicians
went in the craft

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.515 align:middle line:84%
and were able to
disconnect something.

00:10:53.515 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
The report doesn't
go into details

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
on that, which
allowed other vehicles

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and radios to operate normally.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So they were able
to maybe disconnect

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:90%
electronics or whatever inside.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So these two
technicians knew that.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So my question was always,
well, how did they know that?

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:84%
But DART's never answered
it in the report.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the technician
went into the craft

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:90%
and did detect radiation.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Inside the craft, there were
these five containers with fluid

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
in them, just similar to
another story we talked about.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And there were other bundles
of what they thought was dirt.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:90%
But that was radioactive.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So they figured it
was maybe uranium.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, the military
commander at the scene

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:84%
immediately detected something
that was out of their realm.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So they notified the Atomic
Energy Commission, which

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%
was in effect in those days.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were located in Nevada
at the Nevada Test Range.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And so they came down.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the Atomic
Energy Commission was there.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's also
this Fritz guy that's

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:90%
actually been on the internet.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
His name was on the
internet as being there.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, Fritz didn't work for a
private company like somebody

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
claimed.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Fritz worked for Sandia
Laboratories back in those days.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was an expert in
reconstructing things.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was he actually
used mathematical principles

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to determine the force
used for that thing

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to crash and indent
itself into 5 feet of dirt

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it was.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Fritz Warner's
job was out there at the site.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was out there during
the entire time period

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.450 align:middle line:84%
because Sandia National
Laboratories actually came out.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the
problem they had, was

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
what are they going
to do with these--

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who gets them?

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --five alien
extraterrestrials.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a containment
facility in 1953 at Groom Lake.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:90%
In fact, Area 51 wasn't even--

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just being
formed back in those days.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
The only bases up there
was Indian Springs,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.825 align:middle line:84%
which was an Air Force base
and Nellis Air Force base.

00:13:14.825 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:90%
But they did have--

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
US government did have a
facility at Los Alamos National

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Laboratories because
that's where IBA lived.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So the consensus
over a number of days

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
was to get these things, these
extraterrestrials someplace.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So Los Alamos brought down some
form of containment vehicle.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't say what
it was in the report.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
They put these things
in this containment.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And they bust them-- or they
truck them back to Los Alamos

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:90%
National Laboratories.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they had some kind
of facility to keep them there.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, they had
to recover the crash craft

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:90%
and get that someplace.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, we didn't
have Groom Lake,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:90%
so where they going to take it?

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have Tonopah Test
Range or Air Force Base.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:90%
We had Indian Springs.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nellis.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.817 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: We had Nellis.

00:14:08.817 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But they had facilities
at Fort Irwin,

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:90%
the Army base in California.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
The Einstein commander was,
in fact, an army colonel.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
we're going to have

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to put this on some kind
of a flatbed or something.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So over a period
of days, they were

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
able to get it on a flatbed
using a crane, I guess, or--

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
anyway, they transported
it to Fort Irwin.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was at Fort Irwin from
1953, a lot of part of 1953

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:90%
until 1968.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So all those years that Kingman
crash craft was at Fort Irwin.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't at
these facilities

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that people are talking
about on the internet.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a picture of
this craft in an ammunition

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:90%
revetment, big, huge bunker.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And it showed it inside.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:90%
They had to take the doors off.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It looked to me like
based on the picture

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and knowing what a
revetment or a bunker

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
looks like, they had
to take the doors off.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.412 align:middle line:84%
And they had to modify it to
get this thing inside of it.

00:15:16.412 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's enormous.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.287 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's enormous.

00:15:18.287 --> 00:15:19.087 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:90%
They actually got it in there.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they somehow
covered it up.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:90%
There's no picture of that.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And how they got it from
Fort Irwin to Groom Lake

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:90%
is another story.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.322 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's quite the haul.

00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But if you know
where Fort Irwin is,

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:90%
that's not too far from Nevada.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to convoy it
with a cover over it in 1960

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:84%
all the way to Tonopah,
at least the gold water

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
side of the Nellis Test and
Training Range, into there.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
obviously they got it.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:90%
So now the story goes--

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:90%
now, the report is pretty much--

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:84%
it talks about a lot of
other things pertaining

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
to the recovery
process, the SDART team.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
They brought in different army
units and different Air Force

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:90%
units to analyze.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
they tried to do,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
which was out of the
ordinary-- and this is 1953--

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.397 align:middle line:84%
they actually brought
some pilots in--

00:16:25.397 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure where
the pilots came from,

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:90%
they didn't say--

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to try to fly this
thing out of there.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.138 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, it didn't work
because there was no way.

00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:84%
They said, go in there
and try to fly this.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And the pilots say, well,
how does this thing work?

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:90%
And how do you fly it?

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is '53.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they also thought about
letting the ET, one of the ETs

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:90%
fly it.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't
communicate with them.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They still couldn't
communicate with them.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were a lot of stories
about how they communicated

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:90%
with them years later.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So now they have five
that they eventually

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.182 align:middle line:90%
must have taken to Groom Lake.

00:17:03.182 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these
organic beings,

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:84%
or are they
programmed life forms?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.979 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No, they're biologics.

00:17:08.979 --> 00:17:09.779 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Biologics.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.325 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're biological
as far as I know.

00:17:12.325 --> 00:17:14.665 align:middle line:84%
The report doesn't go
into any more details.

00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:17.625 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
they call them
human-skinned in the report.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.479 align:middle line:84%
But this is '53 terminology,
so I don't think they realize--

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:27.479 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Any correlation
with J-Rod or anything?

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we think
one of them is J-Rod.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
We think the one that first got
out, he's actually the J-Rod.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so he's
been around since 1953.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one
that is assisting us

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:90%
at Groom Lake with technologies.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that craft and maybe
some other of their crafts

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:90%
have crashed.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's the story.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.905 align:middle line:90%
That's the official story.

00:17:56.905 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
watching this

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:84%
are going to say, well, I've
heard this guy talk about this.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is in a
classified report,

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.187 align:middle line:90%
formally classified report.

00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:07.770 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
people that talked

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:90%
about this many years ago.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Robert Dean tells this
entire story almost verbatim,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%
what I've talked about.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And he never had
access to that report.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:90%
He had another report.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Wendelle Stevens talks about it.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:84%
There's other people
that have talked

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:90%
about this for many years.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.735 align:middle line:84%
So that's the story of
the 1953 Kingman crash.

00:18:28.735 --> 00:18:31.488 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So is J-Rod
still alive today?

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:32.905 align:middle line:84%
And what can you
tell us about it?

00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, as you
know, I spoke of J-Rod

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:90%
in an episode or two.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:84%
When I was a counterintelligence
officer out at Groom Lake,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I saw a vehicle
with J-Rod on it.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was educated
in what that meant.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And so there was somebody,
whether it was still

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
this particular
entity or a newer one.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
J-Rod or an entity like J-Rod
was still helping us at least

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:84%
1985 out at Groom
Lake at Area 51.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you understood or
believe in Captain Dan Burisch,

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:84%
he talks about J-Rod still
being out there in the '90s.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
If you talked about this one
other person, who I'm not

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
going to mention his name and
talked about UFO convention

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:84%
in 2009, he talks about
J-Rod still being out there.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So whether it is the
same J-Rod, same entity,

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
or another one, and they
just referred to it as J-Rod.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.845 align:middle line:90%
That's what I know.

00:19:32.845 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did we learn
anything more about J-Rod

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and where his people
actually come from?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think the
story goes that he

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.090 align:middle line:84%
came he comes from
a very nearby star

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.575 align:middle line:84%
system, Alpha Centauri,
and the planet close

00:19:46.575 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
to that star system.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's just
something I heard.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.745 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that's
absolutely fact.

00:19:55.745 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well,
there was a plethora

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:84%
of organizations and
three-letter agencies

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:90%
out there at this incident.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Which one stands out to you
that you'd like to talk about?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think the
Atomic Energy Commission

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:90%
was a more important one.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
When the Air Force technicians
detected radioactive material

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
in that dirt, was the
whole craft radioactive?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
We knew a lot about
radiation back in those days

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
because we just tested a nuclear
weapon and used two in combat.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And we were building
more out in Los Alamos.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So the Atomic Energy
Commission got there

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
for a specific
purpose, is determining

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
whether everybody
that's out there

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:84%
was in danger of
being irradiated

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:84%
with whatever
radioactive material was

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:90%
inside that spacecraft.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And they spent a lot
of time out there.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
They brought other
resources out there.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
According to the
reports, they actually

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
were able to take all
that material, the dirt

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
in those containers,
out of that spacecraft

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:90%
and carted it away to wherever.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.525 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure where.

00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were
their findings then?

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The question was,
what was their findings?

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The findings was that
it was uranium ore.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.268 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's another
bigger question.

00:21:19.268 --> 00:21:21.435 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do they have
uranium ore on that craft?

00:21:21.435 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Why did this
particular spacecraft,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different star
system, want uranium ore?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Why did they have so much of it?

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there were--

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember, but
it was quite a quantity,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
like a quarter of a ton or
something to that effect.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.478 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.478 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing with that?

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess the
biggest question is maybe

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know what
it was, number one.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have
uranium on their planet,

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
or they had uranium and they
didn't know how to use it,

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't
have enough of it.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And so now this mission for
this particular spacecraft

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
was to go to our planet and find
uranium ore and bring it back.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's why.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were using it for
something entirely different.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
We just can't imagine what
they might be using it for.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible to
say maybe they were taking it

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:90%
so we couldn't use it?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In 1953, I
don't know, maybe,

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
because any extraterrestrial
race that was watching Earth

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and had the technology to look
into Earth back in those days--

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and of course, if they
have the technology

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to fly millions or
billions of miles here,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:84%
they certainly
have the technology

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:90%
or could have to watch us.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:84%
We just detonated
a nuclear weapon

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:90%
in a desert of New Mexico.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And we used two nuclear weapons
to kill hundreds of thousands

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:90%
They see this.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a hostile
race of people here.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they want to
gather all this uranium

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and get it out of here so
we couldn't build any more.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.508 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's--

00:23:03.508 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
looking back at it, I
don't that's feasible

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
because we're a big planet.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure if they could
find that little bit--

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a little
less than a ton--

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
they knew there was
more on this planet.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
possibly take it all.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they
never figured it out?

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Not that I know of.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we did.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the big--
another big question

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is, was it used for
their propulsion?

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Did they have a
nuclear propulsion

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.310 align:middle line:84%
system, and that uranium
ore, all they had to do

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:84%
is pour it in to their reactor
or their engine propulsion

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
system and it would create
uranium-238, or plutonium,

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, maybe.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.135 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know that they
ever figured that out?

00:23:49.135 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
the debris material

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:90%
that was scattered around?

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Any technologies that were
reverse-engineered to come out

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:90%
of that or?

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I'm sure there was.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But remember, this is
1953, and our technology

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:90%
hadn't advanced very much.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
We had a 1947 craft
and a 1949 craft.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:90%
So we had at least two crafts.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's rumors
that we probably

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
had a '51 craft that had
crashed someplace else.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know enough
about that to talk.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have at least three
and maybe even four crafts.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And now we're trying to
understand these crafts.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.330 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
reverse-engineer these crafts.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
study the propulsion

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:84%
system, the communications
device, the electrical devices

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:90%
in these things.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is '53
technology, so we probably

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.905 align:middle line:84%
haven't advanced very
much to understand

00:24:42.905 --> 00:24:43.905 align:middle line:90%
how this thing operated.

00:24:43.905 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you find
significant from the Kingman

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
crash compared to all the
crashes around that time?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: One of the things
that's very interesting

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.075 align:middle line:84%
is that all the
occupants survived.

00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Five occupants.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The five
of them survived.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
You look at the Eban
crash in 1947 at Corona,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
only one survived,
the others died.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:84%
The crash at 1949, Pelona
Peak, all of them died.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They never even got
out of the craft.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about the '51,
whether it was real or not.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So we knew this one,
five of them survived.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, that's
positive for us.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And what did we learn
from these five?

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:84%
How did we communicate
or eventually

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:90%
communicate with these five?

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if one
of them was J-Rod,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:84%
we were able to
communicate with it.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to maybe
teach it English or whatever.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
If they could speak
some form of a language

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:84%
where their vocal
cords are able,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.795 align:middle line:84%
then we could teach them
English or some other language.

00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you ever
find anything out

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:84%
about where the
other may have went,

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or what happened
to them, all five?

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's
nothing ever mentioned

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.070 align:middle line:90%
in the classified report.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Even after years
when you were in there,

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:84%
you didn't see any
briefings or any files

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%
about anything about it?

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I knew that there were
other visitors, so to speak.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the unique things
I've never talked about

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
was there was two designations
of species thrown around

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:90%
at Area 51.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:23.280 align:middle line:84%
One was visitors and
one was creatures.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.045 align:middle line:90%
Now, to distinguish the two--

00:26:26.045 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't briefed
into it, so I don't

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:90%
know how they distinguished.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But just common sense
tells me the visitors

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:84%
were there on their own
accord, maybe voluntarily.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we had an
exchange program.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.440 align:middle line:84%
If you want to think about Serpo
or some other kind of exchange

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:84%
program that Linda Moulton Howe
talks about that's out there.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.097 align:middle line:90%
And then the creatures are what?

00:26:50.097 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The creatures are the
ones that we captured,

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that were in crash crafts,
that were hostile towards us.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:01.095 align:middle line:84%
But to distinguish between
a visitor and a creature,

00:27:01.095 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:90%
that's a big leap right there.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd say the visitors were
probably all benevolent

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.805 align:middle line:84%
and the creatures
were probably not.

00:27:10.805 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
that the occupants

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.742 align:middle line:84%
of this craft, the five of
them, let's say one is J-Rod,

00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
do you think we would
give them the opportunity

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:90%
of the other four to go home?

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Understanding
the command structure

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:35.872 align:middle line:84%
of whoever is in charge of
MJ-12 back then, I don't know.

00:27:35.872 --> 00:27:37.642 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like,
here's your craft--

00:27:37.642 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We certainly
don't want to lose

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial craft
with the technologies

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that we can learn
from that craft.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want that craft
to be taken away from us.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And then perhaps, maybe--

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the craft was
damaged in some way

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have the
equipment or the materials

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.742 align:middle line:90%
to repair it here.

00:28:01.742 --> 00:28:03.575 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's always
that possibility, too.

00:28:03.575 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did this event
affect the community of Kingman

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.325 align:middle line:90%
in the following years?

00:28:08.325 --> 00:28:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, it was classified
for a number of years.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
1964, a newspaper reporter
heard a rumor about the case.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And he heard it from a Mojave
Sheriff's County dispatcher.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:84%
She tells a story to him
at a barbecue or a cookout

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:90%
with his wife and her husband.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And she tells this story to him.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
did this happen?

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:90%
And she tells him.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:45.330 align:middle line:84%
She said, I was dispatching
that day in May of 1953.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a flying saucer that
crashed because that's what they

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:90%
were saying over the radio.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.735 align:middle line:84%
And this reporter said,
well, where did it crash at?

00:28:52.735 --> 00:28:53.535 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:55.884 align:middle line:84%
But it's out past the
old Army Airfield.

00:28:55.884 --> 00:28:58.426 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You think that's what
launched these investigations?

00:28:58.426 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think that opened up
a lot because a reporter talked

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and spread rumors
and other people

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
heard him, in 1972,
the newspaper article,

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and then other people
got a hold of it.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And they started
exaggerating these things,

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:90%
what actually happened.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And then they talked
about three other--

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:84%
or two other crashes that
occurred in that same year.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And so people just heard
one rumor, created this--

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Added more spacecraft.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.325 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Added more stories.

00:29:36.325 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A couple balloons.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, the balloon.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:84%
That was the most
fascinating story.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:84%
This woman reports that the
extraterrestrials got out

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:50.460 align:middle line:84%
of the spacecraft and hooked
up this balloon to them

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and they flew away in a balloon.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And she says it was just like
Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
any new conclusions

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.365 align:middle line:84%
that have been drawn
today after everything?

00:30:03.365 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think we realized
that these things aren't

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
safe in our atmosphere,
at least in 1953,

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and that these weather anomalies
or atmospheric anomalies

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.620 align:middle line:84%
can affect the operation
or the avionics

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:84%
of these extraterrestrial crafts
and cause them to crash, like,

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.640 align:middle line:90%
for example, this one.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, I'm glad you
brought this report to us

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.867 align:middle line:84%
