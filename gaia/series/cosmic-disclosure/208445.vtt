>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're at an undisclosed

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:10%
location with Tim.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:10%
in relation to extraterrestrial
groups and contact with Earth.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, are the Greys working
or in contact with any

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:90%
governments?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And what time frame are we
talking about historically?

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So people are often confusing
two species that have some

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:84%
relationship together, but are
not one in the same species.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about Roswell
and Corona, New Mexico in 1947,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
there were some Grey
beings in that crash.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
descriptions to them

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that occur in media and
as well as in research.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
people are mistaking

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
those beings were lying
on the Mexican desert

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and screaming in
pain with the Greys.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:84%
The beings that at that
time crashed in New Mexico

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
have been called Eben,
which includes the part

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
biological being, while as
the Greys have developed

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:90%
bodies that are artificial.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys cannot feel any
pain because they have those

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
fiber-structured artificial
puppets that they are using

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
for exploring different
parts of the universe,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
while as the Ebens,
as a biological being,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
they suffer and they feel
and they have all that.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The Greys have developed beyond
the capability of feeling

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
heavy emotions and pain, which
they thought at one point

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
would hinder their
evolution, because love

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
can bring certain problems, I
mean, broken heart or hostility

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:90%
and rivalry and those things.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And they try to overcome
those challenges by just

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:90%
getting rid of all that.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much
evolved superficially.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
They do not reproduce,
while I'm not

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
100 percent sure if the
Ebens reproduce biologically,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
but I think that they do,
while as the Greys do not.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:90%
They do not have sex.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They do not have
that kind of taste.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And they also do not dream.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Those are experiences
that they eliminated

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
from their experience, which
makes things a little easier

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, but also makes
them a lot more denaturalized

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:90%
compared to a biological being.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you consider the Greys
and advanced AI or robotic type

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:90%
of being?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I would agree maybe on
the robotic thing in terms

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
of the body that they
are using is superficial,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
whereas humans and many, many
other species have biological

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing is that
the biological body, even

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
if it's not acknowledged by
humans, the biological body

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of very specific
and individual intelligence.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And when the communication is
correct between body, mind,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and soul, naturally a super
potent and interesting

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:90%
connection can occur.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And while the Greys only
saw the disadvantages,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
they got rid of
the body, I think--

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:90%
and this is my theory--

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
because people get so scared
when they see those Greys,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered
why that is.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:90%
And it is scary.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It feels like when
you're close to the Greys

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that your whole body receives a
frequency that the body reacts

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
to in fear, anxiety
of something.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that as
this biological being,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
this biological body has a
very individual and subjective

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
intelligence to it,
and also memory, it

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
might recognize that
this species has killed

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:84%
their own bodies,
which makes it kind

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
of a threat or danger
to the existence

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:90%
of the own biological body.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:90%
This is my theory.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
that, but I've always

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
wondered why it feels so
uncomfortable around them.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that might
be the reason why.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Just in the same reason
why people freak out

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
when they see a spider or
something or an insect,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and even if it's totally not
harmful and not dangerous,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:90%
they freak out.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just, oh my god,
there's a spider.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, this shiver that
runs over your body.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And insects are way--

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
they have this way bigger
biological mass on this planet.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They have so many
more individual units

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:90%
compared to humans.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is something
that the body picks up

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
on and reacts that way.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just my theory.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a lot of ET
contact reported ever since we

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.630 align:middle line:90%
detonated the atomic bomb.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And how much of these contacts
are from the Greys or Ebens?

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And what was it about
the bomb that attracted

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:90%
so much attention from them?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So as much as I
understand of the Ebens,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
they are a lot less invasive
compared to the Greys.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are pretty much not
respecting boundaries at all.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You can say that, while the
Ebens, even in the first place,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
were a lot more observative
and a lot more noninvasive

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
compared to the Greys.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
In the time on when the
first Ebens appeared

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
in Corona, Mexico and
Roswell, New Mexico,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
some kind of relationship
between the military

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
or the Earth people
and the Ebens began.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as
if the Ebens have

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
helped a lot talking about
technology and other stuff.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I also think that the Ebens
are way less militarized

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:90%
compared to the Greys.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
We also know that Greys and
Ebens have been in conflict

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And to my understanding, it
is why the Ebens and the Greys

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:90%
share some kind of lineage.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.510 align:middle line:84%
While, as we know,
the Greys always

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
reach back to their breed or
to their previous versions

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and try to erase
memory, I think that was

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
something that was in conflict
with what the Ebens actually

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They want to be alive and
develop independently.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
That is my understanding to
this very long, intense conflict

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
between Ebens and Greys
that occurred and lasted,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to my knowledge,
several thousand years.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe some
physiological traits of both

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:90%
the Greys and the Ebens?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we're talking
about the fiberglass,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:90%
typical greyish Grey--

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and I need to add to
that that this species is

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:90%
evolving quickly, very quickly.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So in every second, they
are changing and modifying

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
in such a rapid speed
that it's really hard

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
to keep up with that.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens as a biological
being are putting more weight

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
on a more natural
approach to evolution,

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
although they are also
manipulating genetics

00:09:54.610 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and working on that and using
technology and wisdom in order

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate their
own evolution.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:10%
But they have a different
approach to that.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:10%
The Ebens, as I am aware,
are bigger in size.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:10%
And they have
anatomical features,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:10%
for example, a nose and a
functioning digestive track,

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:10%
whereas the Greys
in the puppet form,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:10%
they seem to be energized by
some kind of other technology

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:10%
other than eating and
drinking and digesting,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:10%
which makes it easier for
them to go on missions far

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:10%
beyond what the Ebens
would be capable of.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So what about the head size
and the height differences

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%
between the Greys and the Ebens?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And how tall would
each of them be

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
if they were standing
right next to you?

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There are bigger Greys that
are stronger and more capable

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:90%
of combat situation.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And those are some kind
of warrior class to them.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
They have different
other personnel

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that varies in size
and body features.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So I would say the
Greys pretty much,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe that
big, whereas the Ebens

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:90%
are a meter and a half in size.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:84%
If I compare them
in my memory, I

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
would say that the Ebens
have the bigger head.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:84%
They also tend to have
a more rounded head,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Greys have a
more almond size of head.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys have
no body openings.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And they lost some body
features, no navel--

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, the Ebens don't
have navels, too, but nothing,

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:90%
no ears, no nostril, no nose.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they wear uniforms?

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Or were they naked?

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The Ebens wear a uniform.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this
is what they appeared

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
in the first place, like 1947.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, they do
wear some kind of uniform.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It's like some kind of overall.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:90%
The Greys do not.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
They do not wear a visual
overall or something.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:84%
They have some kind
of, some kind of cover

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%
around the body, which
is crystal clear.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:90%
You can look through it.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the covering a
tight-fitting one-piece or is

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:90%
it not visible at all?

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It's super tight fitting.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a film or
something, transparent film

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that is on the
skin of the Greys.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>> What about their eyes?

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greys, they
don't have eyelids,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:90%
while the Ebens do have eyelids.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't quote me on that.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I might be mistaken.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
is one difference

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:90%
between those species.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The technology the Greys
use for the eyes, which

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
can see a lot more
frequencies and receive

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:84%
a lot more information, seems
to be different and more

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
superficial, artificial
than the eyes of the Ebens,

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
which I think even has
some kind of eyeball.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There were some exchange
programs between humans

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:90%
and the Greys or Ebens.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of that?

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the Ebens are in
close contact with Earth people

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and that a small number of
Ebens is located somewhere here

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
on this planet in order to
guide and help, inspire,

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and give tactical information
for the people on Earth.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>> In your
professional capacity,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.440 align:middle line:84%
you've been in contact with
the Greys and not the Ebens?

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I had only one incident
with what would be called Eben.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've only looked into
those files in relationship

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to the Greys and because of
their very long and heavy

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:84%
conflict with them,
which seems to be over.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
They're in peace now.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Greys are involved
with countries worldwide

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and some of these countries
seem to be in opposition to one

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:90%
another, how does that play out?

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the strategies
that the Greys brought

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
into this Earthly context
was to balance out military

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
advancements.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
different countries

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
have nuclear atomic
bombs and the reason why

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
different countries
have certain crafts

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans
in the first place

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
were building and pretty
much had around 1947--

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
we already mentioned
this incident

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
with Admiral Byrd
in 1947 which shows

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:90%
that there are those crafts.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And although the Greys
were pretty aware

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that things could turn
out badly when technology

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
is too heavily put upon
Earth, and they were warning

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot about technology,
at some point or another,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
they found that it's better
to build a strategic balancing

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
instead of shutting down
and taking the weapons away

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> From your experience, their
involvement with different

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:84%
nations is to balance dynamics
on the planet or to instigate

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:90%
challenges?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never heard about an
incident where the Greys did

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:90%
some provocative action for fun.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I know that here and
there, they did things

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
pretty invasive in and shaky and
bringing things into disbalance

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring disruptive
energy to timelines

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think,
while there are

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
some species that poke
things just for fun,

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:90%
the Greys wouldn't do that.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:84%
If they bring
something in disorder,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
it's because they think that
the energy that is kicking in

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:84%
brings things more
into their direction

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and into their advantages.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There has been many reports
of cow mutilation stories.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Is that some government
experiment attributed to ETs?

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Or is it actually ETs?

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know that the Greys
was testing some noninvasive

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
technology on some
animals on this planet.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not aware of any kind
of mutilation whatsoever.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some videos recently
that shows walking cows

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
that are opened up on one side.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can see all the
organs and no blood.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:90%
The cow is still alive.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:84%
This just don't fit
the way the Greys move.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not their signature.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
Greys very rarely

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:90%
speak about their own mistakes.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not sure.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Tim, who's doing that?

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question, and why?

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It might create
some kind of fear

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:90%
around the phenomenon of UFOs.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And that might be a reason.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But I've no idea
who's doing that.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Ebens interact
with humans, military,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and government groups.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Greys interact with the
same types of groups.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Are they in opposition
to each other?

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that Ebens in the
first place didn't want to be

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:90%
in direct contact with humans.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I think they had more of this
observation mission going

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
on, being not directly
and invasively contacting

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:90%
governments or militaries.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is a
different approach compared

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:90%
to what the Greys have done.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But once they were in
contact with people,

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that they were pretty
benevolent and very gently

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
guiding and helping
human people,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
whereas the connection
to the Greys

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:84%
is more focused on technology
and what can people

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:90%
gain from that.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the previous rivalry
between Ebens and Greys result

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
in some fight for
control on Earth?

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think the war between
the Ebens and Greys were pretty

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:90%
direct.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
They had some terrible
losses and a lot

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of destruction going on.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that there was
direct war-like scenarios

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
on Earth between Ebens and
Greys, even though I think--

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and this is my theory--

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys played a
little wingman game in order

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
to bring Ebens in contact
with Earth people, like hey,

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:90%
you know, you know those guys?

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Here, here you go.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When the Greys contact
governments or military forces

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and then when they contact
humans who are seemingly

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:84%
insignificant in terms
of being influential,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:84%
are those two different
contact agendas?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Or are they one and the same?

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the Greys did a lot
of effort in order to contact

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:84%
humanity and always have and
always will have the same

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:84%
agenda going on in order to
evolve into a very stable

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
next-generation being and
then getting rid of every old

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:90%
memory.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And through that, they
have this approach

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
to hands-on solve every paradox
there is in the universe.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
dedicated mission over--

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
they have probably the
longest period of evolution

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:90%
known to the universe yet.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Who's interacting with our
human influencers the most?

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it the Greys or the Ebens?

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a big chaos
of influences on this planet.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.260 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
species directly,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:84%
nondirectly, frequential
beings, interdimensional beings.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in some way or
another connecting to somebody.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not very easy to
say who has the most contact.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I think the Greys are pretty
nonchalant, so to speak.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
They just go for it, whereas
other beings are more

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:84%
observing the deer from
distance and holding

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
the bread as long as necessary
until the deer comes.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:90%
And they'll just go for it.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, what's your overall
impression about all this

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
contact with the
Greys with humanity?

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I can totally understand why
being in contact with the Greys

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
is something that
can frighten people.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:90%
I can totally understand that.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I have also learned myself
and through all the reports

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that I have come
across that being

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
able to reflect on it, on every
encounter and every interaction

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:84%
with them, that it never
has been that bad as it

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:90%
felt in the first place.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:90%
So I think that--

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't have spent
so much time with them

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:90%
if I didn't feel that way.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that
their mission is

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:84%
worthy in some ways or
another to the universe.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
A species that has experienced
that amount of trauma

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:84%
in the first place and given
so much energy and dedication

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
into healing that, even
though it's, I know,

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:84%
not very smoothly
and passionate,

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:84%
compassionately
ruled out and done,

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
kind of species

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
deserves rest and cure,
just as every other species

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel we're
part of their healing?

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, totally, 100%.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And what way are we
part of their healing?

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In the way that this
species at some point has been

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
so isolated, and if you put
it down in terms of humanity,

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
has experienced such a loss
of friendship that I think

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
the approach humans can have
as being friends to another,

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
that this can be something very
healing and very beneficial

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:90%
That's my approach to them.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> As you describe
their isolation,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:84%
you almost seem
emotional about it.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very emotional about
it, because I felt their pain

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and having this impression of
being so alone in the universe

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and being so convinced that
there's no one out there

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's all an illusion
and there's nothing.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:84%
If you compare that
to the impression

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.800 align:middle line:84%
that other beings
have, which say,

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
all right, OK, we're
all one, but, I mean,

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:84%
we are one on so many
beautiful ways, in every way

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.960 align:middle line:84%
we can interact with each
other, in so many ways,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:90%
and we've never been alone.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:90%
We never will be alone.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And at every point of our
existence, we be our own homes.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:90%
We be our own friends.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
We give all the love
we want to each other.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And we embrace ourselves by
this compassion and that love.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:90%
That's heavy.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, thank you so much
for being on the show.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for having
this conversation.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure"--

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of the examples
of these ET technologies?

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There's the technology that
sends signals to the body,

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:84%
knows where to repair
and how to repair,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and then accelerate
the speed of healing.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What other medical
technologies do you know about?

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The most impressive thing
was a vibrational plate.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And it repairs the field of
frequency inside of your body,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
could substitute any coffee
that is used in this world.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What type of technologies
have you seen in the field

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.060 align:middle line:90%
of communications?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>> From the Greys, they are
using this interconnected

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:84%
communication network that
goes all over the universe.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty optimistic
that we have

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
huge, wondrous, interesting
science and technology coming

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:90%
in the next one or two years.
