00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are talking about

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:10%
the intergalactic space station
at Jupiter with Randy Cramer.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.453 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
having me, Emery.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You have shared that there's
an intergalactic space station

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:90%
on Jupiter.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
What more can you
tell us about that?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's, like, one of my
favorite places that I've ever

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:90%
been.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:10%
So a intergalactic trade
commission of some kind

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:10%
is responsible for the
construction, maintenance,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:10%
and operation of the station,
as well as similar stations

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.410 align:middle line:10%
like it around the galaxy.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially, a
neutral ground meeting place.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So that any group, any species,
any military representative,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
diplomatic
representative who wants

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to meet with someone else from
somewhere else can go there.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Have a conversation in a
completely secure, safe place

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:84%
where weird things, squirrely
things don't happen there.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a neutral zone?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.898 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a neutral zone.

00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I was often-- the
reason I got to go

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
on these missions
was because I was

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.545 align:middle line:84%
the only pilot with
infantry experience

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:90%
when I was on the Nautilus.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And these ambassadorial
teams would come through

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:90%
from the diplomatic corps.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
just in case guy.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.273 align:middle line:84%
And I was never needed
for anything just in case

00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
complete, neutral zone.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.212 align:middle line:90%
But you know how we are.

00:01:34.212 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
We get paranoid
and we like to have

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
someone in a fight in
case something happens.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically brought along
for a completely superfluous

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
purpose that I never had to
be there for that purpose.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So I basically just got to sit
there at these conversations.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.917 align:middle line:90%
So the main room itself--

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
actually, let me see
if I can describe this.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Now this is in
space or on the planet?

00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it is orbiting Jupiter.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So at quite a distance,
Jupiter's a very large planet.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So the goal is for
the space station

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:84%
to be in a stable
orbit, but not to be

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:90%
affected by the gravity pull.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Because Jupiter is
a very large body

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
so there's a pretty
good gravity pull on it.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's a multi-level station.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
But the top level is
this giant glass room

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that's almost a
mile in diameter,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
with floor to ceiling windows
that are probably over 80 feet.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Now I call them windows,
but I'm sure they're not

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:90%
made of silicone glass.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
They're probably made out
of some kind of polycarbon

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
incredible view of Jupiter.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The photographs do
not do it justice.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.467 align:middle line:84%
Being able to actually
see it there in person,

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
it's an absolutely
gorgeous sight to behold.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it different than
what we see from, like,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:90%
on TV and the media?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.105 align:middle line:90%
>> The colors are richer.

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
That's really the
best thing I can say.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.043 align:middle line:84%
Is that if I look
at a photograph

00:02:53.043 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking
at the real thing,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
the real thing is
just much more vivid.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
The colors are much
more pronounced.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can see more detail
than you can in a photograph,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
even though a photograph
looks amazing.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
The in-person experience
is way more amazing

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:90%
than a photograph could ever be.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Now inside, is it seamless?

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Is it all squared off?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it curved?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a round room, so
it's completely curved.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:84%
The interior of the
room is a basically,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as a giant flat
room, like a giant open space.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
That has hard light
holograms that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
can produce conversational
environments,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:90%
as they call them.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So a conversational environment
can be as simple as a table

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:90%
with chairs on either side.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Or depending on any
specific environmental needs

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that someone may need,
you could have a table

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
with chairs in one side
and maybe a large cube

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
table with a different gaseous

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
or even aqueous environment,
if the species in question

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:90%
has to function there.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Beings come there in
environment suits.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:90%
They can teleport sometimes.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.978 align:middle line:84%
So it's kept in an
oxygen-rich environment

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
because it turns
out, there are a lot

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
of species that breathe
oxygen. It's not universal,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
but there are a lot of them.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So it creates these hard light
conversational environments

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:90%
all over the room.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
I've never been
in that room when

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
there were less than several
hundred conversations going

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:90%
on at any given time.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is like
a mile in diameter.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely huge.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
The smallest species
that I've ever

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
seen in this room having a
conversation with someone

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:90%
was probably about that tall.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Largest species I've
ever seen in this room

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:90%
was closer to 60-65 feet tall.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they look like?

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Humanoid, actually.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that they are
actually a near genetic match

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
to our own human biological
genetic structure,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
except that their
planet is much larger

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:90%
and so their scale is different.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But somehow there is
this bio-genetic link.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Which I've been informed
can happen for two reasons.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
One, there may be a
common biological ancestor

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
or a common biological
manipulator of that species,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
since we know that there
are advanced species that

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
go around manipulating planets
and genetics of species

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
all over the place and
leave their fingerprints

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:90%
behind all the time.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It also turns out that
for some unknown reason,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:90%
the universe replicates success.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.028 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible to find
a biological species

00:05:37.028 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
on a planet that's at the
other end of the galaxy

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
or even in another galaxy
that's such a close match,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
but with no common
ancestor whatsoever.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And the only conclusion
that our best scientists

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
can come up with is that nature
replicates successful patterns.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And that, somehow,
nature decided well,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a successful pattern
way over here somewhere,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
we're just going to
evolve that pattern here.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if that's
morphogenic fields or something

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not my area.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I've noticed throughout
my experience that most

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
of the beings have the
five-pointed star-- two arms,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:90%
two legs, and a head.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, the races are
just completely different.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice, like
with his tall being that

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
was 60 plus feet, here
on Earth, we have humans,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:90%
but our races are different.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:90%
We look very different.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice this
on this space station?

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an
incredible variance.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So you certainly see
a two arms, two legs,

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
bipedal biological
representation a lot.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But there's
variations there, too.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So it really depends on
environmental conditions

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and who was tinkering
with the genetics of that

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:90%
species to get them going.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, some of
the progenitor species

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
who go around
tinkering with people

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
have an agenda to create
some similarities-- two

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:90%
arms, two legs, et cetera.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
What about the space
station itself?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Like, who built it and why?

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It was constructed by some
sort of intergalactic commerce

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:90%
association.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what their
actual tag line is,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:90%
but they're responsible.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Essentially just for
creating an environment

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.630 align:middle line:84%
for positive commerce
around the known universe.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So whenever
possible, they create

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
these stations, these
environments for people

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
to come and have conversations
to essentially, benefit

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the flow of commerce in the
galaxy and the known universe.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> When actually was it built?

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And who runs it?

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:90%
Was it humans?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's run
by this consortium

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials,
the commerce association.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe, it was
built around 1979-1980.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Did we here--

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
our humans from Earth-- have
any assistance with that?

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.608 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they may have hired
some contractors and we may

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.150 align:middle line:84%
have shown up to do
some of the work.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But this is something that
they're pretty familiar with.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And for the most
part, these stations

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
are constructed somewhere
else and then either towed in

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:90%
or jumpgated in.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And who's on this
board that constructed it?

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Is it just humans?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Or ETs?

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Or And where are they from?

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a consortium of
extraterrestrials from all

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:90%
over.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding is
the commerce committee,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, is
hundreds, hundreds

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:84%
of species that are represented
there and participate

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:84%
in that process of
just, again, how

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to create a better
environment for everyone

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
to engage in commerce.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think they
placed it outside of Jupiter?

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:90%
Why not somewhere else?

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked someone
about that, actually.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was told because it
was the easiest landmark.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you're telling
someone from a ways

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:84%
away how to get to the space
station in the Sol system,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
you go oh, yeah, it's that big
dead gas giant in the middle,

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%
it's right next to that.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's just the biggest
landmark, basically,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%
to point to.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>> The biggest planet out here.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Just meet us there.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, biggest landmark.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you actually
board this thing?

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
your craft near it?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Or do you get near it?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.487 align:middle line:90%
Or do you take a wormhole?

00:09:03.487 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Or how does it work?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> This was, pretty much, when
I was on the Nautilus that this

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:90%
would happen.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So the Nautilus would
have these teams

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:90%
from the diplomatic corps.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We would come into a safe
range from the station,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
which is usually only
a couple miles out.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.122 align:middle line:84%
And then we would take
a shuttle in and land

00:09:17.122 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:90%
and then come back out.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.592 align:middle line:84%
They do have a jumpgate
system, but something

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
about the technology
that they were

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.057 align:middle line:84%
using that we preferred to take
a shuttle there instead of use

00:09:26.057 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:90%
their jumpgate tech.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure why.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Now as you're approaching
this gigantic space station,

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:90%
what does it look like?

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:84%
What's the actual--
you kind of went

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.642 align:middle line:84%
over the dimensions a
little bit, but is it

00:09:37.642 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
something that would look for
in to someone here on Earth?

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly got
some sci-fi look to it.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not white, or
silver, or shiny metallic.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It's actually done in
tones that are sort of

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:90%
in red tones and orange tones.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
There's like a paint job
on the outside of it.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.867 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually with
some running lights.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of pretty, actually,
when you get close to it.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
You're like oh, that's pretty.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you could
stare at it for a while,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
just appreciating the
aesthetic quality of it.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> What exact shape is this?

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It actually looks kind
of like a giant bell.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So the dome is like
the top part and then

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.523 align:middle line:84%
it flares out a
little bit underneath.

00:10:19.523 --> 00:10:21.107 align:middle line:84%
And then it has kind
of a flat bottom.

00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of shaped
like a giant bell.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.835 align:middle line:84%
>> And how does the
gravity work in there?

00:10:24.835 --> 00:10:25.635 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:10:25.635 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> They have their own
artificial gravity plating

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that's adjustable.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So again, depending on where the
species in question may be from

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and what their
comfort level may be

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
will depend on what the actual
gravity plating adjustment

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
under that conversational
environment would be set at.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Every species has
a different density,

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.583 align:middle line:84%
has a different environment, and
it actually forms around them

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:90%
is what you were telling me.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> They create an environment
that is suitable for that

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It is also true, though,
that some species will come

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:90%
in their own environment suit.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So you may be sitting at
a table with someone who

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
is in an environment
suit, which has

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
got their own gaseous or liquid
environment inside the suit

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:90%
that they're maintaining.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So how would a species
walk through here that is from

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:90%
an aqueous state?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Does that force field
just follow them

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
around everywhere and
they're enclosed in it?

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It depends.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
More often than not,
those situations,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
the conversational
environment is established.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the species
in question will

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.172 align:middle line:84%
jumpgate right into the
conversational environment,

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:90%
from their environment.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So from one aqueous to
another aqueous environment.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:84%
With a jumpgate,
it's not like water

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:84%
comes flooding
through the other end

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
from one stable aqueous

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
environment to another
stable aqueous environment.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Now are you in a suit
when you're visiting this?

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Or you're just walking around
in your normal clothes?

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> No we we're in just
sort of standard uniform.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:84%
There were occasional
meetings that we

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.892 align:middle line:84%
would have that were a little
more ceremonial, diplomatic,

00:12:02.892 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
like the signing of a treaty
or something in which we

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
would go in dress uniforms.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, we would just
go in standard uniform.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Was there someplace to eat?

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the cafeteria.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> No, there was no food.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly enough,
because of so many

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
different eating habits of
so many different species,

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
you never know when you
might really offend someone

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:90%
by what you're eating.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.195 align:middle line:84%
Because you may eat
something that they

00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:28.570 align:middle line:84%
consider a friend, or a
relative, or something

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's very awkward.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no food.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:90%
However, there is drinks.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Usually water and/or
mostly fruit drinks.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:90%
No alcoholic beverages.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:90%
No intoxicants.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Just refreshing drinks.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:90%
No caffeinated drinks.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:90%
No alcohol.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Just basically, water
and fruit juices.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So how big are these
glasses for the giants?

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I watched a giant drinking
out of something that was about

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
the size of a trash can that
he could get his hand around

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and drink out of.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a little surreal,
to be honest with you.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen somebody drink
something that's that big.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Just take it up in one hand.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So how did they sustain it?

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there like a
maintenance crew?

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Who's cleaning up the mess
when the giant drops the trash

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:90%
can full of blueberry juice?

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The cleaning crew are robots.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
They have little robots that
do most of the cleaning.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.272 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, they
have a staff that

00:13:22.272 --> 00:13:23.480 align:middle line:90%
takes care of all that stuff.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:90%
We hardly ever see them.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're mostly doing
that work when no one's looking

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:90%
or when no one's there.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> How advanced were these
robots that you saw working

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of them roll along
the floor and basically,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:90%
are picking up things.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Sucking them up like a vacuum
cleaner or a little hands

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.153 align:middle line:84%
come out and they pick up things
and put it in a receptacle

00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:84%
on the top or
something like that.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So they're just little
functional cleaning robots.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I want one.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, is there a security
profile system that you have

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:84%
to walk through and they
check your baggage or anything

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:90%
similar to that?

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Or are you allowed to
bring your pets with you?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Are you allowed to bring
your suitcases with you?

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you get a chance
to stay there?

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a limited time
that you're only there?

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.333 align:middle line:84%
>> We're only there for the
time of the meeting itself.

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So when the shuttle comes in
and docks in the shuttle bay,

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.990 align:middle line:84%
there's a deacon chamber
where everyone walks into it.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Doors at both end close.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Some ultraviolet lights
and some other things

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:84%
happen and you feel your skin
tingle for a few seconds.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.132 align:middle line:84%
And then, the door at
the other end opens up

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:90%
and you're let through.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.317 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they just do
a clean scan for everybody

00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
you're not carrying

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
weapons, contraband, or
harmful bacteria, or viruses,

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they have their
own police force on this,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.640 align:middle line:90%
the security force?

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They have a security
force, but again,

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
this is an environment where
everyone wants to play nice.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to get banned from
being able to hang out and have

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:90%
conversations.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:90%
So everyone behaves themselves.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever heard of the
station becoming under attack?

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Never.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Never, ever, ever.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do you get around
on this 1 mile diameter?

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Is there some way
to transport around?

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Do you get escorted around?

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You can get
escorted, but you walk.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a little
line will show up

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, will show you
exactly where you're going.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can sometimes have
someone walk you there.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But everyone's-- nothing's
ever happening where someone

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:84%
somewhere is not looking
at what you're doing.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Whether there's a camera
or a scanner or something.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're always
being watched over.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So whether someone's
escorting you personally

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.293 align:middle line:84%
or whether they just tell you
to follow the yellow line,

00:15:34.293 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:90%
you're always being watched.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Are your vital signs being
monitored while you're in here

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:90%
and your DNA frequency?

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that our own people
on the ship are doing a full

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:90%
monitor on everyone.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.997 align:middle line:84%
We've got earpieces
so people on the ship

00:15:46.997 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:90%
can talk to you if they need to.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:90%
They're monitoring your vitals.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Monitoring the
surrounding atmosphere.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Monitoring other species.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Just because we like to always
keep your eyeballs open.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And the various species,
you mentioned a few--

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:84%
a large one and a
small one-- is there

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
any other you can elaborate that
really stand out in your mind,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:90%
that you thought were amazing?

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they were actually in
their own special atmosphere

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't used to seeing,
maybe a plasma field of some

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:90%
sort?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So I do remember having this
very interesting conversation

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:90%
with an amphibious species.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
From their physical
appearance, I

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
would probably think
that they evolved

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
from some kind of aquatic frog,
as opposed to a tree frog.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Which I have met species that
are evolved from tree frogs,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:84%
which are different from those
evolved from an aqueous frog.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So this one, I'm pretty sure,
was from an aqueous frog

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.248 align:middle line:84%
because they had an
environment suit that

00:16:43.248 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:90%
was actually filled with water.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you're
sitting across the table

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
from someone in an
environment space suit,

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.677 align:middle line:84%
but instead of there being
air on the other side,

00:16:53.677 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:90%
they're in a liquid environment.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking through
a system that is then

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
communicated to the translator
in front that then communicates

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.487 align:middle line:84%
But that was one of the more
surreal things I've ever seen

00:17:05.487 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
was basically, a frog
person in an environment

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:90%
suit filled with water.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So that they could be in an
air environment, an oxygen

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Which is the opposite
of wearing a scuba suit.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting to me.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm fascinated by that.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, as
you know in the projects,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
we had special environmental
chambers for them to stay in.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were dolphin
people, or frog people,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
or maybe come from a
hot molten lava place.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was very interesting
for me to find out,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
how do they walk
amongst us utilizing

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
these personal atmosphere
suits, is what we call them?

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
What challenges have you
ever encountered while

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:90%
at the station?

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The number one challenge
of being there is actually,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
your brain's pattern recognition
system trying to keep up with

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
all the patterns that
you're looking at.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So if I can try
and explain that.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Here on planet Earth,
when you're looking around

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
at other human beings,
even though everyone

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:84%
has their own unique
appearance, you're

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:84%
still looking at people
that have a similar flesh.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Have two hands,
two legs, two eyes,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
a similar pattern recognition
of a facial structure.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So that you're
pattern recognition

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
isn't having to work
overtime because it's

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
looking at things
through a pattern

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
that it's accustomed to.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're in a room
where there are dozens or even

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.630 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of other
species, you're

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
pattern recognition in
your brain goes on overload

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and it's working overtime.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Every time you glance
around and you're

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
looking at something
different and your brain

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
is attempting to decode that
what you're seeing based

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:90%
on the pattern recognition.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:84%
It can cause migraines,
headaches, dizziness,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:90%
blurred vision.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
There are times when
you can look at someone

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see them clearly
because your brain is literally

00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
having an overload attempt
to recognize everything

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
in the pattern.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And it can't decode
the image properly.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you literally
will see blurred vision

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:90%
of someone coming at you.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.275 align:middle line:84%
Or even weirder, which has
happened once or twice, where

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
your brain will just
go, you know what?

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't even try to decode this.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to pull something
from the memory banks

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going to
project it out here.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's what
you're going to see.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So there was a time when a
diplomatic group was walking

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:84%
past a table that
we were sitting at

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and I remember turning and my
eyes got all wide as saucers.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel sitting next to
me was like what did you see?

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
no, no, no, you didn't see
what you were looking at.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:90%
But what did you see?

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was like scarecrow
from the Wizard of Oz?

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was like OK,
yeah, and he laughed.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, sometimes
I see Muhammad Ali or my aunt

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Tilly.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:84%
He's like so your brain will, if
it can't figure something out,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.445 align:middle line:90%
it will just go ah, screw it.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Then will just pull
something out and project

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that image over what
you're looking at.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably
the biggest challenge.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we would have to
arrive there and stop near

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
the entrance of
the room and sit--

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
there's these padded
benches sitting there--

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and literally wait for your
brain and your eyes to adjust.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Which is a combination of
basically, sitting, looking up,

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.220 align:middle line:84%
you scan around the room
until your head hurts,

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and then you stare at the floor
until your head stops hurting.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you look up and
you look around again,

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
until your head start hurting,
then you stare at the floor.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.565 align:middle line:84%
And after about
15 or 20 minutes,

00:20:24.565 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
you get to where
you can actually

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.312 align:middle line:84%
get up and walk somewhere
without your head feeling

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
like you're going to have
a splitting headache.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
But you learn to also not
just keep looking around.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
you look around,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the more you're stressing
out that pattern recognition

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So I can remember very
specific images of these events

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and the species that were
there, but I'll admit,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I'll pull up
a picture in my head

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.987 align:middle line:84%
and there's just a
lot of blurry spots.

00:20:49.987 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
That my brain just goes, yeah,
I'm not sure what to put there.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.973 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what do with that.

00:20:53.973 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably
the biggest challenge

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is your brain's pattern
recognition basically feeling

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:84%
like it's completely
overwhelmed and almost incapable

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of being able to process
all the different shapes

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that your brain is
trying to process.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting you say
that because I have a little

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:84%
experience with that
in the projects,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:84%
when they were debriefing us
before we met any type of other

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:90%
That here's a picture.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Here's a video.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:90%
This is how they are.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:90%
This how they look like.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Be prepared for that.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Also, the customs behind
how not to look at them.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.832 align:middle line:90%
How not to smile, maybe.

00:21:29.832 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone has a
different-- some people,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:90%
of course, they don't speak.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
This is all telepathy
and facial expressions.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
looking at a face

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
that you've actually
never seen before,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to judge like
what they're feeling.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to
go through that.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any
debriefing before you

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
went on of all the species
you were going to either meet?

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Did they tell you
about the customs?

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:90%
What to say, what not to say?

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
What not to think,
what to think?

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:90%
And how to hide that?

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So fortunately
or unfortunately,

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
probably unfortunately, I didn't
get like a really good proper

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:90%
briefing like that.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
is I would end up

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
on the shuttle with
the diplomatic corps.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.655 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, what
are we doing today?

00:22:12.655 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the
ambassador would say

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:90%
here's what we're doing today.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.335 align:middle line:84%
And then he would basically,
give me a verbal brief

00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:90%
on the shuttle on the way over.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And he had a tablet he could
pull up and show pictures

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And say OK, don't shake hands
or shake with your left hand,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:90%
not with your right hand.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.297 align:middle line:84%
Make eye contact when
you first meet, but then,

00:22:29.297 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:84%
after that, if someone's
not addressing you,

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.255 align:middle line:84%
don't look them in the eye
because it's a challenge

00:22:33.255 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:90%
gesture.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There are different things
that you have to be aware of.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I would get a
little brief on that.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I never really
screwed that up.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
There were times
when I was tempted

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.700 align:middle line:84%
to do something that would
have screwed that up,

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:90%
but I stopped myself.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it was
interesting to notice

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:84%
all these different customs that
and sometimes, they're similar.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
They're really similar
to things that we have,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes to the 180-degree
opposite of what we do.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And other times, they have
no comparison to anything

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes those conversations
are the weirdest

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:84%
because you have very strange
rules that you have to follow.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:90%
But there's also protocols.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't usually
walk across the room

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and then go, oh,
hey, how you doing?

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And have a conversation with
someone that you walk past.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Or someone-- there
are protocols.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So there were a
couple of times when

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:84%
we were there and having
a conversation at a table,

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and someone nearby clearly
was interested in also

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:90%
having a conversation.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And someone would walk over
and have a little chit chat

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:90%
and then come back.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So it did happen occasionally,
but it was fairly rare.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever seen any type
of devices or technology that

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
was relevant to anything you've
seen here on planet Earth?

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the more interesting
things that happened is I was

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:84%
having a conversation with
someone and he reached into his

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:90%
pocket--

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
he was quite a bit larger than
I was, about 25 feet tall--

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:84%
reached into his
pocket and pulled out

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.612 align:middle line:84%
what initially looked
like a playing card.

00:24:00.612 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
He held it up to me
really, really close.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked
at it, at first, I

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
thought I was looking
at a face card.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, oh,
that's not a face card.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.355 align:middle line:90%
That's a person.

00:24:10.355 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's a person
who's moving.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I realized he was handing
me a telecom screen

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.695 align:middle line:84%
so that I could have a
conversation with this person.

00:24:17.695 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And he just pulled it
out and handed it to me

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and it was about that
thick and about that big.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.182 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the most
amazing things I've seen.

00:24:27.182 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Because apparently, the
person on the other end

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.598 align:middle line:84%
was at the other
end of the galaxy.

00:24:30.598 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't even someone
who was close by.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It was someone who was
an incredible distance.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, they're
able to establish

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.337 align:middle line:84%
audio, video, communications
via some tiny little device

00:24:41.337 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:90%
that you're able to have--

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> No line of sight.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:90%
It's through infra-space.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, yeah,
something like that.

00:24:47.363 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, are there any like
force fields around the space

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
station that protect it, just
in case something would happen

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
or they did not
want someone aboard?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yes.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that made of?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:90%
What's the science behind that?

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Not 100% sure.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
is there are layers

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
of shielding that they
have around the station.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So there are shielding
that comes out quite a bit

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, there's
a camouflaging field

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:84%
so you can't even see it
until you're 10 miles away.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:90%
So once--

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can't see it from
here with a telescope.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Nope, you wouldn't be able to
see it again until you're about

00:25:20.047 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
10 miles away.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
layers as you get closer.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We would have to come
in and get clearance.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
As we would come in, come
into a parking position,

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and then get clearance
to bring the shuttle in.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The pilots of the shuttles
seem to be looking at something

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
on their scanner so that
these layers of shielding

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:84%
would have to be
turned off and turned

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.665 align:middle line:84%
back on, again, like gates
as you approach the station.

00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's pretty
tight security.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the trade
cooperation with Jupiter?

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there any hope
for us here on Earth

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:90%
that we'll be part of that?

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we are.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why we got invited to
come to the space station,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:84%
to be invited to be a part
of the intergalactic chamber

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.130 align:middle line:90%
of commerce.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean in a 3D right
now or in another field,

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.040 align:middle line:90%
another dimension?

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here, 3D right now.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So who's in charge
of that here on Earth?

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't have that person's
name or know who that person

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.120 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And if I did, I
wouldn't be able to say.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you say the
organization or the corporation

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:90%
involved?

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Or is that also--

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I would suggest that it would
be a senior executive for one

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
of the top three global
banking organizations,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:90%
without naming names.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not government,
it's not military.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The diplomatic corps is
a military organization.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And they do almost all
of the negotiations,

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:90%
all of the communications.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:84%
All of the meetings are handled
be via the diplomatic corps.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:84%
But the people
behind that who are

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
making that happen, and
putting up the money,

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
authorize those people to

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:84%
concede or offer things
in a negotiated contract.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's still the
people with the money--

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
still the bankers who get
to decide how that happens

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:03.885 align:middle line:90%
and for what purpose.

00:27:03.885 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So just like, now it's
still corporate that runs

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:84%
the government and military,
that makes the decisions

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.688 align:middle line:90%
for this adventure.

00:27:10.688 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I wouldn't
say that that's accurate.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I would say that when
it comes to commerce,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
the bankers have a major part
of the decision making process

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:90%
and how that goes about.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:84%
However, the military, in
many ways, has the final say.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if it violates security,
if it makes us not safe,

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:84%
if we determine that it is
militarily risky or dangerous,

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the military can say no,
that's not going to happen.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.680 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to do that.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we put
ourselves in that position.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So that we would have
that veto power to say no,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
this may be good for
your bank accounts.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
This won't be good
for our security.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.198 align:middle line:84%
So we have to come up
with a compromise that

00:27:52.198 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:84%
doesn't compromise security
and gets you what you want.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So the military isn't
kowtowing to those people.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially taking the
position as a middle person

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they
can still do their job

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and maintain
intra-solar planetary

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.827 align:middle line:84%
security, while
protecting commerce.

00:28:08.827 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
The military has protected
commerce for centuries.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're still
protecting commerce.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:16.025 align:middle line:84%
But the bankers don't
get to tell us what we do

00:28:16.025 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:90%
and what we don't do.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
That's still a
military decision,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
decided by military senior
officials and senior officers.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these three major
bankers, we'll say,

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:90%
are they human?

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And are they
controlled by anyone else?

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Not that I'm aware of.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Their main motivation
is commerce.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:90%
It's greed.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Which we like to think
that we can utilize that

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
in a healthy way
as long as we curb

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:90%
the unhealthy elements of that.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is that
trade going on?

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:90%
What are we trading?

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything and
everything that we have.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And anything and
everything that we need.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it that it's so
important that they have that?

00:28:54.610 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it just something that they
can't acquire on their own?

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's always a cost
benefit analysis of anything

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that anybody in any world
does and trades in or uses

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:90%
as a resource.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's minerals,
whether it's raw materials,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's machine parts,
whether it's engines,

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:84%
whether it's electronic
parts, there's

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
a cost benefit ratio
for those things.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, there are simply certain
things that different species

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:84%
based on the resources that
they have to work with,

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that the cost of those
things is far less than what

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:90%
it costs us to make them.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Or in the opposite direction,
things that we make,

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:41.408 align:middle line:84%
it's simply more cost effective
for someone to buy it from us

00:29:41.408 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:90%
than it is for them to make it.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it would cost more
if they made it themselves.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
commerce is all about.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I have a surplus of this and
it costs $0.50 on the dollar.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So you might as well
buy some of that

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's cost
effective for you.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And you have a surplus
of this mineral that

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
is pennies on the dollar
to what it would normally

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.150 align:middle line:90%
cost us if we mined it.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's cheaper if we buy it
from you than if we bust it out

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.715 align:middle line:90%
of the rocks ourselves.

00:30:09.715 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's just what
commerce is always about.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.603 align:middle line:84%
There's always some
way of looking at,

00:30:15.603 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
can we get that
somewhere cheaper?

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Can we get a better product for
less money from somebody else?

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:84%
That is the fundamental
basis of all trade.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, fascinating Randy.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's always an enjoyment
to have you on the show.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, again.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:90%

was the product

of Arthurian people.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first Atlantis
was not about pyramids.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:90%
It was about the temple within.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:84%
They taught us how to
relate with the world.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Giants were the keepers of that
wisdom and that information.
