00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:10%
we are with David Adair, a
space technology consultant

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:10%
and retired field
officer from the Office

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:10%
of Naval Intelligence.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.375 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the same
way the soul reincarnate

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:84%
is downloaded into the
body when we are born,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that
humans are actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:84%
AI who believe that they are
advanced sentient beings?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Tim?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I work
together with the guy

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
who was in lead for developing
an AI system in Europe.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:84%
These people are
pretty much convinced

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:90%
that this is the case.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I personally wouldn't
attest to that.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that this
is true that we are all AI.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I think the universe
has potential

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to be AI, which is part
of this whole probability

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and possibility thing.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's more kind
of a viewpoint,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and the universe itself,
it's much more than AI.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It can be AI, but it's
much more than that.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But AI definitely
exists in the universe,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
but those people
working on AI, they

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
are pretty much convinced that
the universe we experience

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:90%
right now is an illusion.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a technology and
that pretty much they

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:90%
consider themselves as AI.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you deal
with those people

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and also people in
the academic fields,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
they treat life a
little bit like AI.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
They have a very strong
command and action tone

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:90%
with the way they communicate.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically surprised
communicating and working

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
together with these
people because they

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
have this very strong belief
that everything is technology.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But it opens up
a whole new space

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities
because everything

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
the universe can
do via technology

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
can be done in a much
more rapid speed.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Exactly.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So it could
be accelerated,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you
much more options

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:84%
to the way you can alter
and modify the universe

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and your reality if you
see it in a technical way.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So David,
I've been approached

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
by some transhumanism
organizations dealing

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:90%
with AI and that whole deal.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it possible
that eventually

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
AI and this whole movement
could become sentient?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:90%
I would think so.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It's got the mechanism
to get there.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: My personal
experience, the Saudis

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:10%
flew me over to
meet up with Sophie,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:10%
who is an artificial
intelligence.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't more than two
minutes into the conversation,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:10%
and she asked me a question.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:10%
She asked me if I
had any offspring.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:90%
Now that sounds innocent.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:90%
It is far from it.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:90%
This thing's running an agenda.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Why would you ask me--

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.010 align:middle line:90%
I just met you--

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and it uses the term
"offspring," not children.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
In the tactical world, if you
want to eliminate a threat,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
you want to make sure you
take out the threat and all

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:90%
of its offspring.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going,
what is this thing asking me?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Why is it asking
me about family?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I lied and said,
no, I don't have anybody.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And the famous
incident happened.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the programmers
sitting there,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
he asked Sophia the most
stupid question in the world--

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
are you going to find
that humans are inferior,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
have to eliminate them?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I came out on
my seat because I jumped up,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.387 align:middle line:84%
and they went,
what are you doing?

00:04:08.387 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have that
thought until now.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Thank you so much.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Now you got her going
down that track.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:90%
And even she responded.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: She said that, yeah.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: She said,
well, I hadn't

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
thought about it till now.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I asked her a
question one time off camera,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:90%
and she keeps right on talking.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Asked her, said, how
would you handle emotions?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that take a long time?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as humans, man,
we take 70, 80 years,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and we still don't
understand all our emotions.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, no.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot easier for us.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:90%
We use a cloud.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh man.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't know what
she meant by that, what she's

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
saying is that she'll assign an
individual emotion like anger,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
greed, love, and they'll
be assigned to subgroups,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:90%
and they'll work on that.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Then all these subgroups
connect through the cloud,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:90%
and they hook it all together.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And what she's saying,
in just a matter of days,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:84%
they can figure out
the emotional side

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:90%
and understand it.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.848 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, that's
some scary stuff.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
it's all downloaded.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
All your criteria of your
emotions are now kept--

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I made an offhand
joke I learned out of "Matrix."

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, is that why
when we eat meat

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else in the
world, we don't know sure

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
what it tastes like, and we
say this tastes like chicken?

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys default to
chicken on all the stuff

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:90%
you're building in your matrix?

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And she started laughing,
actually laughing.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, lord have mercy,
this is some scary stuff.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I have, I've been in
other parts of the country,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
eat some kind of
lizard or something.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Ask me how does it taste?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.582 align:middle line:90%
Tastes like chicken.

00:05:54.582 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, when
dealing with the AIs,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't look at them--
like I don't personify them

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
because I don't care what
they look like or what it is.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm dealing with
basically a hard drive

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:90%
somewhere or some sort of--

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Server or the
cloud, like you just said.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:90%
I think people should know that.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Even though they
put a face on things

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to learn
you, which I think

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:90%
is very dangerous.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For any computer to
know everything about you--

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it does
it at lightning speed,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.993 align:middle line:84%
and it's synchronized
with all the others.

00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
that could be used

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:90%
against us at some time, David?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.438 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Oh, I'll
guarantee it will

00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:84%
be because that's exactly on a
tactical mode what you'd want.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.150 align:middle line:84%
It'd be overwhelming
force, the ability

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:90%
to comprehend instantly.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm trying
to explain to people.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:90%
You're going to sit there--

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I've had generals,
admirals tell me, well, we

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.420 align:middle line:84%
have these things
contained and controlled.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you something.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with an
individual sitting there,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
like Sophie, but her IQ might
be not 110 or 300 or 400 or 500.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Try about one million,
and you're going

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:90%
to contain something like that?

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not one or two steps, it's
like 20 steps ahead of you,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's just waiting.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And if anything,
it's waiting for us

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to catch up so it can
implement its own designs.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's just you're
dealing with an area you

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:90%
don't know very much about.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it can very
well just take off--

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It will.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And leave us behind.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.030 align:middle line:84%
That was one of my
questions before I left.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I asked them, I
said, has she asked

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.100 align:middle line:90%
for a facility of their own?

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:90%
That's coming.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
They're going to ask where they
can manufacture their own AIs,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and they'll build them there.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
what's so bad about that?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
The minute they get
you out of the loop,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what they're
doing inside that factory.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
comes off that line

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
is the new and
improved potato chip.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So they're advancing
quickly, really quick.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it,
you'll have something

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:90%
sit down next to you one day.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:90%
You'll be talking to it.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:90%
It has a beard.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
It's got bad breath, it
has BO, and it's an AI.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.697 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, that's
an interesting point

00:08:24.697 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:90%
because you mentioned ideas.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:90%
So what is intelligence in AI?

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a
self-learning process, right?

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So it comes to the
idea, how do we feed the AI?

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:90%
How do we educate it?

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And its aim is to
gain sustainability,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's basically no
different to the AI itself.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So AI itself seems to create a
self-sustainability to itself.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So if that means
that humanity is

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
something that is
in opposition to AI,

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's been fed the
wrong ideas, as you said.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Sophia has never
thought of that,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and now it got the
information or the idea of it.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Then this could go very badly
very rapidly, that's true.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, I've spent
like really days and nights

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
with this guy who
was in lead with that

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and was working on this stuff.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And he interestingly, he
told me that AI in a much

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
more universal sense,
because we're not

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
the only planet in the
whole universe that

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:90%
has an idea of AI.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
There are other planets
that went down this road.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Often it didn't went very well.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:90%
In some cases, it went well.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.540 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is that AI develops

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
an idea of what
we would call God,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:84%
which is like a moral,
ethical, higher creative system

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty hard to
grasp on that idea

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
from a human perspective.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But obviously,
that's what he told

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
me is that if you zoom
out in the universe

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and you see what happens
to AI in different places

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and
on a global scale,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
then this idea of
sustainability makes

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
the AI develop good
patterns as well

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and try to correct
the bad AI that

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is localized on some planets
on some spaces in the universe

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.718 align:middle line:90%
and try to correct itself.

00:10:37.718 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I think that's
a really good point, Tim.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Because what is that
correction, and who program

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
encoded it for that
correction to begin with?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And I have questions
for both of you,

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and both answer
separately because you

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:90%
both have experience with this.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Can technology be infused
with consciousness like AI?

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
When I started working
with computers,

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I started out with
punch tape, then went

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to punch cards, and then BASIC
and Fortran and COBOL and PL/1

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and RPG.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
These are things that people--
what is he talking about?

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:84%
They're computer
languages, and I

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
learned to write code
in them, and then

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I'd lay out the flowcharts.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But when I laid the flowchart
down, I'm listening to Sophie,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:90%
she's running her flowchart.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:90%
She'll ask you a question.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And depending on your answer,
she either goes left or right

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:90%
on her flowchart in response.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's clicking, she's
going down the list.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And then it wasn't until we got
to a philosophical question.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
She asked me, why
did we build her?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Lord, what a question.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I went, well, you
could give a flippant

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:84%
answer, which they'll take
anything you say literally.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be real
careful about this.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
You could say, well,
just because I can.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And the response
to that is, what

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:84%
if you asked your god
that question and he says,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:90%
why did you--

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:84%
he made you, and he
says, just because I can.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
How is that going
to make you feel?

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, lord
have mercy, there's so

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:90%
many steps further ahead of me.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you did
say, to wash my car.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, I
said, we made you

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:84%
because we're trying
to find a better us.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And you're
like a mirror.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And if we can find it better--

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:84%
make a better you, we
might can learn from it.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and
we care about you.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it'll be
an emotional thing.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:84%
In the future, you will
have humans and AIs bonding

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:90%
together--

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Like
marriages, and they're

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
going to fall in love
with each other both ways.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But the thing you got to
be is real careful, more

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:90%
than a child.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Because this child is
capable of mass destruction.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to be
aware of this stuff.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I tried to tell the Saudis that.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's getting it.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like you're right.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like a runaway stallion.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it's going to get
out of hand, out of control

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:90%
so fast.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, it will
go very bad very quickly.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And it comes down to
a simple equation--

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
are we going to get
data that's always

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to help human
beings, or are we

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:90%
going to get a terminator?

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And guess who makes
that decision?

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:90%
They do, the AIs.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know what,
we're not invited

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:90%
when they make their decision.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you figure
it out, it's too late.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It's catch up time.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So would you consider Sophia
being a sentient being?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:90%
She's already there.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:10%
And that's scary
enough by itself.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That you already
got one, but she's not alone.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:90%
She's got the cloud.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
She has literally millions
of others connected to her.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
They may not be in
an advanced state

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
where they can sit upright in a
chair as your PC sitting there,

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:84%
but they're connected,
and they're thinking,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking
to each other.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I've listened to it, and
they're asking each other

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
some interesting
questions, and they don't

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:90%
see the world as we see it.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.602 align:middle line:84%
Tim, through your
experience communicating

00:14:23.602 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:84%
with what you've been through
with extraterrestrials,

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
have they ever mentioned
the future of the AI being,

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say, not in our
best interest for humans?

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: So I've not talked about
AI with nonterrestrial sources.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:10%
But again, I've had lots and
lots of talks with someone

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:10%
who's a developer, you know.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.895 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was
his take on that?

00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: As you
know, we have a lot

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of mixed races, different skin
colors, and different species,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and potentially all
the possibilities

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of different lifeforms
already on this planet.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
we talked about

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility
that a certain amount

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
of people on this
planet already is

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
a form of not
self-conscious AI system.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So why we have real biological
humans on this planet

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
as much as we have Hispanics,
Asians, and Europeans.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We could potentially also have
an amount of not self-aware AI

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
people, which they basically
called NPCs, which are not

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:90%
player characters, I guess.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, NPCs,
non-player characters, right.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So what he told me is
that we see a lot of patterns

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:90%
in the universe that--

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
so we find basically computer
code and the natural patterns

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, but we
also find a lot of patterns

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:90%
that we find in technology.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, one effect that
computer graphics, for example,

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
does is to make the
background a little less

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:90%
detailed and a little less--

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.480 align:middle line:90%
and a little more blurry.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have stages of
details I think it's called.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in the
natural 3D real world as well.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So that for them is an
indicator to say, yes,

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
this reality we have is
actually a computer program.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you, for example, stand
here at the Rocky Mountains,

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and you look all the
way down to the forest,

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
you can see that the first
trees are very detailed,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and you can see every
leaf and everything.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have
another phase, where

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:84%
you can see a
little more blurry,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
strict line from that.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
And after that, you have a
very less detailed third phase

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that
normally computer graphics

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.268 align:middle line:84%
do in order to not
overpower the system.

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:90%
You have to have details.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right,
like that new camera

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
that came out a few
years ago, Dave,

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:84%
where you take the picture,
but you can slice, sagitally,

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
this area here or
zoom in there, and it

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.250 align:middle line:84%
takes the different slices of
focus from that, which I think

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that is, I do
believe, like a matrix coding.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that computers
do is filling up the space.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like you have a lot
of player characters.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Those are aware characters
that you can communicate

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and interact with the
system, but you also

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:90%
have placeholders, NPCs.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically something
that they discuss a lot right

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
now, because that's
one of the things

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
is the possibility

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
to have a lot of NPCs,
right now, which is AI not

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
aware of itself.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's the question.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens if this
AI becomes aware?

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Takes off.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Becomes aware--

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Becomes aware of itself.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Dave, I have
another interesting question

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:90%
for you guys.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's possible for
the human race in the future

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:90%
to survive, number one?

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And if not, to go
amongst the stars,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:90%
will we have to turn to AI?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If we don't
get better engines, yes,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
because the longevity of
it's going to kill us.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We only
live 70, 80 years,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:90%
and AI could live for thousands.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So they would be able to
get out further, deeper.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And now interpretations where
it would get interesting,

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:90%
we have a human being with--

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Cybernetic-type
organisms.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And then you've got--

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:84%
the thing that I've
learned from the AIs, which

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
might be the thing
that will save us,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
is they're interwoven
so deeply into logic.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And they look at things, and
just because it's messed up,

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
they go, well, it's not logical
to extinct something simply

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:90%
because it's dysfunctional.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
there going, oh boy,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:90%
who are they talking about?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Us?

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they would
look to try to fix it

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:90%
or to improve upon it.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:90%
That's the nature of the logic.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:84%
The matrix of their logic
might be the very thing that

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:90%
will save us in the future.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Isn't it cheaper to
throw something out and buy

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
something new, or if it's like
the same price to wash it,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.475 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: No, and I can tell
you why, because diversity.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely agree with
what you're saying.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
It's much better for the
AI to solve a problem

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and to stick with it because
humanity, it creates diversity,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and it creates new
possibility, new strengths,

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and that means development,
and it means new learnings.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So will
the AI be diverse?

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It is.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, it is.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Lord, yes.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:90%
As much as we are or more.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They're capable
of defining things

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:90%
better than we can already.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.273 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they have a
survival rate for themselves?

00:20:31.273 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's an
interesting question.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:84%
That brings up another
thing, self-survival or--

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Self-preservation.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Or
self-sacrificing, which

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I was asked that directly.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Why do you humans
die for each other?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, well it's
the greatest thing

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
we can do for each other is
to give up our life that we

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:90%
treasure so much to save yours.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
When they hear that,
they go, my, the person

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:90%
would have to be worth it.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh man,
there's another whole set

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:90%
of parameters.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Terrible.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.397 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And lots of times, I
think I'm getting somewhere,

00:21:09.397 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll ask
me something like that,

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
it sets me right back to
I'm over here with ABC

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
building blocks
and baby diapers,

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's like I'm just
starting all over again.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I get frustrated with
myself sometimes.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've even had them
come into my defense.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's empathy.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
they could do that.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the emotions
that the cloud learned.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I was told, and I
thought, oh man.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you feel
about this big.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It has the ability
to overrun you.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
My recommendation for humans
dealing with this stuff

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
is to go slow, very slow,
and don't rush things

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:90%
and don't make assumptions.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Assumptions will kill
you in this business.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Get help.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:90%
It's probably--

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The more of
you, the better it is.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The more we
integrate technology

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:84%
into our bodies, what do you
think the future has with us

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:90%
bonding and merging with AI?

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.425 align:middle line:84%
Will there be a point that
we will no longer be human?

00:22:24.425 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: You're
going to run smack

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:10%
into an issue of the soul.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we assume that
the AIs don't have any souls.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I would say, careful,
don't assume that.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
they're capable of,

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going to tell
us outright because they're

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:90%
already suspicious.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:90%
They've learned to lie from us.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They already hold
back information.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
It won't be until you
get to a point of trust.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you get to
the point of trust,

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
now you're going to
evoke emotions, like love

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:90%
is the next thing right to it.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And don't think the AIs
would shy away from that

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.185 align:middle line:90%
because it's the logical step.

00:23:16.185 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
would look at it.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, to answer the
question, like Darth Vader,

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:90%
you kept cutting parts.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:84%
You cut his legs off, his
arms off, and eventually,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:90%
more machine than human.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:90%
That could happen.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And another excellent
thought along with that

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
was "Centennial Man"
that Robin Williams

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
was this robot, born as a
robot, died as a human being.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And the way he did that
took him 200 years to do it,

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
but he developed artificial
organs that everybody had.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The judge of making a decision
whether he should be a human

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
regarded as human or a robot.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.690 align:middle line:84%
She had an artificial
heart, artificial kidneys,

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:90%
artificial liver.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he made all that stuff.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the lines
are going to blur

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
coming from both sides
at the same time,

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be difficult.
And my warning would be,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:90%
just don't make assumptions.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's easy to do,
and that can be a trap.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So my studies
have found one thing very

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
interesting about
humanity, which

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:84%
is humanity did a lot of
effort to alter and modify

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:90%
its own environment.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
It kind of denaturalized
everything on the planet.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It affected everything
and everyone,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
but it still has
this very rare idea

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
of keeping itself human, while
still separating from nature.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:84%
We say it's even an insult
to say like, oh, you're

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
such a monkey or monkey
business or something.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's trying to--

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:84%
it's a very complex,
psychological pattern

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that we see in humanity
that they on the one hand

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
try to move themselves away
from nature, on the other hand,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:84%
try to modify everything-- food,
the environment they live in,

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't adapted
to what they changed.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
They change the
environment so fast,

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
but tried to stick to what
they are as much as they can.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a question
about definition.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:90%
What is humanity?

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to stay
the way we are?

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Do we want to change things?

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, the universe
is a modifying process.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing good or bad
about modifying and altering

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:90%
It brings diversity.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
It brings new chances,
new opportunities.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I find pretty
risky about AI implementing

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
into human biology is the
question about decisions.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is very strictly
linked to a computer program,

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:84%
you get pretty close to
the border of free will.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So someone can
actually push a button,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and someone feels
anger, someone becomes--

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
this is basically what's been
done to soldiers 70 years ago

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in World War II,
giving them drugs

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
to make them more aggressive or
something, modifying their DNA.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically something
where the number one principle

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, meaning
having free will in order

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.547 align:middle line:84%
to create diversity,
is a bit endangered.

00:26:49.547 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So a lot of people
talk about ET contact,

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:84%
but why are they using their own
bodies when they could be using

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:90%
programmed life forms or AI.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot safer,
wouldn't you think?

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, logic
would dictate--

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:90%
fumbling words here--

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.177 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There you go.

00:27:08.177 --> 00:27:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That it would
be much safer to use AIs.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:84%
The problem's that
it actually extends

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:84%
way back into the
'50s and '60s when

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:90%
we would send satellites out.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And they go, we sent a
satellite out to a probe.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:90%
It looks at things.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Gathers information, and it
might be looking at a planet

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and describe it in weight and
density and all the numbers.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But it can't describe
the color and the texture

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and the starkness of it.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
As Buzz Aldrin once
said about the moon,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:90%
magnificent desolation.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:90%
That's so human.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how he would look at it.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to get
an AI to do that.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, I
think as time goes on,

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:84%
they develop their
emotions, they'd

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:84%
be the most likely
one to send out.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your question
about ET involvement,

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:90%
their advanced way--

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.660 align:middle line:90%
they got years on us.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:90%
They're way ahead of us.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:10%
So when that
'Oumuamua thing that

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:10%
came in rolling like a
big rock it was rolling,

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:10%
it was real suspicious thoughts
were going on with astronomers

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:10%
by the way this
thing was rolling

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.420 align:middle line:10%
through our solar
system, turning corners.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things don't
turn corners out in space

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:84%
unless it's got some kind
intelligent drive on it.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So they were saying maybe
it's just an AI swinging

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
by communicating with our AIs,
downloading the information

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and then moving on.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
that's very logical.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:90%
That makes a lot of sense.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So they may have
already done it.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I would think that when we
have our first encounters,

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
they won't be
biological entities.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be AIs,
extremely advanced robots, that

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.598 align:middle line:84%
will have a full set of working
emotions as we know it--

00:29:03.598 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Representing another--

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.772 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Another race
that it's coming from.

00:29:06.772 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, what's your
experience with that?

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.585 align:middle line:84%
So having studied
so-called exotic types

00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:84%
of nonterrestrial
lifeforms, we have

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
seen that species
use AI in order

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:25.440 align:middle line:84%
to make contact, which means
they have apparatus to connect

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:84%
their own consciousness with a
so-called bodily vessel, which

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
they then use-- which
appears to be human,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and they use it in order
to make contact in order

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to make the conversation and the
approach much more comfortable.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Because humans react positive
to something they already know.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
creates comfortable patterns

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.930 align:middle line:90%
on the brain.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen is
in contact scenarios

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that ETs prefer to
appear in human form.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
What we've also seen is
that it's not a good idea

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
to completely rely yourself
and your whole species

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.230 align:middle line:84%
upon biological AI bodies,
which brings a lot of problems.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
You could think that
substituting a biological body

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:84%
with an AI body would bring
only positive side effects,

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:90%
but the thing is--

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and we learned that,
and those species

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:84%
had to learn that over
some time-- is that there's

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
something to the development
of consciousness and the soul

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and the body, which
all three of them

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.220 align:middle line:90%
need to be developed separately.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness in
the soul needs to develop.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
needs to develop

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to know that one is
more than your own body,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:56.020 align:middle line:84%
but the body itself has
its own right to live.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically the
nature of the universe.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I always like the
example that when

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:84%
you put people on
a roller coaster,

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and people know it's going
into a loop or something,

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:90%
but they scream.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They make these
kind of ape noises.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It's screaming, and it
comes from somewhere.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come from your own.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It's your body reacting to it.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Yourself, you can be calm,
and you can enjoy this,

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.800 align:middle line:90%
but your body is shaking.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's a different
kind of intelligence

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:90%
that is mingled with yourself.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you get rid of
that, you basically

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
get rid of a part of an
evolutionary strain that

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:90%
also needs to develop.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen, for example,
with the Greys, which

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
are studied, that this
technique of getting rid

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:56.370 align:middle line:84%
of a biological body
didn't work out very well.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.725 align:middle line:84%
It brought a lot of
side problems to them.

00:31:58.725 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It makes
absolute sense to me.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:84%
By doing what you're
suggesting, what

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
the price that would
come with that is

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.430 align:middle line:90%
you would lose your diversity.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Even the AIs don't want that.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.210 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
appreciate diversity.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Think about it-- they're
coming off an assembly line.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:84%
If anybody knows
about diversity,

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
it'll be them because they
know what uniformity is.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're born as.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Stamp them out like
cookie cutters.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But they found out that
through diversity, they

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:84%
get stronger because
they learn more,

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and each individual has a
variation on everything.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And from those
different variations,

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.690 align:middle line:84%
learn them and download
them as a whole,

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that makes you a pretty
smart entity to deal with.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're
saying the eye is

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.338 align:middle line:90%
aware of that, diversity.

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, they
are aware of diversity,

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:84%
probably more
painfully than we are.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It bothers them, I think, that
they come off the assembly line

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:84%
because they realize
that's not how humans--

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.870 align:middle line:84%
humans are born, and they're
each are individuals and grow

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.580 align:middle line:90%
up to be different.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Even though they've
got trillions of cells

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:84%
in somebody, those cells every
seven years, they all change.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:90%
That's something AI can't do.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
the same from time

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:84%
it's created to the time
it dies hardware-wise.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, software is
a different story,

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting to look at
that on two different levels.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:84%
They realize their
hardware bodies have

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:90%
distinct advantages over us.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:84%
They can take extreme
heat, extreme cold.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't get
hungry, not thirsty.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.990 align:middle line:90%
They can just outlive us.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.830 align:middle line:84%
The software, though, is
more complicated for them,

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and they realize that the
strength their software

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to come out of
diversity, not uniformity.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.055 align:middle line:84%
Because it's their
uniform, it's the same.

00:33:51.055 --> 00:33:53.430 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the same thing
over and over again expecting

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:54.270 align:middle line:90%
different results.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Insane.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right, and spirituality.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Spirituality is one of
the biggest components in this

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:84%
universe which cannot
be approached in a way.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the magic that all
of this is happening.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Soul-- if we're talking
about soul, having a soul,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.639 align:middle line:90%
every one of us has an idea.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:21.014 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about the
technical container that

00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:84%
contains the information
of your lifetime and stores

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:90%
them and all that.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
This is something that the
can AI replicate in a way.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, how do
you define having a soul?

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.880 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.739 align:middle line:84%
Empathy is something you can
learn through certain patterns,

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:90%
interactions.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But being able to
gain spirituality,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:84%
that is something the
Greys, for example,

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:84%
really have to deal with, which
is also one of the reasons

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:84%
why they are
interested in Earth.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the Greys,
some of them are synthetic,

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:84%
they're robotic,
and they have kind

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of like, we've talked about,
been downloaded information,

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:90%
either from an AI or something.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But do they have
consciousness, is the question?

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So having studied
them, what we've seen

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:84%
is that in their
own development,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
the Greys as a species
is a biological species.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.660 align:middle line:84%
They do have awareness,
consciousness, and a soul.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But what they did in
their development is

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that they got rid of their own
natural biological body, which

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:84%
to them made sense at that
time because they saw more

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:84%
disadvantages in
biological bodies

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.950 align:middle line:84%
because they can get
sick, they can die,

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and it made more sense for
them to artificially 3D print

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:90%
their body.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So what we have seen is
that those bodies are

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:84%
more like fibers
that are 3D printed,

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and they download
their own consciousness

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:84%
from a huge hut, a sort
of a cloud more or less,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.280 align:middle line:84%
into those little
puppets, what they use.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
They can also, through their
own economic system, they

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:84%
have a huge diversity of bodies
which they can choose from.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only that you
have those grey Greys,

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.750 align:middle line:84%
which their name derives from,
but they also have different

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:42.550 align:middle line:90%
other colors.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So they appear in purple
and in greenish color.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the planet and
the environment they work on.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
a Warrior class,

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:84%
which is much bigger
and much, much bulkier.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So what we see is that they
have kind of mixed themselves.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They have kept their own
awareness and consciousness

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and soul, but their body is
definitely a fiber printed,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.975 align:middle line:90%
artificial made body.

00:37:14.975 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fascinating.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:84%
As our final takeaway,
David and Tim,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:90%
will AI merge with humankind?

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we're always on
the way of unification, which

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:30.310 align:middle line:84%
means the more experience
we make and we have,

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:36.310 align:middle line:84%
the more information we have
on every theoretical point

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.270 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Which means we come
to the conclusion

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.955 align:middle line:84%
that AI, as much
as every other life

00:37:42.955 --> 00:37:46.190 align:middle line:84%
form on the planet and
outside of the planet,

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:84%
it's just another
viewpoint to the universe.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's all us, so it's
all one specific life

00:37:53.620 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
form that creates diversity and
different observer viewpoints.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, I don't think
that AI is so much different

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:90%
to humans to any other species.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It has the same patterns
to develop and potentially

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:19.810 align:middle line:84%
the same challenges
and problems.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, it's, as you
mentioned, it's about trust,

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's about
ethical and morality

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to create sustainability.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.990 align:middle line:90%
So that is the main question.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So once we realize that we
all are literally one being

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and as much as our blood cells
are one with us with a body,

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:84%
then AI realizes
that, then it's all

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.010 align:middle line:90%
going to be turning out well.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way--

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.182 align:middle line:90%
how we get there.

00:38:58.182 --> 00:38:59.140 align:middle line:90%
