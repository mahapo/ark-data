>>GEORGE NOORY:
Here on the surface

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:10%
we take advantage of
the sunlight and the air

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:10%
we breathe, but did you
know in the Inner Earth

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:10%
there are portions of the planet
that have never been exposed

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:10%
to sunlight, never been
exposed to the air we breathe,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:10%
to possibly even human life.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
With us today is
Emery Smith, who

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
has been on missions to explore
some of these microclimates

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:90%
within the Inner Earth.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Emery, to the program.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.015 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks,
George, for having me.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's kind of weird
to really even ascertain

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that
parts of the planet

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
have never been exposed
to sunlight or something

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
we take for granted--
the air we breathe.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, no, exactly.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look at the
Marianas Trench.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:10%
I always mention that because
there is no sunlight down

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:10%
there, yet it's full of life.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's life that flourishes
in the depths of the oceans--

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:90%
all different kinds.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It even looks alien.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting is,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
in these microclimates
in these other eco

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
atmospheres in these
pockets in the Earth

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:90%
that we talk about Inner Earth--

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
atmosphere, too,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.783 align:middle line:84%
and they have a different
kind of atmosphere.

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of atmosphere do they

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.815 align:middle line:84%
have that would be
different to ours?

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Sometimes
it's a different ratio

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:90%
of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.895 align:middle line:90%
Some are all methane.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you breathe that?

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.187 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:90%
How do you live in that?

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell
you how they do it.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We've been taking samples
and visiting these places

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:90%
for over three decades at least.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: For sure
that I'm aware of.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a special way
that life can survive even

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in the vacuum of space,
and what does that tell us?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It means you don't need the sun.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't need oxygen. You
don't need all these things

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.613 align:middle line:90%
that humans need.

00:02:12.613 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That we need.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.355 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: We take it for granted.

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For granted.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we do.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because there's
places that we can actually

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
change and adapt to if we
were there long enough.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
as being on the moon

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or being on Mars with
the gravitational forces

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:90%
and the pulling of gravity.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.695 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of these
places and Inner Earth,

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
a different type

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
of gravity in some
of these places.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.148 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, here
on the surface,

00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Emery, we have hurricanes.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:90%
We have tornadoes.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:90%
We have volcanoes.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:90%
We have sunlight.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:90%
We have snow.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:90%
We have sleet.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:90%
We have rain.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Do they have that on the
inner portion of the planet?

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have
very small storms.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:90%
They have rain.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.023 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
pollution, though,

00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:06.565 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's
really interesting.

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:08.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's because
they don't have us.

00:03:08.273 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's why things
down there grow bigger.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:90%
They flourish better.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
They have better mineral
content for the plants

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
and for the animals.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So it changes the dynamics
of the DNA over millions

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:90%
of years for these creatures.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
creatures on some

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of these areas of the
Inner Earth, I'll say,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:90%
don't need even light or water--

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To exist.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --to survive,
because they're living off

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:84%
what we call chemogenesis,
which is life from chemicals

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.246 align:middle line:90%
that the earth gives off.

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:50.046 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Naturally.

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:50.846 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Naturally.

00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, naturally.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
The same thing that the life
down there in the Marianas

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Trench near these hot vents
that would fry us-- we

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.035 align:middle line:84%
would just be boiled
to death in seconds.

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They thrive on it.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.952 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they thrive
on these chemicals

00:04:04.952 --> 00:04:06.077 align:middle line:90%
that are coming from where?

00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Where are those chemicals?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Inner Earth.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, how coincidental.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These different
climates that may be

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:90%
in the Inner Earth--

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
are they changeable
all the time,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:90%
or are they pretty constant?

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We have noticed, after
tracking some of these for over

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:90%
a decade--

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and I know this because
after reading and watching

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
videos of past missions
before I came on board--

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that there are
changes being made.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason these
changes are being made

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
is because the earth
is constantly shifting.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It's turning.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes just a
small degree or two

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
would change an entire
environment down there,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
or if there was an
earthquake, or if there

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of
an unbalanced type

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
thing going on that from Earth's
magnetic core, the field--

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
the toroidal field down
there affects things.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
snow down there?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there are areas
that are just like Antarctica.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just a giant slab of ice,
like the biggest ice skating

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:90%
rink you've ever seen.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And what's interesting
is that water that freezes

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:84%
has that capability
of bioluminescence.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's this beautiful blue
glow that emanates on the walls,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.022 align:middle line:90%
on the dome.

00:05:29.022 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's gorgeous.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's amazing, and
there's other places in there

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that are completely
contained aquifers

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:90%
with living creatures there.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are there so many
different kinds of ecosystems

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:84%
much like we have on
the planet, of course?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
We've got different
climates at any given time.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.740 align:middle line:90%
How do they do?

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.073 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there's tropical.

00:05:56.073 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:90%
There's arctic.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:90%
You have--

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rain, snow,
all at the same time.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have the same
thing in different areas,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's because of the
location of these pockets

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:90%
towards the center of the Earth.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So some places,
believe it or not,

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
are colder near the
center of the Earth.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Some are warmer.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:90%
It just depends.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was telling you.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The inner part of the
center of the Earth

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is always moving, so
you might actually

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
have a place that
will have a season--

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
they might actually have a
seasonal pocket, believe it

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's just because of
the location of these pockets.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
If they're near the crust of
the Earth underneath the ocean,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:84%
or if they're closer to
the center of the Earth,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
or if they're-- it just
depends on the location,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:90%
which determines--

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:90%
there's places with huge forest.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.130 align:middle line:84%
There's places with
just pure desert.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
There's places with ice
as far as the eye can see.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are these
pockets changing climate-wise

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:90%
constantly?

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some are, like
I was saying earlier,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
because of the earthquakes

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and the shifting of
the axis of the Earth.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So I think maybe what I
haven't seen before I left

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:90%
was new pockets forming.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And I heard through
second hand information

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
recently that pockets
are forming now with life

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:90%
after maybe one gets destroyed.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of life?

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Just new life from--

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:90%
new plant life, new--

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Similar to
Earth or different?

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, yes, yes.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Always similar to Earth.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So no dinosaurs
or anything like that?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.473 align:middle line:84%
Very large reptiles,
though, but no dinosaurs.

00:07:51.473 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you went
down to the Inner Earth

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and you saw the various
climates, were you in shock?

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh my
goodness, especially

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:84%
the first couple times with
all the different lights.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have special
helmets that change

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
color for tints and things,
because some of the places

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:90%
were--

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
because of the gas and
the bioluminescence

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that was in there, it
was extremely bright.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:90%
It was too bright.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It was like looking
at one of those blue--

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That hurt
the eyes, I bet.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.872 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it would
burn your eyes out.

00:08:23.872 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like looking at
a nuclear bomb going off.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
We had to have thermonuclear
protection for our eyes

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
with these helmets, and
no one's ever gotten hurt,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
but it's just a
very interesting--

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
it was mind boggling
to know that here we

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:84%
are X amount of miles down
deep here in the planet,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and there is this bright light
that can burn your eyes out.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is that?

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you say that
these climatary pockets

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
in the Inner Earth
are not tied together?

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:90%
And then what are they?

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're
not all connected.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
They're many, many, many,
many, many, many miles apart,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, however, when
there is these veins of magma,

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
or oil, or whatever
break into them,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that's the only time where
they can actually get connected

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.178 align:middle line:90%
and get destroyed.

00:09:27.178 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other than
that, they're separate.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Other than
that, they're separated.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
in a climate or environment

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
where somebody died
because of the climate?

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, if that's
happened a few times.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes the suits fail.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you might bump into
something that tears your suit.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
shouldn't bump into.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Or you might be
attacked by something,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and depending on the atmosphere
and what gas is there,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
whatever you were
infected with-- maybe it

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
was poison from an insect
that can bite through a suit

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't
even know could do it.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So we've had many,
many fatalities.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have extreme
weather on the surface.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Do they have extreme
weather within the planet?

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've never seen
anything extreme as far as like

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
a hurricane or--

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tornadoes.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Tornado.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I've not seen the
wind part, but I have

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:90%
seen lightning in these areas.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.068 align:middle line:90%
Lots of lightning.

00:10:41.068 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
static electricity.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, there's a
lot of static electricity,

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
which I think is conducive
to the plant life

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.708 align:middle line:84%
and to the animals
because this--

00:10:52.708 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
that, when you

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:90%
put all these ions in the air--

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's where they came up
with the fourth state of water

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is basically a plasma
state of water.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a fourth state
where it allows the water

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to have so much electricity
in it that, if you drink it,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
it super charges
your mitochondria

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and also changes the
voltage of your DNA.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very
conducive thing

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:90%
for the cells that the plants--

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
for the water, for the animals
to become so healthy and so

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
enormously large.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These extreme
environments that you have

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:90%
faced on the top and within--

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:90%
how extreme do they get?

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What happens
on top of the Earth

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
affects what's inside the
Earth, and a lot of that

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
scaler infotometry,

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.895 align:middle line:84%
us blowing up nuclear
bombs underground,

00:11:54.895 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:90%
contaminating things.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've
destroyed the inside.

00:11:57.488 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We're
destroying the inside.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be one of
the worst catastrophes here

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
in the future on
Inner Earth, anyway.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a bad tooth
rotting from the inside out,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and that could affect
the top of the Earth,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
balance of homeostasis

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
of what's in the Earth and
what's on top of the Earth.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what's
blowing up, what's not,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.920 align:middle line:90%
what tectonic plate is shifting.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Things like this have
a detrimental effect

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:84%
on these beautiful,
amazing places down there.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So they're recording everything.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:90%
They're monitoring everything.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
They're keeping a great database
on all this for the future.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So if anything were to
happen to the planet,

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
we could at least
allow this information

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to come out to
educate the people.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of good
things will come out of it.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gravity.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
You know what it does to us
on the planet on the surface?

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Does it affect anything there?

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we did
notice that these pockets--

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
gravity changes, and this is has
been measured over many times

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
of scientists going
back and forth,

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:90%
and measuring the gravity.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And we believe it
has to do, of course,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
with the core of the Earth
and the magnetic field

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:90%
that the Earth is giving off.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows that
compasses are usually

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
working because of the
giant iron ore deposit

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%
up at the North Pole there.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why they say
what's true north is--

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and what's magnetic north.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They're the two
different north things,

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's because
of these deposits.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So the deposits in the Inner
Earth are moving around,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.137 align:middle line:84%
and it's affecting the
gravity inside these pockets.

00:13:50.137 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it ever
affect the team that's

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.353 align:middle line:90%
down there on their mission?

00:13:53.353 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you go wacko
or anything like that?

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, you don't go wacko.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it
affects you that way.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not an
electromagnetic field

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:90%
that will make you go crazy.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, wow, I
just gained 20 pounds.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe I'm 20 pounds lighter.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Wow, this is neat.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.996 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
location of these--

00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:84%
one might be near more
the center of the Earth.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
One might be farther
away, and they

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.837 align:middle line:84%
have their own magnetic
field, as well,

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
keeps it an environment.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a magnetic
field in atmospheres and things

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
like that to keep
whatever life is there.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm getting at
it is it changes yearly

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.592 align:middle line:84%
on the inside because
the Earth is shifting.

00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As the Earth
shifts, it changes.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It changes.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There is
this balance, like I'm

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:90%
talking about this homeostasis.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happens on top of
the Earth or Inner Earth,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
it affects both sides,
which could be good

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and could be bad because
we don't want a bad virus

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to escape from upper
Earth down to middle Earth

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:90%
and kill off a bunch of--

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or vice versa.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Or vice versa.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
sightings, by the way,

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
like the chupacabras and all
the crazy stuff you hear about--

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
all these people
talking about things

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.383 align:middle line:84%
in the desert they see in
the middle of the night--

00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
creatures, I think,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.288 align:middle line:84%
somehow have escaped
from these areas.

00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they have come up?

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have come up due
to maybe an earthquake made

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
a crevice open, and
people are starting

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.535 align:middle line:84%
to see more beings
all around the world.

00:15:37.535 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So I think a
lot of these creatures,

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:40.975 align:middle line:90%
like sasquatches and--

00:15:40.975 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chupacabras.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Chupacabras.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes when
there's earthquakes

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:84%
certain crevices open
up, and these creatures

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.487 align:middle line:90%
do escape to the surface.

00:15:50.487 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They probably do.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:90%
How do we know--

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.113 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then they mate and
hybridize with other animals.

00:15:55.113 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With animals
that are on the surface.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know bigfoot
isn't from the Inner Earth?

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I know he's an
extraterrestrial, that they've

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:84%
been here for a very long
time, and they do live

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
in Inner Earth, but
not the Inner Earth

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking about.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But they are also not
from here, as well.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But they've been
here for a long time,

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and they've been watching
over Earth and taking samples.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they have kind
of mastered teletransportation.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's always funny no one
can get a bigfoot on camera

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:90%
because they--

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other than
Patterson-Gimlin.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You only see it for a
second, and then all of sudden

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.085 align:middle line:90%
he went behind the tree.

00:16:45.085 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's gone.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And then he's gone.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Because they have that ability.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We know there are
bodies of water and lakes

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:90%
down under.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Are there fish life
there, too, Emery?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's an abundance
of fish life down there,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and plankton, and seaweeds,
and underwater plants.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And they survive down
there without light,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:90%
but they have bioluminescence.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything's bioluminescence.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And they survive also
through chemogenesis,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.660 align:middle line:84%
through the
chemicals bubbling up

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
through these areas
of the planet.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big are the fish?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they shark
size, whale size?

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there are
always some similar narwhal

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:90%
looking fish down there.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
The largest ones I've ever
seen were maybe 35 feet long,

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:84%
but they look like
normal fish, just larger.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Salt or freshwater?

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:41.627 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Both.

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
There's fresh and salt
water pockets down there--

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That harbor these fish.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
witnessed oil down under?

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, only on the maps.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So but you haven't
seen pockets of oil?

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
to be down there.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.887 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, there are, yes.

00:17:58.887 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm a believer
that oil was not created

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:90%
by plants and dead dinosaurs--

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
that it's part of the planet.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
It's always been
part of the planet.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.062 align:middle line:84%
So there's got to be an
abundance of it everywhere.

00:18:10.062 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What makes
you think that?

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:90%
I always have.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a theory by a scientist
named Thomas Gold who believes

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:90%
in the abiotic oil theory--

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that the planet itself
has all this oil.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Carbon was always here.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The Russians believe
that, as well.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:84%
There have been
many oil lakes that

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
have filled up after they
were emptied and drained years

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, how can
you have dead dinosaurs

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
six miles down where they've
sometimes extracted oil?

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm convinced it's
part of the planet,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:84%
but I would have thought that
maybe you would have witnessed

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:90%
pockets of oil down there.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I haven't.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I haven't seen that.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it on the maps--

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:84%
on the holographic imaging
maps and, of course,

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.385 align:middle line:84%
on the deep ground
penetrating radar maps.

00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oil pockets?

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, oil pockets.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But I've never personally been
in one, or been next to one,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:84%
or seen one, but I do believe
they definitely exist.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of agree with you
with the whole carbon thing,

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's been around
not just our planet,

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.437 align:middle line:90%
but many other planets.

00:19:25.437 --> 00:19:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think when the planet
was formed four billion years

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:90%
ago it's part of the planet.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Always was.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I kind
of agree with that.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
want to say that we

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:90%
have an abundance of oil.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say we
should use it as a fuel,

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
because there is pollution on
this planet, but it's here.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
we're going to run out.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I think it's endless.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is endless.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.893 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
will ever happen.

00:19:47.893 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that, after these
overunity devices start

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:84%
coming out, that
we won't ever have

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:90%
to use gas, coal, or oil again.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
right around the corner.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we know
about the core of the planet?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
They've always talked about
some liquid core that's fiery.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And if it ever stops,
the planet dies.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about it?

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I know that
through looking at the maps

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
that it's always
expanding and contracting,

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of looks
like a splatter.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So it has these,
not tendrils, but it

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:84%
does have this kind
of movement to it,

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
because the earth is
always in movement.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And it does have a liquid
core that is made up

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:90%
of many, many things.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is why
we're having a lot of issues,

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:90%
too, on the planet.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It is because our
axis seems to be

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:90%
starting to turn a little bit.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, it is.

00:20:51.445 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it's shifting.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:84%
These poles could
possibly shift,

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.952 align:middle line:84%
and it's because of this Inner
Earth thing that's going on.

00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, your compass is
not going to read the same--

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Nope.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --10 years from
now as it does today.

00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything's
changing on this planet.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it dangerous for us
on the surface, what's

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:90%
happening in the Inner Earth?

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As long as we're
prepared and have a really

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
understanding and realization
that it is going to happen,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
prepare for this--

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
so people in Florida should buy
a good ski jacket just in case.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There goes
the oranges, right?

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's all going
to be a frozen popsicle down

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.572 align:middle line:84%
So it will have a huge
effect on the planet

00:21:40.572 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:84%
in many different ways
when this happens.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sooner than later?

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think
pretty soon, yeah.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I think within the
next 100 years.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're not
ready for this.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, maybe that's
what needs to happen.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
we have seen what

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
has happened in the midwest
during the winter in terms

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:90%
of climates.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my god, temperatures
minus 60 degrees.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Unbelievable.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we adapt
to the future, Emery,

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:90%
if it even gets worse?

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:90%
How do we cope?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The human race
is a very adaptable race,

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:90%
and look it.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:84%
We're still here
after everything.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So far.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.182 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: So far.

00:22:21.182 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't killed each
other all off completely yet,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:84%
but we do have to start
respecting the planet more

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and having more research dumped
into this so we can prepare.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have a Richter
scale that will

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
let us know a few
years in advance

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.920 align:middle line:90%
that this is going to happen.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know they're
watching this very closely,

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
but they're not sharing the
information with the public.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why
that is, but maybe they

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.763 align:middle line:84%
don't want to cause
panic or something.

00:22:54.763 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you went
down to the Inner Earth

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
on your missions, did they
bring a climatologist with them?

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There was always
some climatologist,

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:84%
or atmospheric
specialist, or there's

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
like 15 scientists
were usually you

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.210 align:middle line:84%
know going in at the same
time, and some in pairs.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
baffled by things

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:90%
they found and discovered?

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Of course.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand,
too, there's

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
different wavelengths that we
weren't used to understanding

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:84%
down there with the
climates, and the atmosphere,

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and how these animals
and plants were surviving

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:90%
on barely any light at all.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Just that by itself
is astounding.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's an
amazing, amazing thing.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
atmosphere had a lot

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
to do with keeping the
self sustainability

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:90%
of these ecosystems.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So they're studying that and
bringing that information,

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
that intelligence
to the surface,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
looking up at our skies,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and taking samples,
and saying, how

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
do we reproduce this perfect
atmosphere down here up here?

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, these
little creatures--

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
did they adapt to the
climate change down there?

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the creatures
that we brought up, of course.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
We have many, many,
many giant aquarium type

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.740 align:middle line:84%
vacuum sealed underground
facilities where they're

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:90%
trying to duplicate this.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
little aquarium to go

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
into when our
atmosphere fails, so we

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
have to do something
about climate change.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to really start working
on that and focusing on that.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we learn
from the Inner Earth

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:90%
about climate change?

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Exactly, and that's
exactly what they're doing.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:84%
They're taking what's down
there, taking the samples.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:84%
They're looking and monitoring
with amazing equipment,

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and then they're coming up
here, measuring this, comparing

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.650 align:middle line:84%
all the variables and the
algorithms, and saying,

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:07.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have to stop
using gas, coal, and oil,

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth
is going to kick us

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:90%
off one way or the other.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One way or another.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it
just has to change,

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.168 align:middle line:90%
and we can change it overnight.

00:25:18.168 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the cool
thing about this.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's too much
money involved, Emery.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, yeah,
that's the problem.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The greed and the
ego is in the way,

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:84%
but if we don't have
Earth, we don't have us,

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.620 align:middle line:90%
and that's the bottom line.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The pole is shifting.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And if it does--

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic pole-- what do
you think is going to happen?

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I
think it's going

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:90%
to be a catastrophe for sure.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a global
catastrophe because it

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.578 align:middle line:90%
has to do with also the plates.

00:25:54.578 --> 00:25:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tectonic plates.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, the
tectonic plates.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be massive
earthquakes and massive damage

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of cities.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So those of us
on the surface, look out.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to find a safe place,

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's going
to be hard to do

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:20.133 align:middle line:84%
if we don't have a train to jump
on to go to Mars or wherever.

00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do you
ever see the day that we

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:90%
will live in the Inner Earth?

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I think
there is a possibility that

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
may happen at some point in
the very, very far future,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
or it'll be turned into more
of a zoo-like atmosphere

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:84%
for studying how it should
have been or how it will be.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with we're
studying the Inner Earth.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to figure it out.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to figure it
out on top of the Earth.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't get
our crap together.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It's terrible,
because everyone's

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
focusing on a
different thing, and we

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
need to just focus on one
thing, and that's free energy.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tesla wanted
free energy, Emery,

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:90%
and look what happened to him.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:84%
They stole his
plans after he died,

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and we never found
out what happened.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I know.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.148 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's
the way it goes.

00:27:14.148 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's just the way
the big corporate monsters--

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and of course, you know I have
a lot of experience with that.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.760 align:middle line:84%
