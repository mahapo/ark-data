00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:10%
Jay Weidner here.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.174 align:middle line:10%
And we are talking
to Jason Rice.

00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Hi, Jay.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for having
me again today.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: So Jason, of all
the ET civilizations

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:10%
that you have known,
what would you

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:10%
say was the most important
spiritual aspect of them?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'd say the most
important spiritual aspect

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
of the various ET
groups that I've

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
run across was their bond and
belief in working together

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
with their environment,
with, cooperatively,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:90%
their surroundings.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were more
interested and concerned

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and focused on living in that
moment, working with that day.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did any of
these ET groups

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
that you were in contact with,
do they have a concept of God?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was a
wide range of beliefs

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
among the various groups
on all the planets.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more isolated groups
had some polytheistic beliefs.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
There were groups within some
of the civilization centers

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:90%
that had monotheism.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your
question, yeah, there

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
was wide ranging, whether
there was one or multiple gods

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that they believed and worshiped
or called upon for a favor

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:90%
or for help.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How about
animism, the belief

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that everything in nature
has an animating spirit?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: In fact, that was
the predominant belief

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:90%
on Planet One.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of the remote
areas on Planet Two,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
that was their prominent belief,
was the everything, animals,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:90%
trees, mineral, rock.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do they have any rituals
that would go with this?

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They did have rituals
for the harvest seasons,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
similar to what you would have
heard about on Earth for both

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
the beginning and
ends of the harvest

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
seasons, the preparation
for the rainy season,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
getting ready for
a happy harvest,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and now prayers
throughout the season

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that their
crops or their fishing

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:90%
was sustained or maintained.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Here on Earth,
we have rituals

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
throughout the year which mirror
our agricultural practices.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Christmas and the New
Year's and all of these

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
are actually built
around us once

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:90%
being an agricultural people.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Do they have those same types
of rituals and experiences?

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They did,
Jay, starting off

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
as an agrarian society, in which
that was the basis that allowed

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
them to progress into other
trades and other crafts

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
so that all of their
time wasn't spent

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:84%
in trying to grow food to feed
themselves and their family.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What about
fertility rituals?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Like we have Easter
in the springtime,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
fertility ritual.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had a
similar fertility ritual

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that was associated
with the bonding

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:90%
ritual between a couple.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was generally
done within a month or two

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
after the bonding
ceremony, and which

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
they would go through
and have for the hopes

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of a prosperous
and healthy family.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the application
of that towards their crops

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and growing, no, they covered
their prayers separately

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
for those--

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So they prayed?

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They did.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did they
believe they were

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.915 align:middle line:84%
in communication with a
higher source through praying?

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep, they sure did.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
They felt that
they were in touch

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
with the various gods for
the polytheistic portions,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
and whether it was
their god of the rains

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
or their god of the
sunshine to help

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
with the plantings
and the growing.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever see
effigies of these gods?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The effigies that I
did see were made of plants.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They would make them at the
beginning of the growing season

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
so that they would
progress through and end up

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
being dead by the time that
the crops were harvested.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I found
it very interesting

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that they would
not have, per se,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
like a statuette of
this particular god.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But they would create one
out of the living plants

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that they had in the
area or the very plants

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:90%
that they were planting.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So on Earth,
the farmers created

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
a system of equinoxes
and solstices,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
where the sun is in between
states or in an extreme state.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they plant according
to these signs in the sky.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Do they have the
same kind of thing?

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:84%
They tracked the
sun based on where

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:90%
it was at during the year.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
The amount of time it took
for the planetary body

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
to spin one complete revolution
on planet one was 28 hours.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:90%
For planet two, it was 32.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the amount
of hours in a day

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
were different than what
we are accustomed to.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And equally, their
measurement of where

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that sun fell in the sky for
the purposes of either more

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
sunlight or less
sunlight was tracked.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.010 align:middle line:90%
And they used a system of--

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
along the canals that they
used for their irrigation,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
they kept track of
the sun's position

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
with marks on rocks
that were placed

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
next to the canals, a primitive
but effective means of doing

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: As far as you know, did
any of these people, ET groups,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
believe in reincarnation?

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: In a sense, they did.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Planet One, their spiritual
beliefs for the soul

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
was that after the body
passed, the soul would then

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
be released and split up
amongst the various gods

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that that person had worshiped
during their lifetime.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul would
then return to those gods.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the god would then
take their portion of their soul

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:90%
to do with as the god saw.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, they
felt that that soul

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
was then returned for a chance
to come back into a life,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it was as an animal
or a plant or a person.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
On Planet Two, their
beliefs in the reincarnation

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
was that they would come
back if they needed to.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But the person's life
that they had lived

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
was determining whether
or not they were actually

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:90%
going to come back.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So like a karma thing?

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't
call it that,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
but it is more based on
an experiential lesson

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and how much they learned
and whether or not

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
they'd learned enough
during their lifetime

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
need to come back

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and that they were able
to transfer and convey

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
enough information back
to their gods or god,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
as the case may be, to be
able to skip having to return.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All right, do
any of these ET groups

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
have prophets, people who
could predict the future,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
wrote things down that happened
later, like Nostradamus?

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had had special
shamans or revered ones,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.230 align:middle line:90%
is what they called them.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They considered them
to be very wise.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether or not
those individuals

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
had tuned into the
Akashic Records

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
or were able to access
global consciousness,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.700 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
do some predictions.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And at the time
that we were there,

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:84%
those individuals had
lived in times past.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
There weren't any current ones
that were living or existing.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
writings reflected that.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But most of the writings
that they had passed on

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
had more to do with the way that
they live their life, living

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:84%
one that was honest and
integritous and helpful

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and caring and thinking
about their fellows, and just

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
a blueprint or an
instruction book for--

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did anybody,
any groups have, like--

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
well, we have the
10 Commandments,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.090 align:middle line:84%
like a bunch of rules
that you had to follow

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and that were sacred rules
people in the community

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:90%
had to follow?

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had-- each of
their gods had guidelines

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
that were followed, for
instance, not destroying more

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:84%
of the forest than you
absolutely needed to in order

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:90%
to grow crops.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They didn't call
them 10 Commandments

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
or didn't write them
on stone tablets.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But they were the rules
that each of the gods

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
had bestowed upon them from
previous wise ones that

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
had come about and said,
OK, don't go burning

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
through an entire forest
just because you didn't

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:90%
like seeing bushes and trees.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't go and hurt somebody
because they've done you wrong.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:84%
They did have
standards, so to speak,

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:84%
but they were individual
little god dependent.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So you would go to
one god and they

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.686 align:middle line:84%
would have certain sayings,
like I had mentioned.

00:10:36.686 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go to a
different god, and it

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
would cover another
aspect of a person's life.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Any of these groups
have reciprocal justice,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
where eye for an eye, where you
literally got to find some way

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:90%
to reciprocate for a wrong?

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:90%
So how would they do that?

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Their ancient past had
a lot more strife and conflict

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And for instance,
on Planet Two, they

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
had, again, another
example where

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
there was conflict and
strife in generations past

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
but had not been any
more recent, because

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of their strong belief
in the community

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and the intermixing with the
community and family, where

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:84%
it's almost become a single
organism, a single group.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And that to work out those
troubles or those issues

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
was more desirable than
an eye for an eye leaving

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:90%
you blind and toothless.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
They were more along the
lines of working things out,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
in that that's more
beneficial to the group

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
than it is to the
self-satisfaction of feeling

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:84%
like you've gotten
some of your own back.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if I accidentally
hurt somebody in the community,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean to but I hit
him with my cart accidentally

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
or a cart got loose
and ran over him,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
is there no system of-- there's
no system of I'm supposed

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to do something to
make up for the fact

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:90%
that I had this screw-up?

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, what they would
do in that instance varied

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:90%
per planet.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:84%
For one example, because of
the strong community ties,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
they would all work together and
bond together to try and help.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And accidents are accidents,
and they did happen.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:84%
There were people that did
get hurt during the times

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was there that
were legitimate accidents.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Somebody fell out of a tree
one time and broke an arm.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So they were not, on either
of those first two, the third

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
being an exception, but
on either of the first two

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:84%
planets, they were
not the kind of people

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
that were vindictive
or interested

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:90%
in long-term punishments.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They felt that that was not
a benefit to the community

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:90%
to do that, because they were--

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
if you take one person
out that's injured

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.054 align:middle line:84%
and the person out
that had the accident

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
or caused the
accident, now you've

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
got two workers
that are missing.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And so now instead of one
worker that's missing,

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that can't do the work
right now, you've got two.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So after you got involved
on these planets, especially

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle line:84%
One and Two, and you did the
things that you guys did,

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:84%
did that change them
spiritually, religiously

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:90%
at that point?

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Or do they maintain the same?

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Once the
battles were ensued,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
the culture and the
society changed.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
They went from
getting by each day

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:84%
with doing what they
had to do and needed

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to do to take care
of their families

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and to express the ways
that they wanted to express

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:90%
themselves, to survival.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you backtrack from a
higher vibration to survival

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
vibrations, what I saw happen
was overall, not in all cases

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
but in general, the
movement was more

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
towards individual survival
rather than group success.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:90%
And so yes, it's a--

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they
moved from concern

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:84%
with the group to concern with
their own individual life?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that would
be what, going down now?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.145 align:middle line:90%
Or would that be a turn up?

00:14:36.145 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: In my
opinion, that would

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:84%
be a going down, the vibration,
in the vibrational scale,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did it become noticeable?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It did.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And in fact,
returning to Calidus 3

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to help with the
rebuilding efforts--

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and I think I'd mentioned
before that suddenly they

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
had bars and seedy outfits and
some organized crime starting

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:84%
to show up and more of these
serviced self-oriented me, me,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:90%
me type of activities.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing like that
when we first got in there.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
war had changed them

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
so much from the good of
the many to the good of me

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:90%
mentality.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like
that across the board,

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
but there was definitely
a prevalence of it.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.875 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were changed.

00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:90%
They were definitely changed.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Can you describe some
of the different religions

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual practices that you
were exposed to on the planets?

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: One particular
spiritual practice

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:90%
had to do with the fishermen.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
One particular village we went
out to visit with a fisherman,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:90%
he and--

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:84%
one was his son and another
one was another young man

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:90%
from the village.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And they all had the
darkest, leatheriest skin

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
from countless years of being
in the sun on the water.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And their skin
looked like leather.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was clearly sun-damaged.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The clothes that they
had were threadbare.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of fish that
they were fishing for,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
one was like a large catfish
that they would bottom fish.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
others, a pike,

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and another was like a
really large bream, something

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
on the order of 24
to 30 inches long.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a big one.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But that's what the
fish looked like.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Before they would
embark for the day,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
they would take
some of their bait.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And they would clean the knife
or rub the knife in the bait

00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to get some of the fluids from
the animal or the dead insects

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was
that they were using.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.923 align:middle line:84%
And then they would hold up
the knife and say a prayer.

00:17:05.923 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
take the knife

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and then clean off
the knife on the dock.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it was two lines.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was a line
and an across line.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And I never did figure
out the patterns

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
for what the lines meant, but
it meant something to them.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was their
individual prayer for,

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
let me go out and
catch a bunch of fish.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did any of the
beliefs that you came across

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.410 align:middle line:90%
have a personal effect on you?

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'd say that probably
the biggest personal effect

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:84%
on me was the
generalized community

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:90%
effort that they shared.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter what
part of the city in area 26

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that you went to, they were
all super helpful, friendly,

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:90%
giving.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
The concept of deceit wasn't
even in their vocabulary.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So our acceptance
into the city, even

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
though we were
pretending to be a trade

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
delegation from a faraway
city, they didn't doubt it.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:84%
They didn't ask any
probing questions.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look
at us crossways.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:90%
We were just accepted.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the spirituality of
helping and being compassionate

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and giving without
expectation of return,

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that was something that struck
me incredibly powerfully,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:84%
because it was clearly something
that I wasn't used to seeing.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're saying they
didn't lie to each other?

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I imagine that there
were cases where they did,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
but their beliefs
and their practices

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.120 align:middle line:90%
were that they didn't need to.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was alien
to me and to us,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:84%
because humanity from Earth is
so entrenched, unfortunately,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:90%
in politics and deceit and lies.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And that just wasn't their way.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't their methodologies
for dealing with each other.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was profound.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did you guys lie to them?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course we did.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:84%
We told them we were a
delegation from another city,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:84%
After the kinetic energy
weapon strike came in

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and the majority of
that city's population

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
were either dead or
missing, we transitioned

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:90%
into a more straightforward.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
We were able to bring
out our equipment

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and talk to them about
what we were doing there

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and how we wanted
to help, and helping

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
them to gather the dead that
we could find and help them

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
with their burial process,
as well as helping

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
them to clean up the city
and get rid of debris

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and straighten out things
and move things around.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How about the
other way around?

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys try to convert
them to your religions?

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Was that forbidden?

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:13.822 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:20:13.822 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely not
allowed from the standpoint

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
of we were not supposed
to directly affect

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.130 align:middle line:84%
their social or
cultural belief systems.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to leave
them in place as they were.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And if they changed
organically, then that

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:90%
was something different.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But we weren't
supposed to change it.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.367 align:middle line:90%
Now, the fact that--

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I was going to say, you--

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were alcohol
starting to show up

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and bars and other
seedy locations.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Clearly people had
been talking or had

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:90%
been offering suggestions.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you feel
bad about all this?

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I did.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Being moved as I was by the type
of civilization that they had

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and how gracefully
caring that they were,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't something that
I wanted to see destroyed.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.684 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something that
I wanted to see changed.

00:21:11.684 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But in
fairness to you, you

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.141 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that this was
really going on anyway.

00:21:15.141 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You'd been told to honor
the prime directive and all

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.967 align:middle line:84%
But really, it was later,
right, that you found out that--

00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was much later.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Were there spiritual guilds?

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were--
they didn't call them

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.625 align:middle line:84%
guilds for the spiritual
or religious gods.

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Their wise ones were
the keepers of that.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So the individuals that chose
to go and study and practice

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and work in the philosophy
or the spirituality aspects

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:84%
of their different gods,
those were the ones.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.417 align:middle line:84%
They were as close to a preacher
or a reverend as they had.

00:22:05.417 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: But they weren't chosen--

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --or anything?

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:84%
How did they rise
above the ranks

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:90%
and become a spiritual leader?

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The individual that
had the passion and interest

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that studied and
their own form of meditation

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and prayer, that immersed
and flooded themselves

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:90%
into those topics.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.675 align:middle line:84%
The other subject that
comes up is one of churches.

00:22:35.675 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, did they have
spiritual houses?

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Did they have spiritual
buildings or places

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
where the deities
were worshipped at?

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.700 align:middle line:84%
They did have certain
facilities or buildings

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that these wise ones, that's
where their lodging was.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where their homes or
compounds were set up at.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And depending on which god
it was that they were there

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
to represent, sometimes
you'd have a wise one

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that had two or three or
four different deities

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:84%
that he or she was knowledgeable
about on his property.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it may have
been just a little alcove.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And another time, it may
have been an entire building.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.037 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there were both men
and women spiritual leaders.

00:23:25.037 --> 00:23:25.995 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:23:25.995 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Well, that's good.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Their rituals that they would
use and do, were they symbolic?

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.057 align:middle line:90%
Were they physical?

00:23:33.057 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:90%
What were they like?

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The rituals varied
depending on the god.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
They did have symbols
to represent the gods.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
There are a few of them
that I can remember.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
One of them was a
crescent with a line

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.110 align:middle line:90%
straight through the crescent.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And that was for their sea god.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Another one was like a triangle
with the apex pointed down.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was for their
planting, for the agricultural

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:90%
or dirt or the soil.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
They did have rituals
in which they would

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:90%
burn their equivalent of sage.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Or they would light a
taper, very similar to some

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Native American
rituals in which they'd

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
create the smoke and
infuse everything

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.537 align:middle line:90%
in the area with the smoke.

00:24:34.537 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How about chanting?

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear any chanting?

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And saying
prayers at the same time.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.606 align:middle line:84%
I was just about
to say that, yeah.

00:24:39.606 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what
about meditation?

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.021 align:middle line:90%
Did they have meditation?

00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Do they do meditation
on these planets?

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Some of the people
practiced the meditations.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Those that were--
generally, the meditations

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:90%
were practiced by the wise ones.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:84%
There was some use of it amongst
the rest of the population,

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't an everyday ordeal
for the average Joe Citizen.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How about weapons?

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Did they have weapons?

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Planet One and Two--

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Planet One had weapons that
were produced in one area.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
They had knives, because they
used them for utility purposes.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have anything in
the way of swords or pikes

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.102 align:middle line:90%
or spears.

00:25:30.102 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they
never murdered any.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
There was never
any murders, right?

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Never any murder.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Planet Two didn't have
any weapons, per se, either.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Planet Three was a
different story altogether.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The spirituality
of Planet Three,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:84%
because you had the three races,
the humanoids, the cyclopian,

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and the insectoids, the
insectoids' spirituality

00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:01.260 align:middle line:84%
was vastly different than either
the humanoids or the cyclopian.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Their spirituality was
centered around a hive god

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:90%
that they worshipped.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was monotheistic.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was a god that ruled over
all aspects of their society.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And so anything and
everything that they did

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
was attributed to
either the pleasure

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.090 align:middle line:90%
or the ire of this god.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they
had representations

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
of this god that
resembled themselves,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:90%
vastly different than humanoid.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.200 align:middle line:84%
The cyclopian gods
that they worshipped

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.950 align:middle line:84%
were a pantheon, again,
of the different earth,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:84%
wind, fire aspects in which
they would, again, have--

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
depending on their
needs for, whether it

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
was fishing or hunting
or gardening or success

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:84%
or aplenty, that determined
which of the gods

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:90%
that they prayed to.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What about superstitions?

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Did any of them
have superstitions?

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, yes they did.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Like what?

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Salt was something
that was an extreme rarity.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:90%
And they did have it.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:84%
But not having any salt oceans
meant that it had to be mined,

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:90%
and it was an extreme rarity.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And so once a year, they would
work out all kinds of deals

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
to get a pinch of salt so
that they could sprinkle it

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
over their doorstep as a
blessing for their home.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, is that a
spirituality aspect

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.930 align:middle line:90%
or is that a superstition?

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It's hard to say.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It is very hard to say.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Another one of the superstitions
was that some areas--

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and it was peculiar,
because some

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:84%
of the areas out in
the villages and even

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:84%
some of the homes in
the cities believed

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that you had to turn your
shoes over with the soles

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:84%
facing up each
night, or you would

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
run the risk of having
evil enter your shoes.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So you had to turn them
over and lay them down.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.917 align:middle line:90%
And so that was another one.

00:28:31.917 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That sounds more
like a superstition.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever meet
any of the religious leaders

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.230 align:middle line:90%
or talk to them?

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I did.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You did.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:90%
What were they like?

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The wise ones were about
like talking to a philosophy

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.860 align:middle line:90%
professor.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.320 align:middle line:84%
They were down to earth and-- or
down to their planet, very easy

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
to talk to, took a long
view on things, and yeah,

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:84%
friendly, easy to
communicate with.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really interested in you?

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Before we came
out publicly with,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're not really from around
Kansas, we were just visitors.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And so they were interested
in life in the faraway cities.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So tried to avoid those
kinds of questions,

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
because if you get
too far into it,

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:84%
you could paint
yourself in a corner.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't want
to blow our cover.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But after coming
out, they were keenly

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle line:84%
interested in the religious
beliefs that we had.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we
had a moratorium

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:90%
on any discussion of that.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, there were people that
did end up talking about it,

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:84%
because they were able
to find out information

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.314 align:middle line:90%
on our various religions.

00:29:49.314 --> 00:29:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It must have come
as quite a shock when

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
you told them that you weren't
telling them the truth.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good point,
because again, it's

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.396 align:middle line:84%
something that was
so foreign to them.

00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
They were like, well,
why didn't you tell us?

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.478 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right, why didn't you?

00:30:03.478 --> 00:30:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Why didn't you?

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the mentality of
the IDARF command staff

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:84%
is that, no, we're
going to do it our way.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:90%
And our way is being deceitful.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Would you say that
belief in a source creator

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:90%
is a universal belief?

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of varying degrees, yes.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.950 align:middle line:10%
I would say that a belief
in a source creator,

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:10%
whether it is a prosperity
god or an all-seeing one

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:10%
universal creator god,
yeah, I'd say that it is.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: In the mythologies
of these ET races,

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.390 align:middle line:84%
did you ever come across any
mention of Earth or the Earth

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.554 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:30:47.554 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, not of Earth people.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But some of the mythologies
on Planet One, Two, and Three

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:90%
had references to star people.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.236 align:middle line:84%
And that was about the closest
that it came to any references.

00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did these star
people have direct intervention

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.260 align:middle line:90%
into these communities?

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The references
that were made

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:84%
were just visitors
on all three planets.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Which I found
extremely curious, because it

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:90%
was a noninterference.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a visitation.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was not a
take over, control,

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and enslave the people,
which at first glance

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
tells me that, OK, these
were probably a benevolent ET

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.366 align:middle line:84%
race that came to visit at some
point in time in their past.

00:31:36.366 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there
anything that you

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:84%
learned from the spirituality
of these ET groups

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that benefited you in
any way in your life?

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Absolutely.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The instance that
comes right to mind

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
was when I had been taken
as a POW on Planet Three

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:90%
by the insectoid race.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The insectoids were psychic
and communicated mentally.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
They had small mouths with
a lot of really sharp teeth,

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:84%
but that wasn't used
for communications.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And during the
interrogation process,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I was able to overpower
the interrogator.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of
overpowering him and getting

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
him out of the way, there
were two other insectoids

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that were in the room, the
cave with me at the same time.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had just come out
from being unconscious.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I wasn't fully tracking
everything that was going on.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:84%
My first thought was
that those two were also

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.085 align:middle line:90%
part of the tormentors.

00:32:45.085 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I immediately went
into offensive psychic attack

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as physically
going for them.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was only after 10 or
15 seconds of my offensive

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that I realized it was a
woman and her daughter.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And the thoughts that I kept
getting from them were prayers.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it was profoundly
moving on me, in that,

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, observe,
contemplate, and act.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:27.426 align:middle line:84%
And nowhere in there is
reaction without thought.

00:33:27.426 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, that was
a very powerful moment.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What's the most
important spiritual thing

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that you got from this
experience, you personally?

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'd say the biggest
thing personally that I have

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:84%
as a takeaway, most
definitely hands down,

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.180 align:middle line:90%
is informed consent.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:55.290 align:middle line:84%
To be able to make a
informed, free will decision,

00:33:55.290 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have the informed
transparent information.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Without that, there
are a lot of pitfalls

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.120 align:middle line:84%
that you can fall
into, including

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.255 align:middle line:84%
being accessory to help
enslave other planets.

00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Thanks, Jason.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.979 align:middle line:84%
Appreciate you
being on the show.

00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:14.520 align:middle line:84%
