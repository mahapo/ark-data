00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.170 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
intelligence.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing the
phenomenon over New Jersey.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, all this talk
we've been hearing about

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
on the media and I, of
course, am from New Jersey--

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of people reporting
in from there about these drones

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:90%
and these plasma balls.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Now we both have different intel
on that, which we'll go over.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to get
your opinion on this.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So what's going
on in New Jersey?

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we have
a phenomenon involving

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of aerial
devices and crafts

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in the skies over New
Jersey and other places,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:90%
not just New Jersey.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about really
all over the world.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But, primarily, news
reports are centering

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
around New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania and southern New

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:90%
York.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have a phenomenon
of drones possibly,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:84%
unidentified balls of light,
or maybe plasma, and orbs.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: First, the
drones came, remember?

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And then the
orbs were flying around.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden, you
have these plasma balls that are

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
usually only found in lightning
storms or high electrical

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
storms, where these
lightning plasma balls--

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:84%
you can look it
up; it's online--

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that float down from the
sky or from your ceiling

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:90%
and into the ground.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of energy
is what I'm getting at.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, let's
talk about drones.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The first
phenomena that was filmed

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.805 align:middle line:84%
were suspected unknown
drones around New Jersey,

00:02:03.805 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
the central portion
of New Jersey,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
and in the southern part
around Bridgeton, New Jersey.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Those were the very
first videos that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:90%
were put out on the internet.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%
What were they?

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:90%
They were drones.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
smaller drones, easily

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:90%
identified as personal drones.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Like, I have a drone.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
You have a drone
that can be flown.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
The second part of that are the
bigger drones that are filmed--

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the guy from Bridgeton,
New Jersey, films--

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
His video explicitly
showed these large drones,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.175 align:middle line:84%
and these drones did not have
the FAA lighting system on them.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:43.975 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They had
lights all around,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
which is not characteristic
of an aircraft that's

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:90%
registered with the FAA.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK, what was that?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Asking the state police,
the New Jersey State Police,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
who were at the scene when this
guy was filming, what is that?

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Is that one of yours?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Is that the state police, or is
that a government agency one?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.415 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:03:08.415 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Asking the Pentagon, they
don't know what that is.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's number one
unexplained right there,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
a large drone with
lights all around it,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%
that can't be explained.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:90%
And then we go to the orbs.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting because
sometimes these orbs

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:90%
are seen close to drones.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And other times,
these orbs are seen

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
close to plasma balls or these
other balls of light up there.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, as you say, there's
a certain phenomenon,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
a meteorological
phenomenon, that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
can cause these orbs or
lightning balls coming out

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
of a cloud during
a lightning storm.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:90%
That's given.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, we know that.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, during these
videos that were taken,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.805 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't any
storm in New Jersey.

00:03:56.805 --> 00:03:57.605 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nothing.

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The skies
were clear, so we

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
can't say they were lightning
balls from a thunderstorm

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.065 align:middle line:84%
because there weren't
any thunderstorms.

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:07.865 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So now we've got
these three different things

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
we have to characterize
what they could possibly be

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and where they could
possibly come from.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The drone, the big drones,
the unidentified drones,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:90%
who has those drones?

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Are they extraterrestrials?

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Are they ours, some kind
of secret program, maybe

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
a SAP program that we're flying
them for some particular reason?

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Or are they a foreign adversary
coming from the Chinese

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:90%
or the Russians?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
seen over the ocean,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
over the Atlantic
Ocean, or coming close

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:90%
to the surface of the ocean.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Are they coming out of the
ocean from a submarine,

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
something submersible?

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We can map every ship
along the Eastern seaboard.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%
We know every single ship.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The Coast Guard keeps an
eye on the dangerous ones,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
the Iranian tankers that
come up and down the coast.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The Coast Guard protects
our 12-mile limit,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.538 align:middle line:90%
but they also are farther out.

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:11.663 align:middle line:84%
And that's the United States
Navy's responsibility.

00:05:11.663 --> 00:05:12.463 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So we know
what's out there.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If drones are being
launched from ships,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
don't you think the United
States government would know

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:90%
that and do something about it?

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But the Pentagon
spokesman says, we

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
don't know what these
other drones are.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
they are, Rick?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I think some
of the drones are not drones.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're some form of
an extraterrestrial craft that

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:84%
can fly in and out,
maybe of a dimension,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
because one minute
they're there,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:90%
and the next minute they're not.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
This one news camera
person on the scene--

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember exactly where
they were in New Jersey--

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
but they were filming
this huge drone.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%
They're calling it a drone.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They're saying it's a drone, and
it doesn't have any FAA lighting

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But it has lights all around
it, and it's swirling.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
It looked more like a flying
saucer to me than a drone,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.725 align:middle line:84%
but they're referring
to it as a drone.

00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:17.525 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So the public is saying
this is some kind of a drone.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But what the news
people are confusing

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:90%
is that wasn't a drone.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
That was something other than
a drone, which possibly could

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:90%
be an extraterrestrial craft.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Now where did it come from?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But another video
shows this plasma ball

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
with this object
flying out of it,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and that object that flew out
of it flew around with no lights

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Now I would say
that's definitely

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial craft,
interdimensional craft,

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
coming from maybe
a parallel universe

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:84%
or something to that
effect because it

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:90%
didn't have any lights on it.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: As I know and I've
read in the US intelligence

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
manuals and even some
classified reports,

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:84%
as one of the distinct
characteristics

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial
craft is that they

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:90%
don't have FAA lighting system.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of the
extraterrestrial crafts that we

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:84%
know and we can identify--
the United States government,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying--

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:84%
can identify flying in
our airspace at times

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.145 align:middle line:84%
have no lights at all because
they don't need lights.

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They don't
need a lighting system.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to
illuminate themselves,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
need to illuminate

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:90%
the area in front of them.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%
They can do this without lights.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you see something
that don't have any lights,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
that's when you have
to be worried about it.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
If you see something
with lights, maybe--

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.010 align:middle line:84%
now these large ones that we're
talking about with these lights

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
all around it,
that could possibly

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
be an extraterrestrial craft
that is trying to fool us

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
into thinking it's a terrestrial
craft, when in actuality it's

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.682 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial.

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I've seen
that before, yeah.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And, yeah,
I've seen that before.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I've seen reports
of it, classified

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:90%
documents, many of them.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there's some
fixed-wing planes

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:90%
that don't look conventional.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
You see these planes coming
in, and you identify them

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
as, OK, there's an
airport over here.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
That's a commercial
plane, or that's

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:84%
a fixed-wing plane coming in for
a landing, but it doesn't land.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
These smaller fixed-wing planes
do other aerial maneuvers.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Now why are they doing that?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Are they government keeping the
track of the drones or the orbs?

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But the drones, I'm sure, are
being tracked by the United

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:90%
States government.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, absolutely.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Either by
the satellite system

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
that we have to protect
the United States

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
or by the United States
government launching

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
their own drones to try to
identify the unknown drones that

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:90%
are flying in the air.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's the confusion.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because when you see
all these people taking videos

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
of what's occurring over
New Jersey and other places

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
on the East Coast, you see
all these different aircrafts

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.948 align:middle line:90%
in the air.

00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And like I said
earlier, some of them

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:84%
can easily be identified
as personal drones

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
people are flying trying
to get their pictures, too.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And you take all that away,
the bigger drones following

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
the other bigger drones are
probably the United States

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
government, trying to identify
what those other drones are.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I think that's
one of the problems we have

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
right now is the government
doesn't know what

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:90%
some of these other drones are.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
ironic part of it.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:84%
We get the reports
from New Jersey

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
because of the American press.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the world press,

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:90%
and then I keep track of that--

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I do that, too, yeah.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Japan has
experienced the same thing.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:10%
Northern India has
experienced the same thing.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Germany, Norway, Denmark,
South Africa, South Africa

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
had a rash of these drones.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
They called them drone
sightings, which are not

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:90%
characteristics of real drones.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't identify
what they are,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and Japan suffered
through the same thing.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Now there's this other
phenomena that occurred,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
a cargo ship that is
sailing south of Sri Lanka.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And they photographed
this object

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the water that
appeared to be a drone to them.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.325 align:middle line:84%
And they identified it as a
Panamanian-flagged cargo ship.

00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It came out of the water.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They said it was a drone,
had some lights on it.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It flew up straight
up in the air.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It circled the ship a few
times, and it went back

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
in the water in
front of that ship.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, what could that be?

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's entirely
different than what

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in New
Jersey, although there

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
are some reports of these
drones coming out of the ocean

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.243 align:middle line:90%
offshore off the Atlantic.

00:11:10.243 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, now
there's reports

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
in New Jersey about these drones
releasing some sort of mist,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:90%
spray, you know, gas, fog.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:84%
What could you
tell us about this?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:90%
What is it releasing?

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, let's
go back a little bit.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: When this first occurred
in December, the United States

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
government, specifically the
National Nuclear Security

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Administration, deployed a
NEST team, a Nuclear Emergency

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Support Team, to
Joint Base Fort Dix.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Dix, yeah.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And McGuire.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:10%
And along with that, they sent
a unit out of the 21st Ordnance

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:10%
Company out of Albuquerque.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:10%
And that company is
a Render Safe Team.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
They render safe improvised
nuclear devices or WMDs.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, along with that, they
sent some helicopters,

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:90%
specialized helicopters.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Now we haven't talked
about this yet,

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
but some of the things
that were flying in the air

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:84%
were, in fact, helicopters
and military drones.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: We know that.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's a technique
used by the military or the DOE

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to try to detect
ionized radiation.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a mist
that they can release,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and that mist falls or is
attracted to radiation,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:90%
ionized radiation.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, that's the way
that they could search and find

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
maybe a possible radiological
dispersal device,

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:84%
an improvised nuclear device,
or some radiation that isn't

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be in the area.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So some of that mist can
be explained by the fact

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:90%
that the DOE has a--

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Energy, which
contains the National Nuclear

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Security Administration,
they have these teams there.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So this mist comes out.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
It concentrates on something
on the nuclear isotopes

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.283 align:middle line:84%
of the radiation,
radioactive isotopes.

00:13:09.283 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
another device,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
like a satellite, that
picks up and says, wow,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
there's definitely
something in this area.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, now we're
getting into a lot

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:90%
of possible classified stuff.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways that we can
detect where a nuclear weapon is

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:90%
or an improvised nuclear device.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about an
improvised nuclear device,

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
something that is created

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:90%
by a terrorist group or some--

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Some makeshift, right.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Country, and it's
making a nuclear bomb,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
not in a conventional way of
going through a manufacturing

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
of Los Alamos or Sandia.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
They make it themselves
using fissionable material.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And those are the most deadly
ones because, number one,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:90%
they're not--

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Safe.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They might
not-- they're not safe.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And they might not get a
full yield and so forth.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But we have ways
of detecting that.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
stuff is classified,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.535 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not going
to go into that.

00:14:03.535 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The little I know about
it because there's a lot I

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:90%
don't know about it but--

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.797 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well,
this is concerning.

00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking about
getting our best units

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:90%
to find something radioactive.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a red
flag, wouldn't you say?

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, and then what
complicates it all is we send

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
these teams there, and then
there's reports that they sent

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
the 101st Airborne there, a
unit of the 101st Airborne.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:90%
There's infantry soldiers.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:90%
They have specific missions.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Why would they send
them to New Jersey?

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:90%
What's there in New Jersey?

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.785 align:middle line:84%
Is there a hostile
enemy force there?

00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Why-- but--

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's a
lot of them, right?

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't it like 800 of them?

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, I think
there's 800 of them.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.033 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a lot of people.

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, that's
like a battalion of them,

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:90%
a couple companies of them.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Why are they there?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And nobody-- and the
Pentagon spokesman

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:90%
won't even address that.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:90%
They go on to the next question.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
They ignore the
reporter's question

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
about the deployment
of these support units

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
or these support elements of the
United States military, the Air

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And the 21st Ordnance is a joint
explosive ordnance disposal

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:90%
unit.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So they have Navy, Marine, Army,
and Air Force explosive ordnance

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:90%
disposal specialists.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They're really unique.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.005 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And these
guys are elite teams,

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
a team of people that can go
in and defuse a nuclear weapon.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:90%
And why were they doing this?

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what really
complicates the understanding

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
of these drones,
different sized ones,

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
these plasma balls or plasmoids,
whatever you want to call them,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:90%
and these orbs.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Now you put this all together.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:90%
What does it come out to?

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
It comes out to some
kind of confusion

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a military operation
going on in there, maybe

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
against UAPs or
extraterrestrials

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.410 align:middle line:84%
or a foreign government,
although the State

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Department says there's no
foreign government involved

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:90%
in this.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But the Pentagon spokesman
won't really address that.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:90%
But they do say they don't--

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.302 align:middle line:84%
they can't identify
some of these drones.

00:16:16.302 --> 00:16:17.102 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about these plasma

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
balls and, of course, the
orbs and those relations

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and the differences
because they are seen right

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
after these drones
were deployed.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: OK, well,
let's, first of all,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:90%
address the plasma balls.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: We can see them.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They've been photographed
literally hundreds of times

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:90%
at different locations.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:90%
They are not stationary.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:90%
These plasma balls move.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:84%
There's really some good
videotapes of these plasma balls

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:84%
moving, and not only in a
certain small area of the sky

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
but all across the sky.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of them start
at the horizon

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and then go up to a certain
perigee and then come back down

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.635 align:middle line:90%
and then come back.

00:17:05.635 --> 00:17:10.024 align:middle line:84%
Now if it was something
that was launched by us,

00:17:10.024 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
it would be directional,
without any kind

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:90%
of control or navigation.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
These things seem to
have that navigation

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:90%
ability of moving around.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are here in one
particular part of the sky,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:90%
and then they move.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Or I've even seen some of them
jump to another part of the sky.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.427 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do you explain that?

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you saying
they're intelligent?

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're moving
in an intelligent manner.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not a scientist.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a person with
some common sense,

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and I know something
about flight operation

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and aerodynamics.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:90%
These things don't have wings.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:90%
They're moving.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So do they have a
propulsion system?

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't appear to
have a propulsion system.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
They look like a ball
of plasma or energy.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Now how can a ball of
energy or a ball of plasma

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:90%
move like it's moving?

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Is it being
intelligently controlled

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.128 align:middle line:90%
by something on the ground?

00:18:11.128 --> 00:18:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are the
orbs controlling it?

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Are the
orbs controlling it?

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the drones
are controlling it.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of these huge drones
are creating these plasma balls

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:90%
and are controlling them.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But then, again,
there are some videos

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that show just the plasma
balls and nothing else.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no other aircrafts in
the air but these plasma balls.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I wish-- and I'm sure
our government because we

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of top scientists
out there with DARPA contracts--

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
my former employee,
Dr. Hal Puthoff,

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
probably is working on
trying to figure out

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
what some of these things
are, unless we already

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
know what they are, but they're
not telling the American people.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So these plasma
balls, how are they

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.952 align:middle line:90%
different than the orbs?

00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Because they both are bright.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.537 align:middle line:90%
They both fly around.

00:19:04.537 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:84%
What's the differences
that you can explain?

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the
plasma ball is larger.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Some of them are
100 to 300 feet in diameter.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And so those are something
more than an orb.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:84%
An orb is a smaller
object, light object,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that can fly around and maneuver
in a number of different ways,

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
defying gravity at times, moving
and stopping and coming at you

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and then turn around
and going away from you.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So these are orbs that
could be a number of things.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
It could be, number one, some
kind of a reconnaissance object

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
used by maybe us or
maybe extraterrestrials.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times, you see--

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
if you go back and look at
UFO sightings but way, way,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
way back and some
of the good videos,

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
the professional videos that
are taken about years ago,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking from the '50s
on-- you see these orbs first.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, shortly later, you see
the UFO, their flying saucer.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So I would-- and I think most
people within the intelligence

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
community and in the aeronautics
community that studies these

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
things, especially
the Air Force--

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They deduce that
these orbs are probably

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:90%
a reconnaissance device.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
They come and check things
out before the bigger craft

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Even back in the '70s, we've
seen these orbs flying around.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Now jump to our current
time, and we see these orbs.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we see these
other things appearing.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the orbs are there
before the plasma balls.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the plasma balls are
there, and then the orbs appear.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.615 align:middle line:84%
So it's very confusing to
try to understand all this.

00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The orbs, through my
experience with ETs,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
is either an ET craft, an ET
itself in a different light

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:90%
body, or a civilization.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense to me why they
would send out these little orbs

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:90%
to go check everything out.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:90%
That's just normal.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, it's a
form of a reconnaissance.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
We do this on a battlefield.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.252 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We do it all the time.

00:21:17.252 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We use these small
planes or these drones

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that we shoot out, and
they survey a battlefield

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and detect the enemy
or any defenses

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:90%
the enemy put up against you.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And then now the
infantry unit can

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
move to an area that's
already been surveilled,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:90%
so we use something like this.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So why not the extraterrestrials
doing the same thing?

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Now is this based on something
else that's going to happen,

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:90%
a planned event?

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:84%
There are some people out there
within the scientific community

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and with other communities,
the advanced working group,

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
thinks that there's going
to be an event that happens

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:90%
in the very near future.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Now whether it's in 2025 or
2026 or 2027, whatever year,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
there's something
supposed to happen.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, for the audience,
what do you mean by "event"?

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, that's
a good question.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And I call it an event because
people within the intelligence

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:90%
communities calls it an event.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
They don't identify what
the event is going to be.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you really
press the people,

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:84%
they say anything else is
going to be classified,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:90%
so we can't talk about it.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:10%
But there's people out
there, such as John Ramirez,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.422 align:middle line:10%
retired CIA, and others--

00:22:41.422 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to
name all of them--

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.255 align:middle line:10%
but there's many
others out there

00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:10%
that talk about this
event that could possibly

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:10%
be an extraterrestrial event.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials might
be identifying themselves

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:90%
in this near future.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And maybe all these
things that we're

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
seeing, the orbs, the
drones, unidentified drones,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and these plasma balls
are an announcement

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.085 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrials,
hey, getting our attention.

00:23:10.085 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I like that.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And they certainly
have our attention

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that something's
going to happen.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going to let you
know what's going to happen.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we are seeing
these things, and the plasma

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:84%
balls, the orbs, and
these unidentified drones,

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:90%
to prepare the American public.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.375 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're just not getting
what the announcement is.

00:23:32.375 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, the message.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, we're missing
the message, so to speak,

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and we're spending too much
time on, rather than trying

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to understand, then
looking at the phenomena

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
without looking deep into
the understanding of it.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
that this could be

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:90%
a false flag for other agendas?

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: What I know about
the intelligence community

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and having been involved
in false flag events

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and operations,
this could very well

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
be some form of a
false flag event

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for something
else in the future.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know
what's going to happen.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what's
going to happen.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Nobody really knows what's
going to happen outside--

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:90%
in the public arena.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:90%
The government, I believe--

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe that the
United States intelligence

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:84%
service knows what's going
to happen in the near future,

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.242 align:middle line:84%
whether it's going to be
in a year or two years

00:24:34.242 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
or whenever it's going to be.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
How they know, I wish
I knew, but they know.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there was some
event or some warning

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that was given to us.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: By maybe
a contact we have

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:84%
with an extraterrestrial
race, where

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
they told us, hey, look out
for this particular time period

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:90%
because we're coming back.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Or some other species are going
to be coming back and doing

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:84%
something on Earth, announcing
themselves or some other event.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So maybe, if you
look back at what's

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:84%
been occurring, not just
here, not just in New Jersey,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:90%
but all over the world--

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.835 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All over.

00:25:15.835 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It could be a warning
of an arrival or an event,

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.560 align:middle line:84%
where the extraterrestrials are
going to come, arrive on Earth,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and make their
presence known, OK?

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably in a
neighborhood of a 60% chance

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:90%
of that's happening.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:90%
But I think my own feeling--

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:90%
this is Rick Doty's feeling--

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going
to have an arrival.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
extraterrestrials coming

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to this planet, and not
in a hostile manner,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
but just to make
their presence known.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It might be a glorious
time for this planet

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:84%
because now we can interface
with an extraterrestrial race

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:90%
in open public.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:84%
We've been doing
it for 70 years.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But now everybody
knows what to expect,

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's not going
to be a hostile event.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be a
glorious event because we

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:84%
know then when this happens,
that we're not alone

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Rick, I think
this is great information,

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:90%
great intel.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
People have been waiting
to hear this stuff,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
so I'm glad you came on
the show to talk about it.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So thanks for being here.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.858 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, it's a
pleasure being here,

00:26:26.858 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and I hope we have
a happy ending.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I do, too.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:90%
I do believe so.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm Emery Smith, and this
is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
