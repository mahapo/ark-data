>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.002 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode,
we'll bring you

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:84%
another round with
our special guest,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:84%
David Adair, a man
who actually was

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:90%
able to walk around in Area 51.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:90%
David, thanks for being back.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.136 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ADAIR: So
glad to be here.

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You're
describing this thing that

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
looks like you've just rolled
into the scene of a horror

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:90%
movie.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.855 align:middle line:84%
You've got some alien
creature, if you will,

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
with bones around it,
and it's gigantic.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.684 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have any fear as
this is all happening to you.

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:51.475 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, you're
the first person that

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:90%
ever asked me that question.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:90%
No, I was having fun.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:84%
This-- the only thing I was
scared of is Rudolph, you know?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:84%
That human down here
is dangerous, you know?

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:90%
No, this thing was just--

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:90%
I was just mesmerized.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, because every
time I see something,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I've got about 50
questions behind that.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.097 align:middle line:84%
And when the thing
started interacting,

00:01:18.097 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, shadows and
stuff like, I thought,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
man, what is going
on with this thing?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So I turned around and asked
Rudolph, can I climb up on top?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the bone worked
like lattice work.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like a rib cage
casting down on each end

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:90%
and then meeting in the center.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
The ribbing would
kind of interlace,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
so it's protecting the
big structure underneath.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you could
climb it like a ladder?

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.501 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Well, you could.

00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- think of a big
skeleton of a dinosaur.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:90%
You can crawl up that thing.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So because it had
angles and horizontals,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and perpendiculars, so you've
got ways of climbing up on it.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.615 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at Rudolph.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Said, can I climb
up on this thing?

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, first thing you hear
all the Air Force people, no.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
said thanks to him.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And the only time I
ever really thanked him.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:90%
So I crawl up on this thing.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm crawling on the bone,
wherever I'm touching the bone

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:90%
structure, nothing.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But the big smooth area
that recessed inside

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
that the bone structure's
protecting, when you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.530 align:middle line:90%
touched it--

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I swim with-- go to a
place where you swim

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.570 align:middle line:90%
with dolphins and all that.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It felt just like
a dolphin's skin.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.265 align:middle line:84%
And you push hard,
and I pushed on it,

00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
it would go in a little bit,
and then it's just like rock.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's like organic
covering with steel

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of
alloy on the inside.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So were
you about 25 feet up

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
when you got to the
top, off the ground?

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's 15 feet
high, 22 feet wide.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.283 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I was about 15 feet up.

00:02:55.283 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
About five foot more
than a basketball goal.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Which is pretty tall.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.159 align:middle line:90%
Don't want to fall off.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Definitely would feel it.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Right, you wouldn't--
it wouldn't kill you,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:90%
but you would be hurt.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.536 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You'd
definitely be hurt.

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:90%
So I crawl up on top.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But when I pull
myself up, I pushed

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:84%
against that smooth area,
and then the thing--

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:90%
it started reacting.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Wherever my skin would make
surface contact around my hand,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
cascading down inside would
be these really pretty

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.774 align:middle line:90%
blue and white waves.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:28.315 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like that
wave motion machine

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
you sit in front of
executives to keep them calm.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Little device you can buy.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Blue and white
as in, like, light?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Or what did it look like?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It had its
own illuminosity.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You could see it outside
of the other material.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
glowed a little bit,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and would run down its side.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:84%
You'd pull your hand
off of it, and it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
would dissipate at
the most outer reach,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and then come back to where
the original contact was,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.509 align:middle line:84%
and that'd be the final
area that would dissipate.

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you feel any
electrical charge or anything

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:90%
as that happened?

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Any heat?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No heat, but there
was something going on,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
because I noticed the hair
on my arm was standing up.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's-- but it wasn't
any electrical charge.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe static, but I
didn't get a shock.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.648 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You could definitely
feel something going on.

00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I lift off of it, and
I turned around and looked

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
at Rudolph, and I put my hand
on it, and they're watching it,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.280 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And the way their
faces look, it's--

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.057 align:middle line:90%
I looked at them, I said--

00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I took my hand off and I'm
looking at their faces,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and I take my hand back on it,
and they were looking at it,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, y'all haven't
seen this before, have you?

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And they got mad over that.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.334 align:middle line:84%
And so apparently, they
can't get a reaction.

00:04:50.334 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: It likes you.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I guess.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:84%
If it was a cat, it'd
be purring, I guess.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But I asked Rudolph,
can I climb up on top?

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And he says, go.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.705 align:middle line:90%
Air Force, no.

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:00.505 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go ahead.

00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:02.082 align:middle line:90%
So I get up on top.

00:05:02.082 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're walking
down what looks like--

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:90%
this is really weird--

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a giant spinal
column with vertebrates.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And there's
a bone plate that--

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I would say it was probably
about four feet wide,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and then the vertebrates
at-- and then

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:90%
it makes it very easy to walk.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So I just step over
the vertebrates.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I notice in
between the vertebrates,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
there's this big bundle of--
it looks like fiber optics.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really
fiber optics,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's got a fluid
running through it.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Now the best way I can
describe this fluid is

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
when we were kids, you'd
fall and hurt your knees,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.277 align:middle line:90%
get skinned.

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Your mom would come at
you with this bottle,

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to hate this,
cause it's called Merthiolate.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to burn like holy
fire when it hits your skin.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But the color of
Merthiolate was so unique.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.615 align:middle line:84%
It's bluish orange
green iridescent.

00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
You hold it up to
sunlight, the bottle,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.137 align:middle line:90%
it was gorgeous-looking.

00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, that's
the kind of fluid

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:90%
running through these tubes.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Weird.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.015 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And they
run all the way

00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
down the whole length
of the spinal column.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But then lean over and look
down, and it's really cool.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
These fibers break out of
the trunk case every other--

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
almost every vertebrate,
and they spread

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.322 align:middle line:90%
out running down its sides.

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you back up from
it, like down on the floor,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
you can see it clearly then,
it looked like a human's

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.654 align:middle line:90%
neural synaptic firing system.

00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you said they
looked like fiber optics.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So this-- that part
doesn't sound biological.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It just reminds me a little
of a lyric or in a song,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
"partly fact, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction."

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what this thing was.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Was it breathing?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That was
something I checked for.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Remember I put my hands on it?

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I stood there, and I
was being real quiet,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking for
a pulse or breathing.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Didn't feel anything.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But by God, it wouldn't
surprise me if I did.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.613 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If it sneezed,
I would have jumped.

00:07:14.613 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, I'm walking down it.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm heading toward--
and I think of a figure

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
eight, an hourglass, a
figure where they cross over.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.656 align:middle line:90%
Right at the crossover on--

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:84%
God, I don't know
what's front and back

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
on this thing-- but the
side facing out to us,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.135 align:middle line:90%
there was a hole that was deep.

00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A hole?

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.059 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: A hole.

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like it had
been shot and damaged?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And to make things
more confusing

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
in trying to figure it
out, something machine-like

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:84%
where you'd blow a hole in
it, the metal would be really

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.855 align:middle line:84%
sharp, shards and hanging
around the blast area,

00:07:56.855 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:90%
it would be really sharp.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I saw a picture once, and
it looked just like this.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
When they fire a harpoon into a
whale, it has a grenade charge,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:90%
and it detonates.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
God, what that must
feel like to that whale.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But they blew a big hole in the
whale, and you see a big hole.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And you see the blubber, right?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.846 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:08:19.846 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's what this
blast radius looked like.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It looked like blubber,
not shards of metal.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that-- now
that's starting to disturb me,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:90%
cause that looks like meat.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, man, what in--

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
you know, kept
asking them, I said--

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:90%
it's like, no, it's a machine.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:90%
No, it's organic.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a machine.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like you go back and
forth as you see things.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So I lean over the side
and look down the hole

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and asked Rudolph, can I
take a look inside the hole?

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are there any lights
or controls or visible--

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No, it's dark in there.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Which, I don't know why I even
wanted to go down in there.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of nuts to
think about it, why you

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:90%
want to crawl in a dark hole.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: No kidding.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Especially this
is already, like,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.638 align:middle line:84%
a scene from a
horror movie, right?

00:09:04.638 --> 00:09:05.882 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Well, I figured--

00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:07.631 align:middle line:84%
I figure at this point,
it doesn't matter.

00:09:07.631 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm gone anyhow, so--

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Rudolph, can
I go inside this hole?

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Boy, the Air Force people went
from no to definitely not.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph said, quiet.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go ahead.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.735 align:middle line:84%
And so I stepped down, and
I'm expecting it to be mushy,

00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:23.535 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:09:23.535 --> 00:09:24.335 align:middle line:90%
Give way.

00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did it
smell like anything?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There's
another good question.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
There was an overall
scent to the thing.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.525 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.525 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I know this is going to
really sound strange.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:90%
It smelled like baked goods.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.916 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Now you
expect some kind

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of chemical, metallic
odors and stuff, right?

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
No, this thing
smells like cookies.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.185 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what that is.

00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Weird.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: So I step on the--

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
on the torn flesh,
blubber, metal whatever.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you step on it,
it doesn't give it all.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
You can feel that it's like--

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.665 align:middle line:90%
almost like a rubber.

00:10:04.665 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
A real hardcore rubber, like
rubber on a tricycle tire,

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
man, what is this--

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
what is this thing made of?

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:90%
So I step down.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I squat down and just slip--

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and just as soon as I get to
the event horizon of the area,

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:90%
a light comes on inside.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like a blue light.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Very light baby blue.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
things down in there.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
this going, oh, man.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:84%
What-- whatever interacts
with this thing,

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be a bipedaled
anthropoid, because there's a--

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
the floor had a
platform that drops off.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a chair like
chairs we're sitting in,

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:90%
and you see our feet are here.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
That means we have
legs and knees bent.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So whoever is fooling with the
thing's built like me and you.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Same sized body?

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Bigger, smaller?

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Same--
about the same size.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: A little bit bigger
so it can accommodate you

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:90%
with some comfort.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:90%
So I slide on down in there.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it's
really interesting.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.297 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, this
is a power plant

00:11:18.297 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that would be inside a
spacecraft-- it's gotta be.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Blast came through
the hole of the craft,

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
came into the side
of the engine,

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.191 align:middle line:90%
blew its way into this area.

00:11:33.191 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I think this area
is is a diagnostic center.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.790 align:middle line:84%
It's where maintenance
people or crew members

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:90%
would sit down in this chair--

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
there's no chair there because
you can see some outlines--

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:90%
remnants of a chair.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But the blast came through,
come through the wall,

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.829 align:middle line:84%
through the chair, taking
it out, into this wall.

00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: About how big is this
room that you're in right now?

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.161 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: About the area
between me and you.

00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.135 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Oh, so
it's pretty small.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Like a cockpit.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So-- but this wall
over here on the right,

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
you're sitting down, there's,
like, an observation window,

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
which I thought was the coolest
thing, because if it's running,

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
that means you can see the
plasma flow in this thing.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:90%
That'd be so cool.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:90%
How cool would that be?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But the blast went
through the wall,

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and next thing you
encounter would

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
be the electromagnetic
shielding, the field.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Whatever blasted through
there, it either--

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:84%
the wall-- the field
stopped it or they

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:90%
both stopped at contact.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Cause as soon as
this made contact,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
simply because
that kind of blast

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
occurred and the
rest of it's intact,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:84%
you would have to shut
down in a picosecond,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:90%
about a trillionth of a second.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the engine
would have been vaporized

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:84%
by the heat that's
inside the plasma field,

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
inside the
electromagnetic field.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would survive.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.535 align:middle line:84%
So it shuts down
real-- a fail safe.

00:12:57.535 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
That's how you shut it
down in an emergency.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody was
shooting at this thing,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:90%
they knew exactly where to hit.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I mean, within an inch.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly where to
hit the thing to shut it down

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and still keep it intact.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you look for a
control surface with the seat?

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes, I did.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, I sat down in
what was left of the chair.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.585 align:middle line:84%
And right in front of me
are these two big pods

00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
about the size of a volleyball
if you cut it in half.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And they've got indentations,
and it's where your digits go.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
However, it wouldn't
be like that.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:84%
The only way you could
get your hands into it,

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:84%
us, you've got to put
these two fingers together.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's what you've got.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you set
it down, and you'll

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
sink down till the
top of your hands

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.704 align:middle line:84%
are even with the
surface of the pods.

00:13:48.704 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are you
saying that there

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
was more width in the area where
your two fingers go together?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.698 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, just enough
for you to sink down

00:13:54.698 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
into it to where the
top of your fingers

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:90%
are now flush with the pod.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:01.565 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So it was
obviously-- that's what

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to do.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.716 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, now this
is interesting, David,

00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:08.726 align:middle line:84%
because this sounds very,
very similar to what

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Schwarzenegger puts
his hand into at the end

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:90%
of "Total Recall."

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if they might
have borrowed that from you,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
because you might have done
this testimony before they

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
made that movie.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I remember seeing that.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.643 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Except his-- it's these
two fingers in "Total Recall"

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:90%
that he does, not these.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's very similar-sounding.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is how I did it.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but if I remember
"Recall" right,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.130 align:middle line:84%
next thing didn't
happen, I sat down.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I finally get my
hands settled in.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And no sooner than I
get them all settled,

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well, this is cool.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:90%
It fits.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:84%
These interlocking
rings came up like--

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.546 align:middle line:84%
I saw a Batman movie with
the Batmobile and its shield.

00:14:44.546 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, chink, chink,
chink, chink, chink, you know,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:90%
it's covered.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what it
did, except it was faster

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:90%
than the Batmobile.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.485 align:middle line:84%
It just went, you know,
ching, ching, ching, ching.

00:14:52.485 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was already
up to your knuckles.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And this
thing has got you.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Then all those rings
started tightening down.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.126 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, it's going
to cut my fingers off it it

00:15:02.126 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%
don't--

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:90%
So I started to yell for help.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- the interaction
with the thing was--

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:90%
that's what it was designed for.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Maintenance people would
put their hands in.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:90%
I didn't build it.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the language.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.584 align:middle line:84%
So it just-- you know, I just
wonder what they did with it.

00:15:23.584 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, it was
designed to maintenance.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And with that window to look
at the plasma field, obviously,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:90%
they would do alignments.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
That's something else I
saw in the plasma field.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I have these very
specialized plates

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that move the electromagnetic
field so I can--

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:90%
for efficiency.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
They had something that looked
like a tetrahedral turned

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
inside out.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were spaced
all along the walls,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
but they were all in line
of sight with each other.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.937 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's how they--

00:15:53.937 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they're doing.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you saw
tetrahedrons inside?

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you
mean, turned inside out?

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's the
way-- you know how

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:90%
they look like a Moravian star?

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Uh-huh.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: OK.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you take a Moravian
star and you do a reverse of it.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Spike would go this
way, it'd actually

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:90%
go in the other direction.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And I could tell--

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:24.484 align:middle line:84%
it's like some kind of reverse
matrix that's not known to us.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it had some
do with polarity

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic fields.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they were doing.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Didn't design it.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I guarantee you,
they were smarter than me.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Some the designs, though,
I saw throughout the thing,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:90%
I memorized.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So when I reassembled my own
version again, I cheated.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:90%
I was told their idea.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.699 align:middle line:90%
They had better ideas.

00:16:48.699 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So you must be scared.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.865 align:middle line:90%
This thing is-- pfft!

00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:52.889 align:middle line:84%
It's like, popped
over your hands.

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I just-- yeah,
I just about freaked out,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and I started to yell for help.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And it says-- there's
a voice I can hear.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And it says-- sounds
like Lauren Bacall.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.916 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Some female
sultry voice, and it says--

00:17:07.916 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
like Veronica Rabbit,
or something like that.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.403 align:middle line:90%
It just-- be quiet.

00:17:12.403 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
And it's a hold of it.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:90%
And I went, OK.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.327 align:middle line:90%
You know, like, oh, God.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:90%
You know, how stupid am I?

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
I crawled inside
an alien vehicle.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Stick my hands down in
it, grabs hold of me.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
God knows what's
going to happen next.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, I thought, I'm not
thinking through this stuff.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It's too much-- phrase
kept going through my head.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Curiosity's going to
kill the cat, you know?

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:42.065 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely
information exchanged.

00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember coming-- it was
really like an intense heat

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.720 align:middle line:90%
coming up my arms.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And when it got to where my
neck was, carotid artery,

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:84%
it's just like,
all of the sudden,

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
you have a head
that's up to yours.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And images you
see are just unbelievable.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make
sense of anything.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.015 align:middle line:90%
Saw different star systems.

00:18:11.015 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
One I came away
with is impressions.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
That's how I think it
talks to us, anyhow.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I guess we can't
speak their language,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:90%
so how else do you communicate?

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are beings of feelings.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole new world,
another way of communicating,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:90%
like body language.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is feelings
and impressions.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you see any
hieroglyphics or unusual

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:90%
writing like that?

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No, but I saw entire
civilizations, advanced worlds.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
This thing is a
power plant that is--

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:90%
it'll connect into a big craft.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Then you have a crew.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:90%
All three are sentient beings.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your power
plant's alive.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Your spacecraft is
alive and your crew,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and y'all interlock with
each other in a symbiotic

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: What a way to travel
through space, God almighty.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much eliminate the
need for damage control.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.872 align:middle line:84%
You get in some trouble,
get hit or something,

00:19:17.872 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
you're the captain
sitting in the bridge.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't need somebody
to tell you where the--

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
you know where we've been
hit because you feel it.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of it.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
You know somebody blew
a hole in your side.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:90%
You would know it.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And even if you
didn't have visuals,

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
you could tell where the
enemy is anywhere around you.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Man, wouldn't the Navy
like to get a hold of that?

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I thought-- you know,
what felt like maybe hours.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I was there
just a few minutes,

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
because the people downstairs
didn't even seem to be,

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, alerted it was
long or even that I'd

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:90%
been in there too long.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:90%
So I come out.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And soon I got to the opening,
the light goes back down.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Just, like, shuts off.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of, you know, sensory.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: I'm curious, though.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to see
in these visions what

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.220 align:middle line:84%
these people originally
looked like or anything

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.269 align:middle line:90%
about their civilization?

00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:90%
What the buildings were--

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, there were a few
things that stuck in my head.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, this symbiotic
society, it's old, man.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not thousands of years.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not a million years.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
This thing's, like, eight
or nine billion years old.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's the oldest thing
there is in the universe.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's just--

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
it's the first of the
species of the universe.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Not just the galaxy,
the entire universe.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And home to them is
the space between the galaxies.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Kind of like a whale
living deep in the ocean.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where these
things reside, I guess.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're a mixture
of kind like--

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:90%
now that we know it--

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:90%
kind of like the Borg.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:84%
They're a mixture of birth
and construct all together,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.487 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:21:21.487 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you get
a sense that they

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:90%
were a positive people?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Not like a warlock, evil race?

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:90%
But apparently, I can't--

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
just images, impressions.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But this thing must have been
in a knock-down, drag-out battle

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And it got wounded, and
that's the best word for it.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
It got wounded in a conflict,
and so it's looking for a place

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:90%
to land.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, repair
itself or heal up.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't what it does.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Where are we as a
planet in our galaxy?

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:90%
We're right on the very edge.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:90%
It flew into our galaxy.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
First planet it came on, M
class planet probably been us.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:90%
So it slides in.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.469 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
found this thing.

00:22:14.469 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have been capable
of shooting something like that

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.810 align:middle line:90%
down probably.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Nah.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:90%
They dug it up.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why they built
Area 51 where it's at,

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
because they hit a
treasure trove, which

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
means the spacecraft is
somewhere, and it's big.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
follow that matrix,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that means the crew's
somewhere around.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think that a
reactor like this could power--

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
would have enough
energy density to power

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:90%
an entire city like Los Angeles?

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.032 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Not just city.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:90%
It could power an entire planet.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You know,
carriers come in.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, one of our naval
carriers went to Beirut,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and they ran their
reactors into Beirut,

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and ran the whole
power supply of Beirut

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:84%
till they got the
infrastructure up.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The place has been
just bombed to death.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
This thing could
land on a planet.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
This power plant can
be extracted easily.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:84%
It's only got four disconnects
and lifts right out.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So you could drop it off and
power an entire planet with it.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.197 align:middle line:90%
So it's just--

00:23:20.197 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
power the thing's got.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Imagine not just a yellow
star like ours to medium star.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And you pour a million Earths
inside the thing it's so big.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I think this thing's got
the power of a giant blue.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:90%
It's just unlimited.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't imagine
what weaponry of something

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But the thing never seemed
to have a need for weaponry.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe defense.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I crawled
out of this thing,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and I had a different attitude.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
That was an excellent question
you asked me, was I scared?

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I never was scared of this
device or anything in Area 51.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I was more scared of Arthur
Rudolph than anything.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So I got out, but
I am so angry when

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I come crawling
out of that thing,

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess because
I've seen so much.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And what hit me is that,
nobody knows about this.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has a right to keep
this kind of knowledge

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:90%
away from everybody.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I stop and I talk
to these guys again,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force people and
Rudolph, and finally--

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I just-- they asked
me something, and--

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:90%
oh.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to say, did
I learn anything in there

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that I could tell them
how this functions?

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:90%
And that was the last straw.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I just yelled down
to them, look.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:90%
This thing is not ours.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.249 align:middle line:90%
It's not theirs, the Soviets.

00:24:46.249 --> 00:24:48.415 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, it's
not from the neighborhood,

00:24:48.415 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:90%
is it, guys?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, and how old is it?

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:90%
How long have you had it?

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:90%
And did you shoot it down?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Did you dig it up?

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Boy, now they're bristling,
and they are furious.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care anymore at
this point, because I told them,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
nobody, I mean nobody, no
president, no head of state

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
has a right to withhold
this kind of knowledge

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.419 align:middle line:90%
from the entire human race.

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said this out
loud as you're standing up--

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a good place to--

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: In the
middle of Area 51?

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah,
it's a good place--

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.115 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:24.115 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't thought of
it till you said that.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I guess I was stump preaching.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Man, look at the stump
you're standing on.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.350 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.110 align:middle line:90%
I just had this--

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm normally very
easygoing and everything.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%
But boy, at that moment,
I am just furious.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying things,
I thought, David,

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:90%
did you just say that to them?

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and I'm pissed off.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're angry.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me, get
off the damn thing.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm coming down, and
when I put my hand back

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
on the smooth area on the
innards of this thing,

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:04.070 align:middle line:84%
as soon as my skin hit it,
cascading 20 or 30 feet

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
down the side of this thing, way
longer than the blue and white,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
now it's red, orange
flames going down,

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.535 align:middle line:84%
halfway down this thing's
body, wherever my contact is.

00:26:16.535 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I pulled it back, slapped
it on again, and it's there.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm marveling
at what's happening,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:90%
it starts retracting back down.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Then it turns back to blue and
white because I'm coming down.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:84%
This thing is not heat
sensitive recognition alloy.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:84%
This thing is
feelings recognition.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:90%
This thing feels me.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:45.577 align:middle line:84%
It knows when I'm easygoing
and when I'm really pissed off.

00:26:45.577 --> 00:26:46.910 align:middle line:90%
How in the hell does it do that?

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It's interacting.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, we cut
down off of the engine.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.030 align:middle line:84%
All they tell me
is, get on the cart.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Get in the back.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, just real curt.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So I get in the back,
and I'm facing outward,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and they're driving forward.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to back
up the causeway, back up

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to the elevator so
we can go back up

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.585 align:middle line:90%
to the roof, the other floor.

00:27:12.585 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I hear
these guys whispering,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:84%
because the wind's blowing
past them past my ear.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I can hear them, and they
don't think I can hear them,

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:21.282 align:middle line:90%
and I hear everything.

00:27:21.282 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
you know, we've

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.920 align:middle line:84%
got to get him to help us
figure out how this engine works

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
or get him to replicate another
engine like mine so they

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
can have one to take apart
and one to have working.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And that way, they
have a completed cycle,

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and they can start
mass producing.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said they need it
for the first rank fleet.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, God.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:90%
How many do they plan to build?

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many nuclear
warheads did we have in 1971?

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.560 align:middle line:90%
4,000?

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:90%
So they want my speed.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:90%
How do you-- how do you win MAD?

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.542 align:middle line:90%
MAD, Mutual Assured Destruction.

00:28:04.542 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It's what we live
under, have lived

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:90%
under since the Trinity test.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The only answer to
winning MAD is speed.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Whoever strikes first and
strikes the fastest wins.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just gave them
the vehicle they need.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I
thought, I'm trying

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:90%
to build you a power plant.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
You want to go nuke
half the planet--

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:90%
because they're not thinking.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:84%
If you nuke the
Soviets, who are you

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
kill that same day?

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:90%
China.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Now you're looking at 50% of
the population of the planet.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking is
a worldwide military coup,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and we will be reigning kings.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%
That's horrifying.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:90%
That's worse than the Germans.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm getting
even more pissed,

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
because I'm trying to
give you unlimited energy,

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.874 align:middle line:84%
clean, change the
carbon footprints.

00:28:57.874 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a tree hugger.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.305 align:middle line:90%
I'm a science person, you know?

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I build things.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But this is good for you,
your kids, your grandkids.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You'll bring carbon
footprint to a halt.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Another thing this
engine can do,

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I can go send one over to Yucca
Mountain, burn all of its waste

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
into my reactor, give
you energy, and get

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:90%
rid of the waste forever.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, man, this thing could
really change this place.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And here they want to
make a weapon system out

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:90%
of it so we can--

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.220 align:middle line:84%
so that's all they
think when you first

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:90%
discover nuclear power.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with it?

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Build a nuclear power plant.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
No, you blow a
hole in the ground.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.226 align:middle line:90%
So it just really pissed me off.

00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm riding up to the
surface on the elevator

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking, I've
got to blow my rocket up.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:90%
This just sucks.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Took me 26 months
to build this thing.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.510 align:middle line:90%
It came out of me.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it's like
you have a child.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And now because of
their moronic ways,

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.070 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to kill your child.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.782 align:middle line:90%
That sucks.

00:30:04.782 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So I get up to the
hangar [INAUDIBLE]----

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.865 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now Curtis
LeMay was one

00:30:07.865 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
of the joint chiefs of staff,
I believe, during John F.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.084 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy's administration.

00:30:12.084 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's right.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about
the highest levels

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
of the American command
structure that want

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.095 align:middle line:90%
to use this for first strike.

00:30:19.095 --> 00:30:20.095 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's correct.

00:30:20.095 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I can see where you're
going with this.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.152 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:30:23.152 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm just an average guy.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just realize,
everything's getting perverted.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
do destruction.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.010 align:middle line:84%
How much have we learned
from all the wars?

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Not a damn thing, except how
to kill more efficiently.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So here's the problem
with, how do you blow up

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
a rocket on a top-secret
Air Force base,

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and you've got nothing
but your clothes?

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there,
trying to think.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, God.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.198 align:middle line:90%
Come up with something.

00:30:53.198 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't let them
walk away with this.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:90%
So I saw the answer.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
We pull up-- the elevator
levels out up at the top.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:90%
We're back in a hangar.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So I walk over to
the hangar doors

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and I look down at the
wheel near the hub.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of lean down like
I'm sitting against the door

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and reach down and get a
handful of graphite grease.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Ask anybody what happens when
graphite meets deuterium.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.742 align:middle line:90%
It's a violent reaction.

00:31:25.742 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So I start screaming
and hollering,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
see my rocket again.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take
it away from me.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Just being a whiny little
thing, because Rudolph

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.867 align:middle line:90%
can't handle that.

00:31:32.867 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, at least let
me see it once before--

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and he told the two guards,
take him on the cart

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:90%
and go out there.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I need to check the
engine out there anyhow.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So we went out there, just
me and these two guards.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.154 align:middle line:90%
So we drive up.

00:31:48.154 --> 00:31:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know what?

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:84%
You guys mind staying
in the cart here?

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:90%
This thing may be leaking.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Them guards aren't
going to move.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:55.570 align:middle line:90%
So I get out.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I go in.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I open up the induction
chamber, slide in the graphite.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be pulled
into the cyclotrons

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.761 align:middle line:84%
and the cycle will
start up 90 seconds.

00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Hope that's enough time.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.426 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So I set it for
90 seconds, close the door,

00:32:10.426 --> 00:32:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and you hear it winding.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:13.700 align:middle line:90%
I turn around to these guards.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Go, oh my God.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.640 align:middle line:90%
It's leaking.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear that wind?

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:90%
It's going to detonate.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:84%
We get in that car, and man,
they are leaning forward,

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:84%
See how fast they can
get-- we were just touching

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.560 align:middle line:90%
high spots on the ground.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:90%
[ENGINE RUNNING]

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh my gosh.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.473 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And he asked me a
really good question like you

00:32:31.473 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:90%
asked.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.035 align:middle line:90%
What's a safe distance?

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:34.835 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:32:34.835 --> 00:32:36.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting there going--

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
because-- oh God,
if it goes nuclear.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I went, Chicago.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And the guards look at each
other, and they lean forward,

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.720 align:middle line:90%
We go hell flying through there.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And more likely be killed in
this damn cart than the blast.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But we get up to the hangars,
and boy, Pitholem she

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:90%
detonates.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And it blows a hole the
size of a football field,

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.190 align:middle line:90%
about 100 feet deep.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Did not go nuclear.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:90%

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.271 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Just convention.

00:33:04.271 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But biggest piece
they found out there,

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.389 align:middle line:90%
about the size of my thumb.

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How loud was it?

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.212 align:middle line:84%
Did you have some
hearing damage?

00:33:13.212 --> 00:33:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: As a matter of--

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:84%
man, those are fabulous
questions you ask.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have permanent hearing

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Kind of handy, though.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I could be laying in
a room and there's

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:90%
a cricket I can't hear it.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else is going, God,
I can't stand that cricket.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:34.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:90%
What cricket?

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But we hear in mid range
and low range, I'm fine.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:90%
But the ultrasonics, gone.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No one
ever asked me that.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's real.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:90%
This is real stuff.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Real permanent damage,
real reactions.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So even the audiologist,
when he took my reading,

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.700 align:middle line:90%
he went, man, what hit you?

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, the way your inner
ears and the stirrups--

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
it must have been an
ultra high-pitch--

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:84%
must have been one
whale of an explosion.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.873 align:middle line:90%
I went, yeah, it was.

00:34:10.873 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, I get back
up there, and now I'm

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:84%
going to show you
how smart Rudolph is.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:21.260 align:middle line:84%
He just looking at this,
you know, mini nuclear cloud

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.949 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at the guards,
and he said, what happened?

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
He says it was leaking.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.909 align:middle line:84%
Now he knows these
things don't leak.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So he's looking at me,
and he grabs my hand

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and rolls the hand over, and
he looks at the hangar door.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:90%
That's fast.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:90%
And he just looked at me--

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.900 align:middle line:90%
very clever.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he just hits
me so hard my lower

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.530 align:middle line:90%
teeth pushed through my lip.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And I hit the ground, and I'm
spitting blood everywhere.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I've got a really nice
looking scar inside.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I hear all
these guns cocking.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.660 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, man.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Just at this point, just
go ahead and shoot me.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.797 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:35:05.797 --> 00:35:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I roll over and look up,
and guess where all the gun

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:90%
barrels are pointing?

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.440 align:middle line:90%
At Rudolph.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: These are
Air Force personnel.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:90%
He's a Nazi.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:84%
He just smacked the heck
out of a Midwest Ohio boy

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.060 align:middle line:84%
in front of these
Air Force people.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.422 align:middle line:90%
And I look up, and I went--

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:25.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, just
bleeding everywhere.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And I look up, and I
went, well, Rudolph, I

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.585 align:middle line:84%
guess you're not in
charge after all.

00:35:30.585 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, these guys
looked like they ain't through

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:90%
with World War II yet.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And he had men in black
there, and they grabbed me.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:90%
And off we go.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And we go through the
hangar, go through an office

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:90%
area, and then down a hallway.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm put in this room
where there's no windows.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Just a door, light bulb hanging
from the ceiling on wiring.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Uh-oh.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And they
slammed the door shut.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going,
man, I'm in bad shape.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Rudolph,
on the way there,

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.020 align:middle line:84%
he just wanted to
get his point in.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.500 align:middle line:90%
He says, just a minute.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I want you to see something.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So we go in this
lab-looking thing.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a cadaver laying there.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Pulls it back, it's a
17-year-old male, he tells me.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, we're going to
change the dental records

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:90%
to match yours.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:22.698 align:middle line:84%
We're going to burn
this thing to a crisp

00:36:22.698 --> 00:36:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and send it back to
your parents saying

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that you burned in an
accident at White Sands,

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to stay
here the rest of your life.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a sociopath
you're talking to.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And that's when I--
they locked me in that room,

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.700 align:middle line:90%
and I started crying.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm only 17.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.020 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was done.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Who is going to come
and rescue me, you know?

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Bell is meanwhile
locked in his quarters

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:90%
at White Sands.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:84%
But I found out he broke
loose, overpowered the guards,

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.210 align:middle line:90%
and called LeMay.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:84%
LeMay's in route to
Area 51 right now.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't
know this, Area 51's

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
under the command of SAC,
Strategic Air Command.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So who appointed
all the commanding officers?

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.870 align:middle line:90%
LeMay did.

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:90%
So he ain't asking.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:90%
He's just flying straight in.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And I hear a lot of
ruckus out in the hallway,

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and the door flies open, and
all I see is a silhouette.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Big square shoulders
and somebody

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:90%
doing this with a big stogie.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.560 align:middle line:10%
And if you've ever seen any
pictures of LeMay you would go,

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.540 align:middle line:10%
that's Curtis LeMay.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.450 align:middle line:10%
He's got a hold of a tie.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.806 align:middle line:84%
The tie is around a full
board colonel of the Air Force

00:37:35.806 --> 00:37:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that he's been slinging
back and forth.

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the banging I heard.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was banging this colonel
who's commander of the base.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And he's so furious.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:90%
He appointed this commander.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.270 align:middle line:10%
So all the commander
knows, civilian or not,

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.720 align:middle line:10%
that's a four star--

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.110 align:middle line:10%
chief of the joint chief's
got you by your tie.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.420 align:middle line:10%
And he looked down at
me, and I'm just a mess.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And he looked back
at that colonel,

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that colonel quickly said, we
had nothing to do with that.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph and these
other guys did.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:90%
He said, where's he at?

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:90%
He just left.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Find him.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And get him cleaned up,
put him on my plane.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And we flew from Gruene Lake
to Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And they put me in
the general's car

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and drove me back to my
house in Mount Vernon, Ohio.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I spent my summer
vacation in my junior year

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.650 align:middle line:90%
in high school.

to write that up with--

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I am a raising senior,
went back to school--

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: They?

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Who asked you to write it up.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
what did you do for
your summer vacation?

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

yeah, well, I invented the
fastest rocket on Earth,

00:38:45.835 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and I met this madman
Nazi war criminal that's

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:84%
been riding me all the way, and
I'm working with a four star

secret Air Force base

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and I blew up the missile,
and saw an alien power plant.
