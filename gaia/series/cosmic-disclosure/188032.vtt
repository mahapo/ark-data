>>EMERY SMITH: Welcome.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.365 align:middle line:10%
My name's Emery Smith
with "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:10%
and today, we're going to be
talking about ET interventions.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.408 align:middle line:10%
David, thanks for coming.

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Glad to be here.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.283 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what's
going on out there?

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:30.983 align:middle line:84%
You can tell me
anything you like

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that has to do
with interventions,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.703 align:middle line:90%
but where did it all start?

00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
What was your first experience
that you noticed there were

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:90%
some intervention going on?

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The
interventions that I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.215 align:middle line:84%
think they're doing for the
most part seems to be positive,

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
negative ones out there.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about Command
Sergeant Major Dean?

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar
with his experience?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes, I am.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Bob Dean.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Bob was, he was a
really good friend of mine.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:10%
For years, I kept his
messages on my machine.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:10%
Up to his death, I talked
to him once a month.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was Bob's
experience with the craft?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: He was reluctant
to share some of that.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that's because he
was still a good soldier.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:90%
He's been a good soldier.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But he was very curious
about what went on with me,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and he asked an awful
lot of questions.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of the
interventions from the aliens

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:90%
have been positive.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And from what I can
gather from Bob,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
there is multiple races
out there, multiple ships,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:90%
multiple agendas.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I
don't know if we're

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:90%
being monitored or protected.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.587 align:middle line:90%
I suspect we are because--

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We're still here.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, the
fact we're still here

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and we hadn't killed
ourselves is one part.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that something
had landed here and just

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
raped us to death and
killed us, people think,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
well, we're so far out
in the distance, so vast,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't be there.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I think there's pirate
races, intergalactic pirates,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
terrorists, whatever
you call them,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and they just go from planet
to planet destroying stuff.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, why haven't
we been taken out?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, we stick out like a--

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
we're a big blue marble,
big blue and white marble

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:90%
in the blackness of space.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.445 align:middle line:84%
Lord have mercy, we got to
show up on radars everywhere.

00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:35.075 align:middle line:84%
And the fact we're still here,
somebody is looking out for us.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:36.325 align:middle line:90%
I am certain of that because--

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of
any landings or meetings

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.212 align:middle line:90%
taking place?

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Not really,
not firsthand.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Not
firsthand, of course.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But I've heard
stories like everybody else.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Anything recent?

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, yeah, we
should have bought it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:90%
on July 23, 2012.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Look that up, read up on it.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
That's nobody's hearsay,
somebody made it up.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all real.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But we should've
bought that day, y'all.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.695 align:middle line:90%
You should have died.

00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
All of us, we should
have been gone.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And people are
probably sitting there,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:90%
what is he talking about?

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
On July 23, we had
not one, not two,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
but three CMEs coming
straight at Earth

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
in a line, three
of them in a row.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.922 align:middle line:90%
The perfect storm.

00:03:28.922 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:90%
And what's a CME?

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a Coronal Mass Ejection.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as when you take
your hand to your forehead

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and you wipe the sweat
off, then you just sling it

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:90%
off your hands.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:90%
It's got little beads of sweat.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, beads of sweat like
that come off the sun

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
as it's rotating, but this
little bead of sweat has got

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:90%
some lump to it, y'all.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
This bead is the size and
mass of Mount Everest,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's a ball of plasma
that's coming at Earth.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And they generally travel
just below light speed.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
They'll cover 93 million
miles in 14 hours or less.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, these three CMEs
come hurling in at us,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and they came 93
million miles away,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
and they were going
to hit us dead center.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Then, we have a word
we use in science

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
when we can't
explain something--

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Something bumped them.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Something.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Something.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Something,
I don't know what,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm open up
to any suggestions

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%
because it's a phenomenon.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But these things just
deflected a little bit,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:90%
but it was enough.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But they passed so
close when they went by,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
they were between
us and the moon.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:90%
They were only 110,000--

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.715 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's
very extremely close

00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about these things.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: When they come
from 93 million miles away

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and they pass by
only 110,000 miles,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:90%
something bumped these things.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You were given an
explanation, though, recently.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that, of how
we avoided this catastrophe?

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: In a panel I was
on recently for Antarctica,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe said she
had some whistleblowers that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
said there was a big
ship out there that

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:90%
deflected the things.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there, so I don't know.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:90%
But sounds good to me.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:84%
All I know is, something caused
these things to deflect right

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%
at the last minute.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.916 align:middle line:90%
And how serious was this?

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
This story wasn't released
until two years after the event.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
It happened in 2012,
and it wasn't till 2014

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that the press even
talked about it.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you do the math,
this is really interesting.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
If those three CMEs hit on
July 23, six months later

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
probably the last human being
would've died on the planet

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
because everything
would have been gone,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:90%
and the sun's blotted out.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And that last person
would have died probably

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:90%
on December 21, 2012.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:90%
The Mayans were right.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:90%
We should have died.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Something intervened.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Something, I don't know what.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:90%
But that CME event did occur.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not BS.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It really happened.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Verified by NOAA, NASA, and
about a dozen other countries

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:90%
that saw it, was mapping it in.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:90%
This was a real event.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we have
any technologies

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that you're aware of that
could have pulled this off?

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Not that I'm aware of.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And for them to
just change course

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
without seeing any flash or any
physical currents out there,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:90%
no, I don't know what did it.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking of Mr.
Spock and the Enterprise

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:90%
may have came in.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Something happened that
caused it to change course.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But that day is also
interesting is because it

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:90%
was so quiet on the news level.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Nothing mentioned
about any of this.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's a major--

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who knew about it in
this compartmentalized section?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Just NOAA?

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No, the entire
federal government knew.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They were having an open
house at Mount Weatherby.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So they were moving in
with their families,

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to close
the doors and let us burn.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.705 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our government is
just as low as scumbags

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:29.098 align:middle line:90%
as you could meet.

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
They wasn't even going
to tell us about it.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
want you panicking

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and be on the roads
and they couldn't

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:90%
get to Mount Weatherby.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.215 align:middle line:84%
You want to talk
about Mount Weatherby?

00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Mount Weatherby is
a huge underground facility

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:46.475 align:middle line:10%
that's designed to save Congress
and the Senate and everybody

00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:10%
that's State of the Union--

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.548 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: And where
is it located?

00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I think it's Virginia.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.879 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It is Virginia, yes.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:55.046 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how much it can
hold, how many families?

00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It can hold the entire
State of the Union address.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Everybody.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.175 align:middle line:84%
Congress, the
Senate, the Cabinet.

00:08:03.175 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This is
absolutely true.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.438 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The Supreme Court
and all of their families.

00:08:08.438 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's a facility that's
just sitting there waiting

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:90%
for them to run into it.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Fine time to have an open house
when you got three CMEs coming.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
God, the blatant of it
is just unbelievable.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why didn't the
other countries and observation

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:84%
corporations that are out
there looking up at the stars,

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
why did they not release
this information?

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's an
excellent question.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's why it was
really confusing to me.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:84%
There must be some
kind of lockdown

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to an ELV,
Extinction Level Event,

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
is what this was, where they're
just not going to tell us

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:90%
anything, the whole world.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's so they can
all run to their bunkers.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.137 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's nice, isn't it?

00:08:53.137 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, thank
god for that bump

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and wherever it came from.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.300 align:middle line:84%
There's something to be
said on a very positive note

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:90%
about Jupiter and Saturn.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:90%
They're Jovian planets.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:90%
It means they're gas planets.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But because their
mass and their size,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
they got a gravity field
that just won't quit.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
When Shoemaker-Levy 9 came
in and struck Jupiter,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
it blew a hole in Jupiter
the size of Earth.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of that stuff,
all those comets,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:90%
they were all heading for Earth.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter pulled them into it
because of its gravity field.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for
Jupiter and Saturn,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:90%
we'd been dead long ago.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
You really like big gas
giants in the solar system

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
because they collect a
lot of trash and debris

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
before it makes it to
a small planet like us.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But the odds of the three
CMEs changing course,

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:90%
you got me on that one.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
I have no explanation.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And anybody's
explanation is good

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
because I have no way explaining
why they changed course.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:90%
We should have died.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We all should have died at
that moment, but we didn't.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's a strong case
for ET intervention.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.457 align:middle line:84%
There must be something
better for us in the future,

00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
or they wouldn't
have taken the effort

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:90%
to save our bacon like that.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:23.802 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, I believe we
have had an intervention.

00:10:23.802 --> 00:10:25.135 align:middle line:90%
Too bad we don't know who it is.

00:10:25.135 --> 00:10:26.677 align:middle line:84%
We should send them
a thank you card.

00:10:26.677 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, something.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Send them some
flowers, something.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But man, that was
a grand moment.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And don't think that that
would count for another 20,000

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.245 align:middle line:90%
years we have another event.

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:43.545 align:middle line:84%
CMEs are coming off
the sun all the time.

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All the time.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And the odds of
us getting hit is absolute.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.323 align:middle line:90%
It's not if, it's when.

00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's just
when, matter of time.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.465 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the
safest place to be?

00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:55.242 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The
interesting about CME,

00:10:55.242 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:84%
a CME has never harmed any
plant life or animal life,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
but what it is really
hard on is electronics.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Anything electronic,
it's had it.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:10%
So back in the storm
of 1869 in September,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:10%
when that CME came in,
the Carrington Event,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:10%
the only thing we
had was what they

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:10%
call the Victorian
Internet-- telegraph wires.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:10%
The telegraph wire, it
caught it pretty bad,

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:10%
and the little line
checks caught on fire.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
The wires caught fire,
fell to the ground.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.178 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They just
had to stomp out

00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
some small fires, build a couple
line checks, and that was it.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:90%
They re-strung the wires.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Now fast forward to today,
walk outside and look up.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Your entire power
grid is 40 feet

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
in the air sitting on telephone
poles, just saying, hit me.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes in, we
have set our own selves up

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.108 align:middle line:90%
for annihilation.

00:11:52.108 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You were really good
friends with Robert Dean,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
so explain a little bit more to
me some of his amazing events

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that have happened that
he shared with you.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: He did bring
up some that you just

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:90%
can't explain them.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
UFOs that show up and
shut down our ICBMs.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.508 align:middle line:84%
And they're not just
turning the ICBMs off,

00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:90%
they're rendering them useless.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Useless.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's a clear message
that they could disable us

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:84%
at any time for
a defense system.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:84%
If they were hostile,
we'd already be smoked.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:90%
We'd be done.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So then the not
hostile nature is just

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
showing you the power
that they possess

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and the futility that we
have with defense systems.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
We think we got all this
nuclear warhead power

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and we could be bad to the bone,
and they just simply come in

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and shut everything off.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Also, it might be
a clear warning

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.257 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't be messing with
this kind of stuff because--

00:12:52.257 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It'll destroy us.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, we're like a baby
with a handgun that's loaded.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.940 align:middle line:90%
We're stupid.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
If I was an alien race, I'd be
frustrated with the human race

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:84%
because we do such
stupid things,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and we just don't
know any better.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious as why they
think we're so special.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because I believe that
they were once us at one time.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's going to have
to be something like that,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
some kind of connection,
because I once said in a panel

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.935 align:middle line:84%
we're a bunch of monkeys
that turned into Nazis.

00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that was great.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Not exactly
saying a whole lot for us,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
but I'm more cynical on
the human race at times.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But I also agree
it's worth salvaging.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And as bad as we look, there's
that constant eternal struggle

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:90%
we have with ourselves.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.425 align:middle line:90%
We're capable of such beauty.

00:13:55.425 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Amazing,
beautiful, creative things.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, music and art.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And then look what
we can do in war.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's hard to believe
it's the same being that's

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:90%
capable of doing both.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:84%
That could be a curiosity
thing that brings aliens here.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But back to our nuclear
defense systems,

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
they're constantly showing
how vulnerable that thing is

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and how easy it is
to shut it down.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
There's been one episode
after another of reports UFOs

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
show up outside
the bases of silos,

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and the machinery just
shuts off or can't function.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Where at?

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Give me an example
that this has happened.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Malmstrom
has a famous series

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of missiles there
called Missile Row,

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and that entire row shut down.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.695 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
14, 15 warheads.

00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And that would scare
the daylights out of me,

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
if I were the general and
I just saw my biggest,

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:84%
baddest weapons just turn
off like a light switch.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
What if you got to fight
something like that?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%
You ain't got a chance.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's very humbling,
which I think

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of alien interventions
are designed to try to humble us

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:90%
because we're so arrogant.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, we
have this big ego.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.422 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, man, it's just--

00:15:12.422 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We have to be the
first and have the biggest guns.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, biggest,
baddest, and there's

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:90%
nothing can stop us.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And we can go anywhere,
we do what we want.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.155 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't work that way.

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:23.955 align:middle line:90%
We need to learn.

00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's the other thing.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't learn.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.277 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I think they're
trying to allow us to learn.

00:15:29.277 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:90%
We're just not getting it.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Stick
around long enough.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, I think that's
one of the ET interventions.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
If you can save the idiots
long enough from themselves,

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.195 align:middle line:84%
like a child, they
might grow out of it

00:15:42.195 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and take more responsibilities
for themselves.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I like to think there's a
change going on nowadays.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in
our own country.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
We have never been
so separated now,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's like the line in the
sand is really being drawn.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can clearly see
the two sides forming.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
interesting to see

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:84%
what happens because
there just isn't

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
enough space for
both of the sides

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:90%
to exist at the same time.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Something's going
to have to give.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.675 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
compromise is going to be.

00:16:21.675 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's probably what
the aliens are

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to engineer or to pull
off some kind of compromise.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:32.985 align:middle line:84%
But right now, it
doesn't bode well for us.

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: At this rate,
we're destroying the planet,

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
destroying ourselves, and
we're still making bombs.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.093 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we kind of didn't
learn our lesson, I think.

00:16:42.093 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: I don't know if
you know the story of James

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:10%
Cameron in "The Abyss."

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:10%
He had a dream that
would not stop.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.186 align:middle line:10%
He had it every night, and
it was bothering him so much,

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:57.320 align:middle line:10%
he was trying to get
psychiatric help and--

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Yeah, wrap
his head around this.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
The dream to him was these
giant tidal waves showed up

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:84%
on every coastline of
every country in the world,

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and they'd rise about three
miles high right up to a point

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:90%
and stop.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So he made the movie
"The Abyss," which

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:90%
is exactly that situation.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.880 align:middle line:84%
After he made the movie "The
Abyss" and it was released,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
the dream stopped.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.608 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was
an intervention.

00:17:25.608 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's definitely
an intervention from--

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: The message was clear.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Stop trashing the oceans.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.433 align:middle line:84%
The aliens that were living
in the Challenger Deep,

00:17:36.433 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:90%
they had enough of us.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And they could easily
wipe us almost completely

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
out by just doing
sheer tidal waves.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.725 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And that
was interesting

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that Cameron got that dream like
that, and he proceeded with it.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And in real life,
he still is going.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
He is the only one that's
went to Challenger Deep.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:90%
The Navy couldn't even do it.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
He built this new
bathysphere that's

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.995 align:middle line:90%
capable of 47,000 feet down.

00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:02.795 align:middle line:90%
That's insane.

00:18:02.795 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was one of the
biggest interventions I ever

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
saw was Cameron trying to tell
us something about the oceans.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does China, have they
had any specific interventions

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can mention on camera
that you know of recently

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:90%
that have happened over there?

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And what is their take
on this whole contact?

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: As a country, they're
moving further than we are.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Three decades ago, I addressed
China's science symposium,

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and I gave them the
most detailed layout

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
of how to excavate Helium-3
from the surface of the moon.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess where
they are right now?

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
They're on the moon
excavating Helium-3.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Probably there's
robots up there,

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
if I could get a
look at one, probably

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
the very one I designed and
drew on the board for them.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But at least they
took it to heart

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and did something about it.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how important
is this Helium-3 to us

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth and everywhere?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.457 align:middle line:90%
Explain.

00:19:14.457 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I guess there's
a phrase that said,

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:84%
he who controls Helium-3
will control the world.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Helium-3 is an isotope
of helium that's

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.735 align:middle line:84%
been modified by
the heat of the sun,

00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's distributed
through the solar system

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:90%
by the solar winds.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Now we have Van Allen
radiation belts,

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
we got layers of
atmosphere, and we

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
get very little to
practically none Helium-3.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
However, the moon sitting
next to us has no atmosphere,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and it has slammed
into the surface of it

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:90%
many times, millions of times.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
The rocks are saturated
with Helium-3.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So what's important
about Helium-3?

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
If you can get enough of
it together and put it

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:84%
into a reactor, that reactor's
efficiency will probably

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:84%
quadruple, and
you're going to have

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:90%
very little to no radiation.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So clean thermal
fusion fission power.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:90%
What a dream.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, beautiful.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're going in that
direction, you could say?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I would think so
because we're so committed

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.037 align:middle line:84%
to the fusion fission
industry, and we really

00:20:22.037 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have went there.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
That was a decision
made back in the '50s.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how much of H-3
would we actually need to power

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:90%
the planet, let's say?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: This is
where it gets good.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
You could take with
the Lunar Rover design

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I made, it's like a moon mover,
like an earth mover machine,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and this thing could
sweep an area no bigger

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:90%
than a football field.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But you'd get enough Helium-3
off that football field

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:84%
scraping that you could
run all the energy

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
needs of a country like the size
of China for about 10 years,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's just
a small fraction.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And think of the
money that you'd make.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it keeps
replenishing itself.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It does.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Just if
you scrape it down,

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
how long does it take
for me to come back

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and dig the same
scraping or dig a hole?

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If you start right back
over where you started from,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.230 align:middle line:84%
it's already filled back up
because the solar winds are

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:90%
constant out there.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And we learned about
this decades ago and just

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:90%
haven't moved on it.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it's almost
like a conscience effort.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:84%
That's an extremely good
reason to go back to the moon.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But no, NASA don't want
to talk about that.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:50.428 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:21:50.428 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You don't
see any symposiums

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:90%
held by NASA on Helium-3.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We don't want that kind
of energy here because then we

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:90%
would have to--

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Have to go back
to the moon to get it.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:00.595 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:00.595 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: There's something--

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well,
there's a lot of money

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.758 align:middle line:84%
being made, I'm just saying,
with gas, coal, and oil,

00:22:04.758 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and this would eliminate a
lot of that right off the bat.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It would
change that, but that's

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:90%
all in the right direction.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Talk about
interventions,

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:28.606 align:middle line:84%
I think we had one for real, and
it was with probably Apollo 11.

00:22:28.606 --> 00:22:31.423 align:middle line:84%
You remember they said they
saw beings at the crater's rim?

00:22:31.423 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The crater, oh yes.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.965 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We're
not alone up here,

00:22:33.965 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and we have all that hearsay.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I think what happened, why
we don't go back to the moon,

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I think we got ran off.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:90%
You can look this up online.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:84%
How much debris and junk
did we leave on the moon?

00:22:54.470 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
400,000 pounds, 200 tons
of crap up on the moon.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.535 align:middle line:84%
We hadn't even got there,
and we were throwing--

00:23:04.535 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We were already
getting stuff ready.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Dumping
our trash there.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.208 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There's 96 bags
of feces laying up there.

00:23:11.208 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Astronauts had to go somewhere.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:84%
They ain't carrying
it back home.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:84%
They just threw all this
stuff out on the moon.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So what if somebody
did live there

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and they look up on the roof,
and we dropped 200 tons of crap

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:90%
literally?

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: On your backyard.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: All over your roof.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we're saying
over the radio message,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're going to move
to the moon and occupy it.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, we have to
because we've already dumped

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:90%
so much trash on top of Mt.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Everest and in the oceans here--

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.685 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, now we can
go trash the moon some more.

00:23:42.685 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We got to go find
somewhere else to trash.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.982 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So I think
the aliens probably got

00:23:45.982 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
a hold of Neil
and Buzz and said,

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
you guys can take some
pictures, walk around,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.115 align:middle line:84%
gather a few rocks, and
then get out of here.

00:23:53.115 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And don't bring your
nasty selves back.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.150 align:middle line:90%
You're a bunch of pigs.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at what you did to
the place, trashed it already.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I think we got ran off
because we littered so bad.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:84%
What I would propose is
going back to the moon.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
First thing we do,
the earth movers,

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:84%
talking about
picking up trash, we

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:84%
go back and pick all 200
tons of crap back up,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
bring it back home, give
it to Sotheby's, and let

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:90%
them auction it.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.440 align:middle line:84%
That'd pay for the
entire program--

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.242 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Done.

00:24:21.242 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --and make a
fortune at the same time.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They'll be making
washes out of that stuff

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:90%
overnight.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: People go, would people
pay for astronaut crap on--

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:90%
yeah, they would.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:90%
They would buy anything.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So then you go back and see if
you can make contact and tell

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
them, we're sorry about
running all over your property

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:90%
and not even asking you.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you know there's
an association that's

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.670 align:middle line:84%
formed to make sure that
the lunar landings are never

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:90%
disturbed or bothered?

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a
national association.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.148 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, I did know that.

00:24:52.148 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, look
it up on the internet.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And they want to make sure
that they preserve the sites.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Anybody in those
organizations ever

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:84%
thought the moon might
belong to somebody?

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Did you bother asking them?

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Now you're making a permanent
preservation site on their roof

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.940 align:middle line:90%
and didn't even ask?

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious about things
NASA don't want anybody

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to go look at, the big arch,
the cannon tower, whatever

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:90%
they came up with names on.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.793 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
those things are.

00:25:22.793 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Like crop circles, I
don't know what they are,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
but I know they're real.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Them crop circles
are real, y'all.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It ain't no Doug and Dave
show stomping out there

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
with a board and a rope.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
They're really
something going on.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:39.475 align:middle line:84%
Now it maybe something as simple
as teenagers from alien race

00:25:39.475 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that stole the family
car and come down

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:90%
here and do graffiti--

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --Extraterrestrial
graffiti.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Something like
that, but it's real.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not made up.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not done by us.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It's an intelligent
form of some kind

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
of entities trying
to communicate,

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:90%
but we're not getting it.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's a real thing.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Back to the moon, the
moon's real, it's there,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's not what
we think it is.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And I love it when all the
printed material will tell you

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:90%
that the moon is part of Earth.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, how come there was
such a vast difference

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in age in the soil samples
to Earth, 500,000 years?

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Now geologically,
that's nothing.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you put it on
real chronological time,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.085 align:middle line:84%
we only live about 80
years, half a million years

00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:90%
is significant.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.535 align:middle line:90%
The thing didn't come from us.

00:26:35.535 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you check with
the astrophysicists

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and look at their records,
they'll tell you about a time

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
when the moon showed up.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Showed up, like it came in.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they'll
tell you that it

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:55.900 align:middle line:84%
came in within 22,000
miles of Earth and stopped.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, you don't have to be a
rocket scientist or a scientist

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:84%
of any kind to know
something that much mass

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:84%
coming to something
with that much mass,

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to stop.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.840 align:middle line:90%
It's going to slowly plow in.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.170 align:middle line:90%
It's going to look god awful.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But it stopped and then started
moving an inch and a half

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:22.470 align:middle line:84%
away each year, so now it's
only 238,000 miles away.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:90%
So how close was it?

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
If you walked out
in your backyard

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:84%
when it showed up, from horizon
to horizon, left and right,

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
top and bottom would
be nothing but moon.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.285 align:middle line:90%
And so what's up with that?

00:27:38.285 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They won't seem to bring
that up and talk about it.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I call that a
very large intervention.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.990 align:middle line:90%
They came in and stopped.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing?

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But 22,000 miles is
an interesting number

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
because 22,300 miles is an
exact geostationary position

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:90%
that we put our satellites in.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And that thing
stopped right there.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:90%
They're very precise about it.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:90%
They will tell you 22,000 miles.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, hmm, there's
something up with that.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think the moon
has got a lot more mysteries.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What does that
mean, being a scientist

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:90%
and explaining that?

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I don't
know, other than, see,

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:84%
it's like universal
forces at work,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and you have universal laws.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:84%
That was a
geostationary position.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was the best point
that the moon could get to.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
None of it makes sense when
you really think about it.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:90%
And the moon didn't even rotate.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:90%
It's in a tidal lock.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.990 align:middle line:90%
That's weird.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
But the mass of
the moon compared

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to the mass of the
Earth, the moon's

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.430 align:middle line:84%
way too big for the
Earth to have captured.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:52.816 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I can go on
interventions out the yin yang

00:28:52.816 --> 00:28:55.066 align:middle line:84%
because we should have been
destroyed by our own moon,

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.146 align:middle line:90%
and we weren't.

00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:58.145 align:middle line:84%
And now the moon is
just so far away,

00:28:58.145 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:90%
and we won't go back to it.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
There's interventions up and
down the historic timeline.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.242 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.242 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know
who the somebody is.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I really would.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Why they don't make full
contact, I haven't a clue.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Maybe we're
just not ready yet.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I guess not.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I see a lot
of disclosure happening

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet, except for
the United States of America.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And there's a lot
of, for me, all those files

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that I've read from all
the countries, I mean,

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that's intervention,
a lot of that.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know if
we ever make contact

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:84%
with whoever's on the moon,
if they signed any earlier

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:90%
agreements.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you like to know
the names on that paper?

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think we did, but we
also kind of backstabbed them,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:84%
not meaning whoever signed
the paper, but probably

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:84%
other industrial
military complexes that

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.355 align:middle line:90%
got this amazing technology.

00:29:55.355 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, if
you doubt that,

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:90%
go ask the American Indians.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.043 align:middle line:84%
We made 200 treaties and broke
every single one of them.

00:30:02.043 --> 00:30:03.168 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There you have it.

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We're just
not good at treaties.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't be surprised if
we signed a treaty with whoever

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.120 align:middle line:90%
if we've broke that.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's where your disclosure
is going to come from,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
the third entity, the
people who we can't control.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.765 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.765 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
That'll be a fun day
when that happens.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about General LeMay's
intervention experiences.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.615 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: I was
working on Pitholem,

00:30:33.615 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:10%
and Pitholem was the
big rocket that I built.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So we're in our
operation, I'm in the lab,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm working, and there was
people coming and going

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.320 align:middle line:84%
This guy, he didn't even
come out of uniform.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.778 align:middle line:84%
Normally we would tell them to
show up in civilian clothes,

00:30:47.778 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:90%
but he's all decked out.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't help but notice
that the lights reflecting off

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:90%
all his medals and stuff.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But he was talking to
LeMay about something

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that had do with SAC,
Strategic Air Command,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and I overheard
him say to LeMay,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.150 align:middle line:84%
we don't need an incident
like we had at Vandenberg.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.895 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we lost
a whole wing that day,

00:31:12.895 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:90%
just sitting on the ground.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So he walked away, and
LeMay came over to me,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.005 align:middle line:84%
and this was the only time
I ever asked LeMay anything

00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
because I remembered him
chewing Goldwater out,

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.933 align:middle line:90%
Senator Barry Goldwater.

00:31:26.933 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big
powerful senator,

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just a 17-year-old kid.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But I just had to ask him,
did all those bombers blow up?

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Did you lose them?

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.820 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me, and just for
a moment, I guess he just--

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:84%
we'd been working together
almost two years now.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So he just said,
I had an incident.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I said, with what?

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:90%
UFOs.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And we never talked about UFOs.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.417 align:middle line:90%
That subject was just taboo.

00:32:02.417 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Off limits.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, don't
bring up anything.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, were UFOs
giving you a problem there

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:90%
with your bombers?

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, yeah, two of
them flew over Vandenberg,

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:20.363 align:middle line:84%
and I had 45 nuclear warheads,
and they all went dead cold.

00:32:20.363 --> 00:32:22.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you
understand the warheads?

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.032 align:middle line:84%
I said, the cyclotrons
wouldn't even cycle up.

00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:29.484 align:middle line:84%
I went, well, did they shoot
you or blow up somebody?

00:32:29.484 --> 00:32:31.192 align:middle line:84%
Nah, just flew over,
flashed their light,

00:32:31.192 --> 00:32:32.590 align:middle line:90%
and it was done, gone.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we find
that very disturbing.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.325 align:middle line:90%
I said, I bet you did.

00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I stared asking
another question.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:90%
He said, no more questions.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But he referred
to them as UFOs?

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, he
said balls of light.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Balls of light.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.105 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, that's
how he referred to them.

00:32:52.105 --> 00:32:54.540 align:middle line:90%
They came in and out real fast.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Didn't do any physical
damage, but he said,

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:90%
rendered my whole wing down.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said it took
two weeks before they

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:84%
could get the warhead
mechanisms come back

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.123 align:middle line:90%
to where they can be recharged.

00:33:08.123 --> 00:33:10.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, could you come up
with something that could

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:90%
do that, something like that?

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's a
technology, General,

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.180 align:middle line:90%
that's beyond our envelope.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.612 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the industry
for that kind of stuff.

00:33:21.612 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:84%
He didn't go any
further than that,

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and I knew better
than just to drop it.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's it right there.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.890 align:middle line:84%
That's all you're
going to get from him.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and then he
handed me a page with a list

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:90%
about as long as my arm.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Here, you got to get this done.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Get this done there.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.057 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and that was
the end of that talking,

00:33:34.057 --> 00:33:38.730 align:middle line:84%
but it made me
wonder about things

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:84%
because he was very
closed-lipped about all

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:90%
that stuff.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think we'll
continue to have intervention?

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.728 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I think we're going
to have interventions until we

00:33:47.728 --> 00:33:49.480 align:middle line:90%
have a full-fledged meeting.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Mainly
because we need help.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.250 align:middle line:84%
We're like the out
of control alcoholic.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:01.020 align:middle line:84%
You got to intervene to save
the poor soul because he's not

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.000 align:middle line:90%
going to save himself.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think they've just been
watchdogging us ever since.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.859 align:middle line:90%
That's another good question.

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:09.997 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea why.

00:34:09.997 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Probably
just to make sure we

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:84%
don't kill more than half the
planet or destroy the planet.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, one
thing that I know,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that other worlds
would not want somebody

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:84%
like us taking nuclear
power into space

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:84%
because nuclear weapons into
space does worry other planets.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Because we're a war-like
creature to begin with.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.639 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine us dragging
nukes out there with us?

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.189 align:middle line:90%
That's a scary thought to them.

00:34:40.189 --> 00:34:42.106 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, you
shouldn't be bringing nukes

00:34:42.106 --> 00:34:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to the playground with
all the communities--

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.989 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You're not
playing too well

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in the sandbox when you want to
just nuke the entire sandbox.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:90%
