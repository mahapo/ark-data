00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hey Jason.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON RICE: Thank
you, Jay, for having me.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we're
back on Mars now.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:10%
You've completed your training,
your four-month training.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:10%
You're probably quite
anxious to do something,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:10%
because two years of
training is an awful lot.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:10%
So what happened at that point?

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Well, the
mission of IDARF

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:10%
was to provide troops
resources, to provide

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:10%
defensive capabilities
to other planets that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:10%
were under either direct
current or imminent threat

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:10%
from an invasion by
an alien species.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we were real
excited about being

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
able to go and try
and help these people.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
My first deployment was to
be referred to as Area 26.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I was a platoon leader,
and my first mission

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
was to take my platoon
and move into this city

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and to gather intelligence
and information that we would

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
be later using to help them
form a defensive plan, come up

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with objectives for
resources they need to save

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and stockpile, and areas that we
could help them on for defense.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But our first mission was
to reconnoiter the city,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
find out what kind of social
arrangements they have,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
how the city's laid
out, how it's set up,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
what kind of technologies
they were using.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of information
that we just didn't have.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And so these were
the initial stages

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
before the planetary governments
went public with, hey,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
we've gotten help.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.696 align:middle line:84%
We're about to be
invaded, and these

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
are the guys that are
going to be helping us.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was everything
as you were told

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:90%
when you were deployed there?

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.194 align:middle line:90%
Or were there deceptions?

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, there
were deceptions.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Make no mistake about it.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
The deceptions that they
used for us, number one,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
is that the same group calling
the shots with the IDARF fleet

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
were the same groups that were
providing the alien invasions

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and that that was their means
to get their foot in the door

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
as they required a planetary
population to declare

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:90%
a single government.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
They required that
government to invite them in.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
They required that
government to allow

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
them to establish a financial
system, again, means

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.514 align:middle line:84%
of control, means
of manipulation.

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're
saying the people

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that were commanding
IDARF were also

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:90%
funding the alien invasion.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Draco,
that's correct.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The Cabal
also must've started

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
raising their own
armies just to make

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:84%
sure they had at least equal
amounts with the Germans,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they had
the fallback kill switch

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that they had as a last
resort, if they needed to.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't account for
the other 24,000 soldiers

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans did
provide themselves.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You mentioned
the kill switch.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, that has
to do with the failsafe

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that the Cabal built
into the 24,000 soldiers

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that they provided
to the Mars Germans.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It is a special code within a
particular nanite enhancement

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that provides suicide of the
soldier at the, basically,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:90%
push of a button.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And included in that are the
munitions that are hidden

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:90%
onboard the ships.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Now those work out to a distance
of about 500 light years,

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
so the ships may be
1,000 light years away.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But once they enter that zone
of within 500 light years

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
of Earth, then it
would be transmitted

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
through the ship's transmitters
or the retransmitters that

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:90%
are included with the units.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And would it dismantle
the weapons onboard or?

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It would cause
each of the soldiers

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
with that nanite
enhancement to die,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
as well as the explosion of
the anti-matter munitions

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:90%
that they've hidden.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We're going to get into
the suits and the technology

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:90%
in detail in a future program.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They're
absolutely amazing.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The abilities that soldiers
have from these suits--

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:90%
they're ballistic-resistant.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
They have servo controls and
electro motor controls built

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
into them for enhanced
strength-- jumping, running,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:84%
They're self-sustaining so
that you could be in the worst

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:90%
environment-- deadly, toxic--

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and still survive, up
to and including space

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that all the radiation,
the heat, cold, anything.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
They're absolutely
amazing suits.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.929 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, so Jason,
you went to a planet.

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know a little
more about this planet,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
like were there humanoids
that lived there?

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The inhabitants of
this planet were humans.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They were a little bit smaller
than the typical Earth humans,

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
average height being
about five feet, which

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:84%
is one of the reasons why
I was able to blend in.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not much
taller than that.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But their size was equivalent
to a healthy human.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It was just they were
a little bit smaller.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:90%
The flora and fauna--

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
they had a lot of trees
that resembled pine trees,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:90%
pine needles.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:90%
We called them near pines.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
They had forests that were full
of near oaks, rivers, streams.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a greater prevalence
of fresh water as opposed

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, which is covered
mostly by saltwater.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they have
different races?

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This planet
had different races.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
They were light-skinned,
dark-skinned.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The predominant race
were lighter-skinned,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of like an olive
Greek or Mediterranean.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And eye
color-- same thing?

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Different eye colors?

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Different eye colors,
different hair colors.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And what do they eat?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They ate
fruits, vegetables.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
They did not eat
livestock or meat.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They didn't.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were a heavy
seafood diet, if you will.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The first town that
I was deployed to

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
was right on a very, very
large lake, freshwater body.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was large enough that you
couldn't see the other side--

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many miles, probably
the size of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And do they
have an industry,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
or was it mostly
farms and agriculture?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, they
had mixed industry.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
They did not have a financial
monetary-based economy

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:90%
like we have here.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Their economy was
based on bartering

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:90%
for services and goods.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:84%
It was more of a clan
or a guild-based system

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:90%
that they used.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And so our first
mission was to find out

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
as much as we could
about the people

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that we were going
to be helping.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.721 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were they a warring
people or a gentle people or?

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were not warring.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they hadn't had wars
or fighting in centuries,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:90%
by the time we'd gotten there.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So this
alien invasion must

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.152 align:middle line:90%
have been shocking to them.

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:33.952 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:07:33.952 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:90%
It was very shocking to them.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
They were not prepared to
circle the wagons, so to speak.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.329 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Do they have weapons?

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, they did not.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.745 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They did
not have weapons,

00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:46.009 align:middle line:84%
so they were, really,
in some ways, bad shape.

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were in bad shape.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And we were set out
to, first, figure

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
out what kind of
civilization they had.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know if
they were guild-based.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know if
they had money.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So we had to first find
out, so we told them

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
we were from far enough away,
but we brought trading goods

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that were equivalent
to what they were

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.285 align:middle line:90%
using at the time for trading.

00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:90%
And we were wanting--

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
our goals, we told
them, was to set up

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
a trade mission of some
type to exchange goods

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:90%
from one city to another.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you learn
their language?

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I must have learned
it before we made planetfall

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
as part of the programming
that I received.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we have kind
of a gentle people living

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
on a planet somewhere,
and did the aliens invade

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:90%
before you guys arrived?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No we arrived
well enough in advance,

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.788 align:middle line:84%
so we thought, that we
would have time to prepare.

00:08:38.788 --> 00:08:40.329 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you had
intel that told you

00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:41.287 align:middle line:90%
the aliens were coming.

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Somebody had
intel that thought

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that they knew when the
aliens were going to arrive,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
when the invasion was going
to happen, roundabouts.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it was
within a month or two

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.614 align:middle line:84%
was the target
that they gave us.

00:08:53.614 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But you've also said
that the same group that

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
was behind the aliens
was the same group that

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.022 align:middle line:90%
was behind your forces.

00:08:59.022 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But you didn't
know that then.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Did not know
that at the time.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That was something
that came as a surprise.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There would've
massive revolts soon.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you arrived
on this planet,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.828 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing
you do is you're just

00:09:08.828 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
going to do intel,
gentle Intel to find out

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:90%
what the landscape is like.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Blend in.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Blend in.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Become
members of the city

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
for a period of
three to six months.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: OK, and no military or--

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No military.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Dress like they do.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And the aliens
are on their way.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.448 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They're on their way.

00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
We had planned on getting
there a year in advance,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.125 align:middle line:84%
so we would have time to blend
in, to find out, to scout,

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.752 align:middle line:84%
to gain information,
gain the trust.

00:09:34.752 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what would
be the ultimate end

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:90%
of this intel gathering?

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So that we could
tailor the defensive systems

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and the methods based on what
they had, the way that they

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
did things so that
we could blend it

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%
in as seamlessly as possible.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you guys
like these people?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You did.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.075 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We did.

00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:53.491 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah,
everybody liked them.

00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
all very likeable.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Their society was
based on very open.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't checkpoints.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
There weren't any
real heavy questions

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:90%
doubting where we'd come from.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
They were very trusting, a very
friendly, very open society.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.254 align:middle line:90%
People were helpful.

00:10:12.254 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Was there a culture--

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:90%
music, art?

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, yeah.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Art, culture, music.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
They had their own artwork that
they decorated the city with,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%
whether it was--

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have any
motorized vehicles.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
The cities were
generally small enough

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that 800,000 were about
the size of the city

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:90%
that we first went to.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And right at the edge of where
the city ended, it was forest.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they only expanded
as they needed to grow,

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and it was interesting to stand.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You could stand on the dividing
line between wild forest

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:90%
and urbanized area.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
There was not
really any suburbs.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84%
They built out as much as they
needed when they needed to.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The aliens
that later attacked--

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:90%
what were they like?

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The aliens
that later attacked--

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle line:84%
those were the
werewolf-like aliens.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what we had
termed them to be,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
as they were a cross between
an eight-foot tall hominid

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
with quadrupedal, two arms,
two legs, except they had

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:90%
hair and fur and larger ears.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:84%
They had a shortened
snout but lots of teeth.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine something
that's terrifyingly scary,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
that is what we were looking at.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is it possible
that somebody on Earth

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
got a hold of DNA
or something and was

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:90%
trying to make these creatures?

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, knowing that these
creatures were split into two

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:90%
classes--

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
they were the soldier class
and the commander class,

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and you couldn't
tell any difference

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:90%
between them physically.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It was just the level of
intelligence between the two.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.604 align:middle line:84%
The soldier class were a
lot like drones, directed

00:11:58.604 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and ordered, and then they would
go without stopping or thinking

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:90%
about their own safety.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And the commanders were the ones
that were calling the shots.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It's possible, since
they were a created

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:84%
being for the purposes
of invading this planet,

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that that same DNA
or that same pattern

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:90%
was brought and repeated here.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You specifically said
that these werewolf creatures

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:90%
were created.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.163 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What do you mean by that?

00:12:25.163 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, we
believed at the time,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and knowing now what
I know, that they were

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:84%
an artificial
creation of some sort,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have the
same type of biological makeup,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
once we got a chance
to examine them

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and Intelligence had a chance
to provide a report back to us,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:84%
because we were very
interested in finding out

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
the most efficient areas
to aim for, essentials.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So in finding out that there
were more mechanism-type parts

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and components than there were
tissue or organ-type parts.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Ah, so a combination
of machine and--

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Biological, yes.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why would
these creatures want

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:90%
to invade such a peaceful world?

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Don't have
the slightest idea.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.644 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what their
ultimate goal was, except

00:13:15.644 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that they were looking
to take over the planet

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and kill the inhabitants.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what we were told.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.141 align:middle line:84%
And that's, essentially, what
we saw from their actions.

00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what was the first
thing that happened in this war

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that really you knew now
this was going to be--

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: This was real.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.319 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah, this is it.

00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Something-- they must have
done a first invasion.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: There was.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:84%
The first realization that it
wasn't just a training exercise

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:84%
anymore was when I was at that
city that we had first gone to,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'd been there
a couple months.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Me and the rest of my platoon--

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
we'd spread out over the
city in different houses

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and taken up local jobs
to try and blend in,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:84%
working for some of the local
restaurants or shops or carts

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and moving things
and hauling things.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we'd started
integrating with the city

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to try and build up the
relationships with the locals.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And one day-- this happened
to be my day off- the city

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:84%
was well interspersed
with canals, everything

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
from a few feet wide to
a few hundred feet wide.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of their methods for
moving goods around the city

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
was by the canals,
because they were

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
able to put a lot
more on a barge

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and move it under
manpower than they

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:90%
were on a cart of some kind.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So the place where I was
taking my early evening meal

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:90%
was right next to a canal.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:84%
The beach was a couple of
blocks from where I was,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed, first
off, something was off,

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
because there were people
all going towards the beach

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and towards the bridge
crossing, the major canal

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
between the breakwater
and the mainland.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It was just something
out of the ordinary.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It definitely wasn't normal
for a group of people.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them, somebody
walking by, what was going on.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that something
was falling out of the sky.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, what?

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I was very curious,
and so I got up

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and started walking towards
the beach across the bridge,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
first sonic boom hit.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people that were
already on the bridge walking

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:90%
were shocked and stunned by it.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You'd see them duck
down or start to react.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I ran out to the observation
deck that is on the breakwater

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
structure, and I
ran towards an area,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
because I still didn't
have a clear view because

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:90%
of trees and buildings.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
clearing, I saw it.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.545 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What'd you see?

00:15:49.545 --> 00:15:54.074 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was some type of
meteor that was coming down.

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I was able to dial
in my enhanced vision

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
a little bit to get a better
picture of what it was.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
saw what was actually

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:90%
coming towards the lake.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Which was?

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was a
modified impactor that

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
had been fitted with a
very crude heat shield

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to prevent it from breaking
up, and it was on its way

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:84%
towards landing somewhere
out in the lake.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: A spaceship
disguised as a meteorite?

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, it was a
kinetic energy weapon.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And what they use is they will
take any large enough sized

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
rock that they
can find in space,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
fit a really crude
heat shield to it

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't break
apart, and then launch it

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:84%
towards the surface and the
areas that they want to try

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:90%
and strike.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Right, like using
a mass driver to push it.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Exactly.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a mass driver,
just a large piece of mass

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that builds up enough kinetic
energy that when it strikes,

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have the messy
side effect of radiation.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly has enough
fusion and explosion,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
concussion and
heat that it causes

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.695 align:middle line:90%
a tremendous amount of damage.

00:17:02.695 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you knew that this
was artificial, because you

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:90%
saw the heat shield.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Had you been briefed
earlier about this possibility?

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'd been briefed earlier
about this was one of their MOs

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
for opening salvos is
that they would soften up

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
the surface by launching
kinetic energy weapons.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And when this
thing hit, what happened?

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, before it hit,
I was in momentary shock,

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and then training took over.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I had communication with
the rest of my platoon,

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and so we had
already established

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:90%
protocols for quick signals.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Within a few characters,
we were able to transmit

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:90%
an entire message.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to send that
out to the rest of my platoon

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:84%
to let them know, hey, we've
got an impactor on the way

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and to follow our SOP plan
for what we were going to do,

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
which is get to high ground,
store and secure the equipment,

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:90%
and watch your six.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.062 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Watch your six?

00:18:05.062 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, watch your six.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What's that?

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Watch your back.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Watch your back.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.079 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: After I sent
the signal, there

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:84%
were a number of
people that were out

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:90%
on the observation deck.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I was concerned
with getting them off,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that if that
struck the water, which

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is what it looked like
it was going to do,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
we would be inundated with
a very, very large wave.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to try and get
as many people off as I could.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
talking to the crowd

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get them
back towards the mainland

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
without scaring
them into a panic.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to get a
large number of people

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
to start moving,
and then more people

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:90%
started going away as well.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And we were almost back
across the pedestrian bridge

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
when it struck and lit up
the entire sky behind me.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
It was enough that
I saw the light,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and then I knew that the wave
was going to be coming soon.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the impact was enough
to get the rest of the crowd

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:90%
and people running.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:84%
On my way back, one of the local
kids had started talking to me,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and I directed him to get back
across, get to the mainland,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
find high ground as
quick as you can.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that it
wouldn't be long

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.106 align:middle line:84%
before we got hit by the
wave, so I started running

00:19:27.106 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the crowd.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't, I would
have been run over.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I made it about a
block away from the canal,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and I turned and looked back
towards the breakwater in time

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:84%
to see most of the structures
there disappear from the wave.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like
watching buildings disappear.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the
concussion was so large

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that it was literally
destroying buildings.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It destroyed
the buildings out

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:90%
on the breakwater.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And it was
coming right for us.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I needed
to get someplace low--

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
a ditch, an alcove,
something so that-- or else

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I'd be killed with it.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I found an alley
and started running down

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
an alley, and along the back
of one of the buildings,

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and crouched in a corner
as quickly as I could

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
about the time that
the freight train

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
hit and started taking
out the building that

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:90%
was right above me.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.354 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The concussion wave.

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The concussion wave.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:29.822 align:middle line:84%
And I could see clearly from
there all the way to the coast.

00:20:29.822 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And I could see parts of
buildings in the canal,

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and I could see bloody, dusty
people moving around or getting

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.640 align:middle line:90%
up from underneath stuff.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And moments before
the streets were

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
filled with hundreds
of people, they

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:90%
were all gone, disappeared.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go check the
quarters that I was sharing

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
with a couple of other
members of my platoon

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.725 align:middle line:84%
and see if I could go ahead
and grab the emergency gear

00:20:55.725 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
or anything that was left in
case they didn't make it out

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
with it and to check and
see if any of my unit

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:90%
were still there.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I ran down, got into the
building that we were staying

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:84%
in, which is a couple of houses
down from the intersection,

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
found a first aid
kit in a backpack,

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and I started making
my way, running up

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:84%
towards the hill, which
was another block away

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:90%
when the waves hit.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, I was far
enough away from the coast

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:84%
that its energy had
been dissipated some,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
but it still made
it up to my chest

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
before I was able to get to
a point where I was safe.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You did get
to safety, though.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I did.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did they fire
any more of these weapons

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:90%
at this point?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, I found out later
they were aiming for the city.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with unguided
kinetic energy weapons

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.785 align:middle line:84%
is that even if you're
off half a degree,

00:21:51.785 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:84%
you can be off by
several hundred miles.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And this one missed
its target by 50 to 75 miles,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
thankfully, or else we'd
have been incinerated.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It would've
killed everybody.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Killed everybody.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.036 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What do the people of
this planet do at that point?

00:22:05.036 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, we had
to step up our plans

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
for organizing and arranging
and coordinating at that point.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Part of the operation
involved cleanup,

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and afterwards, I lost a few
members of my platoon that day.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And part of the company
commander's complaint--

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:90%
he was a Mars German--

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
was that he believed that there
was more that I could have done

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:84%
to save my soldiers
and also commented,

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:84%
since I cared so much about
those effing civilians,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that I could stay
without reinforcements

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and help clean up
in the aftermath.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I should have been worried more
about my platoon, which there

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:90%
was nothing I could have done.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And my platoon sergeant
reinforced that for me

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and said that if I had done
what the company commander had

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:84%
suggested that I wouldn't
have survived probably

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:90%
another month.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.817 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you got stuck on
this planet for a while.

00:23:02.817 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, I got
stuck doing cleanup work

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:84%
without reinforcements
as a punishment

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:90%
for helping the local civilians.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did any meteors hit
anywhere else on the planet,

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
or is this the
only one that hit--

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were
a series of them

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that went into different
places on the planet.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to attack.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the planet has
been hit all over the place.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You probably knew
more than the civilians

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We did.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:84%
We had more of a handle
on what was going on.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, general
public weren't aware

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
yet that they were facing
an impending invasion.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All right, so
then what happened?

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, part of their
MO we'd been briefed on

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:84%
was that they would also bombard
the poles with kinetic energy

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
weapons deliberately to
melt polar ice, which,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:84%
of course, raises
the sea level, which

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:84%
anybody with oceanfront property
ends up getting flooded.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, the city we were in
was on a lake and not part

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of the oceans, so ours
weren't as affected

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:84%
by that as some of
the other areas.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:84%
There were areas that were on
the ocean that ended up being

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:90%
under 20, 30 feet of water.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing parts
of the city that were--

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:90%
it's all under water.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:18.997 align:middle line:90%
And it's just eerie silence.

00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:19.796 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:24:19.796 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't find
people up on top

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:90%
of buildings that had survived.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
the water levels

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
hadn't risen to a point
where it wasn't receding yet,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and so after the attack,
there were large portions

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
of the city that were
left uninhabited,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
because the population
just wasn't there.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing that
we had to worry about

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.887 align:middle line:90%
was, what do we do for food?

00:24:42.887 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to help
the city organize and get

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:90%
themselves food and fed.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How long
did this war last?

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We were on
planet for 47 months.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.747 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow, almost four years.

00:24:52.747 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Almost four years.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we're going
to get into this war,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
but I want to go back to
something you said earlier

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:90%
that I think is important.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is you said
that you later found out

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
a faction was funding both
sides of this war-- your side

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and the werewolf's side.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Who was this?

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A Draco.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The Draco.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:90%
For what purpose?

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They eventually wanted
to gain control of that planet.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Resources?

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Resources, slaves.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so they were creating
a war that would be what?

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:90%
A diversion.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.170 align:middle line:84%
What was the point of
having a war, though?

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean why didn't the
werewolf creatures

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.716 align:middle line:90%
just invade and take over?

00:25:28.716 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, what
they wanted is

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to have a planet
that was mostly intact.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
They wanted a population that
was not able to fight back.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:84%
They needed to be invited
in, which was our part.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And they allowed us to
go and offer assistance.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And as part of the
conditions for that,

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
we required them to have a
single government, a one world

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
government so that it was easier
to coordinate and organize

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and arrange.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.887 align:middle line:90%
So as part of--

00:26:04.887 --> 00:26:06.095 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The Draco wanted this?

00:26:06.095 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The Draco wanted this.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Same thing with
the financial situation?

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to stop the
bartering and the guilds and--

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Set up that
method of control, yes.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The Babylonian
money system?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they're doing
this is because it's easier

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:90%
to control the population?

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's easier to control
those that are desperate,

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and when you've got in
a war that has mostly

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
destroyed a planet, you have a
people that become desperate.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They're desperate to survive
and to carry on and to live.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when you've got somebody
that's in that position,

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:84%
they would pretty much get
anything and everything

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:84%
they wanted, which was to turn
over control of the planet

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever they
needed them to do in order

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to help them to fight
off the invading force.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we have a
very peaceful planet.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Why did they want to
attack these people?

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, another one
of the MOs that I noticed

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
was that we never went
to any planets that

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:90%
had more advanced technology.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And they always
ended up sending us

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.820 align:middle line:84%
to planets that were industrial
age or less on the technology

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:90%
scale.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
that if they stood

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
a chance of being able to
repel the invasion themselves,

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:90%
then we weren't needed.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they are weak
by the nature of the fact

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:90%
that they hadn't advanced yet.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.578 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:27:36.578 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you thought that
your presence was benevolent?

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, we
thought we were there

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to help these people
defend their planet.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't think
of we were there

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
to enslave the planet for
somebody else's control.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
We were briefed and
told countless times

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that our purpose and our
mission was to go and help

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:84%
local populations defend their
planet from alien invasion.
