00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Today I'm with David Adair.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.037 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome.

00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me here.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:10%
>> So David, why did we
stop going to the moon,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:10%
and why did we really kind
of have a halt to this

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.375 align:middle line:10%
in the early '70s of
the space program?

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I wish I could give you
an answer that's as good

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:10%
as the question because
there's no logical answer.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:90%
None of it makes sense.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:84%
The official explanation
was unpopular.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.676 align:middle line:90%
You had 1968.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:90%
The Vietnam War was blazing hot.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:90%
It was really unpopular.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:90%
There was just poverty.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:84%
LBJ was trying to run the
great programs, welfare

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:90%
and food stamps.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:90%
All that stuff came about.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Hard times.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It was, and they were just--

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
but really, I can
pinpoint it better.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
It was NASA's fault
for not telling you

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:84%
what they were doing,
why they were doing it,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:90%
and how their money was spent.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:10%
If you would have had that
subdivision of NASA called

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:10%
Technology Transfer,
that division, really,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:10%
if they had advertised
that to the public,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:10%
the public would
have went, man, we're

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:10%
getting some good
returns on our money.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Your tax dollars earned more
money on technology transfer

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
than Wall Street
could ever touch.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:90%
But nobody talked about that.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.522 align:middle line:84%
It was treated as an
unwanted stepchild.

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does that mean, so
that the audience knows this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
first technology
transfer system.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
What does that actually--
what's the definition of that?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Example or the
best definition?

00:01:58.257 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the example.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> An example-- three astronauts
in a command module going

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:90%
to the moon.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It's no bigger than
a walk-in closet.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Very tight.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> They're eating, drinking, and
going to be out there for about

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:90%
eight or nine days.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Something's got to give, y'all.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:90%
And everything floats.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So you got a real
sanitation problem.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
They've got to do 1 and 2, and
it's going to float with you.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:90%
That's not a good deal.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So we had to make
this material that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
would absorb nastiness stuff and
they could change out diapers.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We looked at that in
the transfer division,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
called Johnson & Johnson, and
you get the disposable diaper.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
That's where it came from.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
The material in your
disposable diaper

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
is what the astronauts
wore to the moon and back.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:90%
That's technology transfer.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:90%
And everybody thought, wow.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was just Tang.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
That stuff tasted
awful, by the way.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:90%
God almighty.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:90%
But that's technology transfer.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, in seriousness of
the technology transfer,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I know of at least
35,000 transfers

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:90%
that's made it into your life.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Such as?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Crash barriers that you
see, that your car runs into.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
You go, oh, how did that
come from the space program?

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, here comes a command
module in at 5,000 miles

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.655 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:29.863 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to slow down
because if it don't, that's

00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:84%
a rough landing, even
in water at 5,000.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So the big parachutes open
up, big as a football field,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
slow it down from
5,000 to about 12.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, you better have a
heck of a shock absorber

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.400 align:middle line:84%
between the parachutes and
the capsule or the astronauts

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
are going out through the
bottom of the capsule.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:90%
They don't like that.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So the shock absorbers
transferred into these barriers

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the ones with
the big yellow barrels.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the ones that
have all the cables.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
You can hit that thing
at 80 miles an hour,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.515 align:middle line:84%
and you and your family
are going to walk away.

00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And another-- when we had the
astronauts in the Mercury days

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
flying up there, astronauts are
looking at going up in space,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
doctor's sitting on
the ground, looking up.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.698 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if that astronaut's OK?

00:04:15.698 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to do
something about that.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So they put the leads on the
astronauts, sent vital stuff

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
back to the doctors like
blood pressure, pulse

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:90%
rate, respiratory functions--

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>> --and all that.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And they could then, oh,
the astronaut's doing fine.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Technology transfer comes in.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
We look at that, put
it in two suitcases.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
First responders
get to an accident

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.882 align:middle line:90%
out here on the highway.

00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They open up the cases, hook
the leads to the person,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
the information goes
back to the hospital.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:90%
All the vitals are there.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
They tell the first responders
how to stabilize the person

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and get him to the hospital.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
this stuff came from?

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Came from the space program.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And the computers.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I could go for hours
because there's

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
so much in computer
technology we

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
had to learn just to calculate
our way to the moon and back.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I started doing research working
as a space industrial transfer

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:90%
consultant.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And in that world, I got
to see a lot of cool stuff

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that the industrial applications
were being used in space.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the challenges
that especially the Soviet

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Union's really leaning
on was the melting

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
of metal in a
weightless environment.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I saw
what looked familiar back

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
at Groom Lake, and went, that's
how they made this thing.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.032 align:middle line:90%
They must've cast this thing--

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> In vacuumless space.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --in the vacuum
weightlessness of space.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't till
more research,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and I finally got
the idea how do

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:84%
you shape metal in a
weightless environment.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:90%
The Soviets are looking at it.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
America and NASA
is looking at it.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like shoveling
smoke or trying

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:90%
to hammer jello to the wall.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a little hard, y'all.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But an accident happened
up there back in Skylab

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.555 align:middle line:84%
when one of the astronauts
listened to some music

00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and the sound waves started
pushing the metal everywhere.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Bam.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the
aha moment for me.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started down the path of
doing mathematical equations

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.480 align:middle line:90%
in geometric forms.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
For every shape in a geometric
universe-- a triangle, a cone,

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:90%
trapezoid, rectangle--

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
it has a distinct sound
that goes with it.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So by composing music, you
could shape with sound waves

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:90%
the object of what you wanted.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Any--

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Turned out--

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything you want.

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> --once I got started, the
control tolerance was really

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:90%
cool.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you-- yeah, that's
something we could get into.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.765 align:middle line:84%
>> The control tolerance of
standing vibrating waves,

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
when you get them to interlock
in a 90-degree corner,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:90%
people go, oh, yeah.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Try it sometime.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They have to understand--
and correct me

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
if I'm wrong-- you
have to make something

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
in the vacuum of time and
space through my experience.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:84%
There's so many-- you have to
think of a sphere like a sea

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:84%
urchin of all these different
angles of frequencies coming

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's on a molecular--

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:90%
we're talking very small nano--

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, man.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This is beyond anything,
because you're rearranging

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
atoms into something that the
program will allow you to do,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the way I got around
that was at a grocery store

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:90%
line, of all things.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And the clerk is standing
there with the barcoder,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
this poor, mindless
zombie going at it.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I was watching it,
and when I saw the way

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.205 align:middle line:84%
the light beams would
wrap around a product

00:07:48.205 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
so it gets the UPC code, and
then snatches it and clicks,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's done, I went, oh,
god, that's what I need!

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So what you would do,
you'd take something

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
that you would scan
with a barcode reader,

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
or actually just a laser light
that would wrap around it.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You get the mathematical
computations off of that,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
transfer it into
a computer that I

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
built that allowed
me to roll over

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical computations
into corresponding sound waves.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do is, when
you have your molten metal

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in a weightless
environment, like--

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:90%
we used a thing called GAS.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.716 align:middle line:90%
G-A-S. Getaway Special.

00:08:32.716 --> 00:08:33.516 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLES]

00:08:33.516 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:90%
It sounds funny.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this up.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:90%
That was a real program.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Look it up.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
For $3,000, $7,000,
or $10,000, you

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
could rent the space of
a 55-gallon drum that's

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
bolted on the inside wall
of the space shuttle.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Send it up.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And they ran thousands of
these programs in experiments.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And the astronauts would do two
things for you and that's it.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:90%
They would flip a switch on.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And then at a certain time
they flip the switch off.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So you had to make
everything robotic.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So after I got everything
in the canister,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
in the gas can the way I
wanted it, it melted metal.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was when
we played the computation

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
equivalence of the shape,
and from the reading

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:84%
of the barcode, the thing
became an absolute twin

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:90%
of what you just copied.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:90%
But the tolerance was so cool.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I could control one ten
thousandths of an inch.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That's impossible in casting
in the gravity field of today.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the molecular
structure of the metal.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
really gets good.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And what metal were you
experimenting with up there?

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> There were some compounds
and alloys I was using.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I won't give out for
proprietary reasons.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> But these alloys, you could
manipulate them with the sound

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.520 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:90%
So what happens, the metal--

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
if you could see
inside metal today,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
anything that's
metal that we got,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
on a subatomic level, the
molecular structure when

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
the molecules in the atoms
line up, it's just chaos.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Because the gravity convection
fields of the planet,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:84%
as the metal's
hardening, or casting it,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is just interfering with
all the molecular bonding.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So in space, you don't
have that problem.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:90%
The field's not there.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So you could set a
molecular structure the way

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
you want it to look and stay
in place until it's solidified,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:90%
hardened.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.747 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the brightest
bulb in the box,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
so I thought what structure
would I want to use?

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mother Nature's got
the best one we've ever seen.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:90%
It's called honeycomb.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I made a honeycomb
molecular bond of the metal.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And boy, that metal, when it
came back under shear load--

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:84%
it was no thicker than my
fingernail, my thumbnail,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
but on a shear load,
that thing had a thousand

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:90%
times the strength of titanium.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It weighed less than
Styrofoam of the same size.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Crystal clear.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:90%
TransSteel of the 22nd century.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like the national
will for a space program

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.345 align:middle line:90%
was just gone.

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even want
to talk about it.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Wanted to do away with it.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.075 align:middle line:84%
Which, here comes
all the conspiracy

00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
theories, alternate space
programs, all this stuff.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, was there an
alternate space program?

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:90%
I never ran into one.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.878 align:middle line:90%
I never saw any of the ships.

00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they were
still receiving money,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:90%
but we weren't going anywhere.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's, for me, a problem
for the American people paying

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:90%
all those taxes.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you've got to
remember the poor taxpayer.

00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:84%
They're putting
out a lot of money,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're not really getting
a lot back that they know of.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Or a lot of fluff
that amounts to nothing.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> But actually, you guys
were doing really well.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But NASA wouldn't promote
the industrial side of it.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, they even
told the big aerospace giants

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:84%
like Rockwell National, who
was the Detroit of the space

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:84%
shuttle, told them
that they were

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:90%
over-industrializing space.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Which, even today,
when they first

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:90%
said that to us back in the--

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:90%
like 1970, '70, '71.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You're
over-industrializing space.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Went, name of god, that's
what we're here to do.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't want it.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Something else is
going on somewhere.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll grant you that.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't go with
alternative space programs,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.282 align:middle line:84%
and Star Trek, and these
people coming and going, and--

00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:90%
what do they call them?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.475 align:middle line:90%
Off-world technologies.

00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know
anything about that.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I've never been on an
off-world colony anywhere.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Sure would like to go.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody come and get me,
and show me what you got.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen any
proof of any of that.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:84%
All I know is I just seen the
most stupid decisions made

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.215 align:middle line:84%
on the official part of
NASA and the government,

00:13:07.215 --> 00:13:11.412 align:middle line:90%
and it just stopped everything.

00:13:11.412 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I get annoyed with
people when they

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
tell me this will be the
50th anniversary of going

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:90%
to the moon.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:90%
That don't mean squat, dude.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know
nothing about the moon.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
You think we've
already been there.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Let me paint the
circumstances for you.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Did we go forwards or backwards
in our space exploration?

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> They stopped it.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we were
going and everything halted.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Just stopped.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Around the year you know.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
why did that happen?

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Why did we stop?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Because at least-- how are we
going to break through that?

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
After we had all these accidents
in space that were public.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You know that
the average public--

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean average-- they know
nothing about the space

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.290 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It don't even
enter their head.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I try
to tell everyone.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> They got their bucket of
chicken, and their hot wings,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and their Schlitz malt liquor,
and NFL on TV, and that's it.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:90%
None of this has entered their--

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't nothing to do
with the NASA that you see.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I ask the
question did we go forwards

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
or backwards, they
go, I don't know.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me paint
it out for you.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, I could hurl three
men and 450 tons of equipment

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
a half million miles to the
moon and back, round trip.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Today, I can't even get off the
planet to get low Earth orbit.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I have no way of
going to the moon.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Can't even take myself there,
much less any equipment.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:90%
So we've went backwards.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:90%
We shut down.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And around 1970,
'72, we were poised

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to really move on to
the moon, and then

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:90%
it just stopped and shut down.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's been shutting
down ever since.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
The pads that the space
shuttles launch from--

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.062 align:middle line:90%
pad 39 A and B--

00:15:05.062 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Google them and look at them.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Very familiar with this.

00:15:07.245 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just concrete slabs.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It's nothing.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> They took the launch gantries
and cut them to pieces and sold

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:90%
them for scrap iron.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a clear message.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:90%
You ain't going nowhere.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did they do that?

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think they
disassembled the program?

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.204 align:middle line:90%
What's your opinion on that?

00:15:21.204 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:22.883 align:middle line:90%
>> I just saved you.

00:15:22.883 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you did.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:90%
My opinion.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.986 align:middle line:90%
It's-- it's--

00:15:28.986 --> 00:15:30.414 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:30.414 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It's, in a connected
way, lunacy.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:90%
None of this is making sense.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:10%
You have a $150
billion space platform

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:10%
called the ISS,
which, by the way,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:10%
is not worth the effort
that we've been carrying on.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:10%
It's just a big erector set.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.563 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, it's going
around the Earth.

00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
you can get to it

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
now is you have to hitch
a ride on a Soviet rocket.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the
mood that Putin is in--

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and the last time NASA said
something he was mad at them

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and he told them next time
you want to get to the ISS,

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:90%
use a trampoline.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Which I thought was so cool.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But we took our shuttle
fleet, our fleet

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of vehicles that
get there and back,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and we put them in the museums.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
With 66% of their life
left on the vehicles.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So you, the poor taxpayer,
you bought a car,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and you drove that
thing for about 28%,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you threw
it in the junkyard.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You got no way to
get to the ISS.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
No backups in the wings
waiting to happen.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.167 align:middle line:84%
And you tell me that the private
sector is going to do it.

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you something
about the private sector space

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I've dealt with it
about four decades,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:90%
so I know a little bit about it.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:84%
First of all, that private
sector space program

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:90%
has been sitting on its butt.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
It's been letting you, the
taxpayers, fund everything.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You now expect them to
pull out their checkbooks

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and start writing in where
you, the poor taxpayers,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:84%
have been paying for
all this and it ends?

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see some
of these examples

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:18.089 align:middle line:84%
of rockets flying up and coming
back and landing and stuff.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's nothing compared
to what you should be doing.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's only a fraction
of what you really need.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are they today?

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Where is NASA today?

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And where is our space
program going in relation to,

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.794 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the other countries,
the other G8 countries?

00:17:36.794 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Boy, that's a
loaded question.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:10%
Right now, NASA has going JPL.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:10%
That's about it.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:10%
Jet Propulsion Lab.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:10%
They're sending out robots
to explore outer planets

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.390 align:middle line:10%
and inner planets.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And when, as
a civilian group,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
are we able to jump on board
with that and it be open

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:90%
to the public that--

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you really have
to work at it where you get

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:90%
on the sites.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Even then, you get
spoon-fed information.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:90%
They're not with us at all.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want
to get across.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we're not
doing this together.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:15.706 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.215 align:middle line:84%
Why won't they allow
the public to come in?

00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of the technology
they don't want to share?

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.645 align:middle line:90%
>> You know--

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I crashed a
policy meeting once.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:90%
I paid the price for it, though.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Got beat up by it.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Dave.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:90%
You bad boy, you.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I tell you.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:90%
It was at Cape Canaveral.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:46.883 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
like 1985 or 1982.

00:18:46.883 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they were
having a policy meeting.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.508 align:middle line:84%
I looked down at the
badges on the table.

00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I knew this one doctor
was in a different part

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
of the world doing
some research,

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.430 align:middle line:84%
so I grabbed his badge and
put it on and walked in.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And if I had stayed
quiet, it'd been OK.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't stay quiet.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The stuff they were saying
in this policy meeting

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:90%
started off with--

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
the shuttle program
was just starting up.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And the opening
statement of the chairman

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:84%
of the policy
committee of NASA said

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.037 align:middle line:84%
we don't want this silliness
of romancing of the moon

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:84%
like we had with the
Apollo days to be

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
involved with the shuttles.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting there going--

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:90%
I had to raise my hand.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, excuse me,
that silly romancing

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
provided the budgets which paid
all our checks so we could go

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.615 align:middle line:90%
do this stuff.

00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And they all looked at
me, and then they went on.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So then they made
another statement.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was along the lines of
the public is an intrusion.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And I raised my hand
and went intrusion?

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.398 align:middle line:90%
We're working for them.

00:20:00.398 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:90%
They're paying for this--

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-oh.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> --so we can
explore it together.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:90%
That did it.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:84%
The guy next to me leaned
over and looked at my badge.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.030 align:middle line:90%
You're not Dr. Heimick!

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, I'm not.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Man, they throw me
out of that meeting.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I land face-first out
in the parking lot.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Then they send deputy
sheriffs over to the restaurant

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
where I was, and they pulled me
out and started beating me up.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was saved by,
ironically, laborers

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
from a construction
crew that knew me.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And they come out there with
all their big pipe wrenches.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my goodness!

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And the two cops backed
off and got in their cruisers

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:90%
and said--

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.578 align:middle line:84%
even the cops didn't
want to beat on me.

00:20:36.578 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They just said we were told to
come over here and harass you.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the way NASA is.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.510 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to share anything.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, damn!

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:90%
We're funding them!

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.330 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you don't
want to share anything?

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Like they're elitist.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.200 align:middle line:84%
They have been riding
on the coattails

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
of those steely-eyed
rocket men from the '50s.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Been riding on
them for decades.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.775 align:middle line:84%
You don't have leadership
in the space program.

00:21:04.775 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
The last person that anybody
could tell me anything about

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
was some German named
Wernher von Braun.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:10%
Or they might remember
a name, Chris Kraft.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.470 align:middle line:10%
And they wasn't
sure whether he was

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:10%
the director of Johnson
Spacecraft Center

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:10%
or he built boats.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, god.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> My goodness.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a nutshell,
David, as a civilization,

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:90%
where are we going?

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
To wrap this up here
amongst the stars.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, right now
on an official level,

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
there's just no party
we're invited to.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:90%
We're not going anywhere.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.915 align:middle line:84%
They made that clear by
cutting up the pads 39

00:21:41.915 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
A and B. They've ended
the manned space program.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:84%
They're OK with little
robots and satellites,

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want men
out there for some reason.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's driving
something for some reason.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, are you representing
all of the major G8 countries?

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.695 align:middle line:84%
Or are you saying it was
mostly United States--

00:22:02.695 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It was mostly the United
States and NASA that's trying

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:90%
to control everything.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:84%
That control is slipping
out of their hands because--

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:84%
back to the guys with the hot
wings and the malt liquor.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Listen up, dudes.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just NASA that's
got a space program.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You now have your
European Space Agency.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:90%
About 20 countries in that.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
You've got CSA,
China Space Academy.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%
You got the Soviet Union.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You now have the Middle East
space program coming up.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
You even got the African
Union's space program.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know that one, did you?

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:90%
And there's more coming.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They are forming up
all around the planet.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Everybody but America.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the mining
of Mars and the moon?

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to be able to get
up there and take some of this?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we can use AI and
other rovers and stuff to do

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, see, that's just it.

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be hard to get
away from AI in the future.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be so integrated
into the fabric of society.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And they already started
on the commercial parts.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
You watch TV now, they're
talking about AI in your life.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And it can help historians
understand better history

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're making it
more benign-looking.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's coming out.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.472 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.472 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the key I
think they're missing,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is it's the speed at which
all this is going to move.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.092 align:middle line:84%
When the AIs get to a level
where they can be self-aware,

00:23:37.092 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:84%
man, you're going to see
a jump like you're not

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:90%
going to believe.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we survive this, then
within a single generation,

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
we could jump from
this world we're

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:90%
in now back to George Jetson.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you see them maybe making a
catastrophe to bring this out,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
or creating something, a
catastrophe on the planet

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that they would be
forced to utilize this?

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen a lot
of different information

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
on projects which led me
to believe that there's

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of other
agendas to release,

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
like you said, this
type of technology.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be at the right
time because of a chaotic event

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:90%
or an emergency situation.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I think--

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we have to create
a disaster, or fake a war,

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.523 align:middle line:90%
or a fake attack or whatever.

00:24:29.523 --> 00:24:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
do it on its own anyhow.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> On its own, right.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>> If anything, it's inevitable.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.202 align:middle line:90%
It's not if, it's when.

00:24:39.202 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
when part has got

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:84%
them really concerned because
they know it's coming soon.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Circumstances will
push us into an area

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
where we'll be forced to use
stuff like this, like AIs,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:90%
to get out of our problems.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to be faced
with another question--

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
is the AIs going to
want to cooperate?

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
invite us along

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
on the ride, or they
just going to ditch us?

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Are we on the train
with them or not?

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And are we going to be able
to go amongst the stars with

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't know.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> And how?

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.185 align:middle line:90%
And when?

00:25:15.185 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the questions,
of course, we get a lot.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, think
about it, y'all.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
They tell us in the
last 15, 20 years,

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
our technology equals all the
technology of the last 5,000

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:90%
years combined.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:90%
How did we jump so far so quick?

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:90%
We cheated.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:90%
We saw the answers to the test.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We saw somebody else's devices.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
were jumping so much.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you noticed,
this has slowed down.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think
we're getting--

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:90%
it's an infrastructure problem.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:90%
I knew that would--

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.000 align:middle line:84%
if you're cheating like that,
you're going to run into that.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I built
a Lamborghini car.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Very powerful, very
powerful engine.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Runs really fast.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's 1860.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no oil refineries.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no gasoline.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.352 align:middle line:84%
There's no fuel for
the Lamborghini.

00:26:14.352 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So we tie some horses to
it and pull it around.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It makes a cool-looking cart.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
infrastructure for it.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happening
with technology today.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like building up,
but it's come to a stop.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It needs infrastructure
for it to expand.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not getting it.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that the major next
jump that it's going to have,

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.712 align:middle line:84%
the AIs are going
to be involved.

00:26:39.712 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Your artificial intelligence.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But buddy, that AI comes
with a double-edged sword.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.598 align:middle line:90%
>> It sure does.

00:26:46.598 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to to be
careful of that technology

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's one technology
that can outgrow you real fast.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>> If you get it started,
and it becomes self-aware--

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It'll make the correct
decision sometimes.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and the first
thing it's going to do

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:90%
it's two-dimensional.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:84%
It's in a monitor
looking at you.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:10.488 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing it's
going to decide is, hey,

00:27:10.488 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:90%
you're three-dimensional.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I need a bipedalled,
anthropoid body

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
so I can move around in
your three-dimensional world

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:90%
so I can interact with you.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, that all sounds
nice and simple.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So they've started
building their own units.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:90%
And they got their own factory.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't need us.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:90%
It's the speed at that point.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know which
way it's going to go.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my question is
it Data or Terminator?

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't know.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Only AIs will know.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:90%
They'll make that decision.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But people said, well, they'll
be inadequate because they

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:90%
can't master emotions.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell you what's
happening already in that area.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:10%
Is that now entities
like Sophia--

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:10%
the artificial
intelligent woman that's

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:10%
on the internet, YouTube--

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:10%
they got her hooked
into the cloud.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that a big problem?

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Think about what you're
doing here, y'all.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
She'll eventually
master one emotion.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.480 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to learn.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as she
learns that, and you've

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
got thousands or millions
of AIs across the planet,

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.920 align:middle line:84%
they're all hooked
into the cloud,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and at the speed
of light, they're

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
all going to know just as
fast as when she knows it.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
just one learning it.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:90%
You got millions learning it.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, they've
already got the full range,

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and now they're at
that decision point--

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Data or Terminator.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you control an entity
that is now self-aware,

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.250 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have an IQ in the
hundreds, or thousands--

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:90%
in the millions!

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.738 align:middle line:84%
>> But makes judgment calls,
too, off of everything--

00:28:53.738 --> 00:28:54.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely!

00:28:54.538 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:84%
--it reads on the cloud,
which is everyone.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Many different
views and opinions.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And the speed at
which they can process,

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.995 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be on you
faster than you realized.

00:29:04.995 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I've caught criticism
over the years.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I was worried about
this stuff 30 years ago.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking
about AIs and what

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:90%
they're getting ready to do.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So I caught a lot of
criticism because I

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.305 align:middle line:90%
won't publish white papers.

00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
oh, you're a fake.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.480 align:middle line:90%
You're a fraud.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.283 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:29:29.283 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And they go because
you don't have

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:90%
any white papers, no research.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're right.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.515 align:middle line:90%
It's not because I didn't do it.

00:29:36.515 --> 00:29:37.315 align:middle line:90%
>> It's classified.

00:29:37.315 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I did do it.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not printing it because
guess what the AIs are going

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.720 align:middle line:90%
to do in the very first round?

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.970 align:middle line:84%
They're going to pull
all the white papers.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
All the patents.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Instantly.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Process it.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> They want to
see what we know.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And then start looking
for weak points,

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:90%
and find your Achilles heel.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:84%
They'll come up on David
Adair, and they get a blank.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well, did he do
this stuff or he didn't do it?

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:90%
He's an unknown.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to deal
with him because there's

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:90%
nothing on him.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.725 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you get
around a million IQ.

00:30:11.725 --> 00:30:14.100 align:middle line:84%
They can't do anything to you
if they don't know anything

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:90%
about you.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thanks, Dave,
for coming on the show.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate having you.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:84%
