>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:10%
we're with Ricardo GonzÃ¡lez,
author and researcher from Peru

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle line:10%
who has experienced multiple
direct contacts with

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:10%
an extraterrestrial species
called the Apunians.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking
about wars of the gods.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.478 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo,
ancient cultures

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
worldwide describe various
types of stories of gods at war.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, is this merely mythology
or folklore, or is there

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.227 align:middle line:90%
something more to it?

00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Of course
there are many stories

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that bring together the
worlds' folklore and myths

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
about the wars of the gods.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But not everything from the past
is myth, tale, or symbolism.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
After traveling to different
parts of the world,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that there's
a secret behind these myths.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I carried out this research
with the suggestions

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial beings
who are in contact with me.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
In their messages,
these beings were

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
very insistent in telling
me, it is important

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:90%
that you understand your past.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:10%
Everything that has happened
throughout human history,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:10%
from the beginning of
recorded history, where beings

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:10%
from other worlds,
following their own agendas,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:10%
having confrontations or
disputes among themselves,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:10%
and human beings in the
middle of that chess game.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is more to it
than just myths and legends

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
about the wars of the gods.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:90%
The question is, why the war?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Why did those so-called
gods clash with each other?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we see any
evidence of these wars depicted

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:90%
in ancient or religious texts?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: The first time I
heard about this war of beings

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
from heaven was through the
Peruvian shamanic traditions

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned before.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
But later, I discovered these
same accounts in the Bible

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:84%
As you know, in Latin
America, the Catholic religion

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:90%
is very predominant.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a
Catholic high school,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
where we would read the
Bible and find accounts

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:90%
of angels in chariots of fire.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I wondered
if these angels

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
could be something else--

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and their different functions
and roles in the Bible

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
accounts.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But this was just
the beginning because

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
contact, I started

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
researching other
cultures around the world,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:90%
like Sumer, Egypt, or India.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what struck me the
most were the ancient texts

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in India, where the gods seemed
to clash in flying vehicles.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I could mention an ancient
text, such as the Ramayana, that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
speaks of the vimanas, flying
vehicles used by the gods,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and other very interesting
stories in another text

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:90%
called, Mahabharat.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Mahabharat means, not by
chance, The Great War.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So I wondered, why in so
many parts of the world,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and so many ancient
cultures, there's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
talk of gods who use
vehicles to move about, who

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:90%
clash with each other.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, human
beings are in the middle

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of that conflagration, with very
complex and shocking accounts

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
where a faction or
segment of those gods

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
presented themselves as the
creators of human beings,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:90%
or as our parents.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And others viewed
us with skepticism.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And if they could thwart
our progress, they would.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I asked the beings who were
in communication with me

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
about all this, in order
to help me understand what

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I was finding in my research.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And they confirmed
that this had been

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
the case, that different groups
of extraterrestrial origin

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
were involved in our
reality a long time ago.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:84%
They tried to foster the
rise of our civilization,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
so that through
human civilization,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:90%
they could also learn.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why they tried to sow
knowledge, culture, to see what

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
would happen to their children,
their descendants, who

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
would be us.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But the very close
presence of these beings

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
generated dependencies, a very
dangerous bond of dependence

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
between humans and these,
quote unquote, "gods."

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, apparently, there were
power struggles, as I said,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
among these beings
from other worlds

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
who believed in us,
who saw our potential

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to develop into a new
civilization of hope

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
for the universe, after having
overcome so many problems

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, the other
position that said,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
no, human beings are
potentially dangerous.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And even, at a future
time, they could threaten

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:90%
the hegemony of the universe.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, just by
examining the accounts

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt and Sumer, we find
that duality of the gods.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:10%
In the case of Sumer, we find
it with the sibling gods,

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:10%
Enlil and Enki, and in
the case of ancient Egypt,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:10%
the case of the other
brothers, Osiris and Set, who

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:10%
represented, in some
way, a great battle

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:10%
that occurred in Orion.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
This information about the
Great War in Orion, which

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:90%
sounds like science fiction--

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I must clarify that
this is not described

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient texts of Egypt.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
This is information that comes
from our contact experience,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
which I know has resonated a lot
because quite a few people are

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
talking about this now.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But this comes
from a message that

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
was received from extraordinary
experiences lived in Latin

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:90%
America with these beings.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
What is absolutely true
is that Osiris represents,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:84%
for the ancient Egyptian
culture, Orion, and also

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
a very curious fact, that the
three pyramids of the Giza

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Plateau, like some
research, like

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:90%
that done by Robert Bauval--

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and those three pyramids
that amaze us on that Plateau

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.670 align:middle line:84%
are actually pointing
to Orion's belt.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
The unsettling part, Emery,
as you will remember,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
of this research that turned
the world upside down, which

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
is a topic of debate in
conventional archaeology,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:84%
is that the pyramids were
aligned with those stars

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:90%
about 12,000 years ago.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
That is an impossible
timeline because the pyramids

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
were built much later, around
2,600 years before Christ.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they were built
in the era indicated

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:90%
by our conventional history.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted to point out a
date, about 12,000 years ago,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:90%
marking the stars in Orion.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
What does this have to do with
the conflagration of the gods?

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
According to the information
and our contact experience,

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
the last Great War
broke out in Orion.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was 10,500
years before Christ.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
That is on the same date
as the pyramids would

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:84%
be pointing to Orion's
belt. And seeing

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
the similarities between
the gods of Egypt

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and those of Sumer, and
other accounts and myths

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient world,
I think there's

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
something we have
not yet understood,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:90%
beyond the haze of history.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, you mentioned
the Bible, the Vedas, Egypt.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Do we know who these beings are?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Well, I could
mention many other sources.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I just used a few
classic examples

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:84%
so that the audience could
understand and research.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But trying to understand
who would have been involved

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
in these events, beings
of cosmic origin,

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:84%
here we would be entering
into a more complex scenario

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
because not everything
has to do with Orion.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions also
speak of the Pleiades stars,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
where beings from other
worlds acted erroneously

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:90%
in our history.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:10%
You will remember in an old
interview that we had together,

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:10%
Emery, when we
discussed the mysteries

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:10%
of Mount Hermon in
Israel, according

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:10%
to the ancient book
of Enoch, 200 beings

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:10%
from heaven, angels
or extraterrestrials,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:10%
however you want to interpret
it, descended on that mountain.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
They broke from their
roles as guardians

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:90%
who had to protect us.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And they coupled sexually
with the women of the Earth,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
producing a race of
Giants that would later

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
go to war with humans--

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
thus, this in that
interview with you.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, these angels
who descended were

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:90%
nothing more than cosmonauts.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
They were associated
with the Pleiades stars.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So it is very
difficult to pin down

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the origin of beings
from other worlds acting

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:90%
in a hostile way in our reality.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I would add another concept for
the people who are watching us

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
because often when
talking about contact

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
civilizations,

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:84%
people want to label each
of these civilizations.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
This happens in many new
age circles in particular,

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
where they say,
the beings of Orion

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:90%
have these characteristics.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Those from Pleiades have these
characteristics, and so on,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
with different sectors
of the universe.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:90%
But that's ridiculous.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
the case of Orion,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
a constellation,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
a grouping of stars under a
preconceived order of hours.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But these stars
are separated from

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
each other by several
light-years distance.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And they have different
planetary systems.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's not correct
to say that those

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
from Orion or Pleiades
or another star system

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:90%
are like this or like that.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So with that clarification,
what I should highlight

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
is that in the star system
that humans call Orion,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
something extraordinarily
historic happened.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And it has affected
our history not only

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:84%
symbolically, but
literally verbatim,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
from beings who came
from this star system

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
from different worlds,
from different stars

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:90%
in this stellar system.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:90%
And they came to Earth.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And they acted here, and
not always in the right way.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I think the ancient
Egyptians knew this.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm even convinced
of something more,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that the Great Pyramid was
built on an ancient vortex

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:90%
on the Giza Plateau.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the pyramid
is not so important.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But the place where
it was built is.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the pyramid has
its architectural magic,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:90%
mathematics, engineering.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But is clear that
it was not just

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:90%
built to be a tomb of a pharaoh.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
In other interviews
here at Gaia,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I've given my opinion
about the Great Pyramid.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.910 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's a time machine built
on a vortex that is connected

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:90%
to this story of Orion.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What evidence on
Earth is there to give us

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.968 align:middle line:90%
clues about these wars?

00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: It is
extremely difficult

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to obtain uncontested evidence
about this ancient war.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
From a historical and
rational point of view,

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
we can only cling
to legends, myths,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and ancient texts because it
cannot be a coincidence that

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
different cultures and
traditions all over the world

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
talk about exactly
the same thing,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
telling precisely stories of the
conflagration of entities from

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
the sky, as if we humans were
part of some kind of cosmic

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:90%
plan.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.970 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, the
evidence we're also looking for

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
stray from our
scientific methods.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have to explore
them through contact.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And in the contact
realm is where we

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:90%
have obtained more information.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And the account of
the extraterrestrials

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
does not seem to be a delirium
because the information matches

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
that of other contact
witnesses across the world.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:90%
I could even add something more.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I would note that this
is very controversial.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
According to the
message of these beings,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the story of The
War of the Gods,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the distinct positioning
of different extraterrestrial

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.720 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, of the appearance
of human life on Earth,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
our purpose and our path to the
future, and this connection we

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
have with ancient
extraterrestrial

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:90%
civilizations--

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:90%
all that information is in us.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
According to the messages
we have received,

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
it's not only in our genetics,
but also in our being.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So when someone
hears this story,

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:84%
even though it sounds like a
schizophrenic, crazy story,

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:84%
they feel a strange connection,
like it sounds familiar,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:90%
like they want to know more.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
The person feels linked
to this information.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.067 align:middle line:90%
And that's very interesting.

00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You say we have
extraterrestrial genetics

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:90%
in us.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
We are warring
constantly here on Earth.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, in space, is there
a connection there?

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.538 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.538 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I think there
are two types of connections,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Emery.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
One could be genetic
because if in our genes

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
we have information about
extraterrestrial beings,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
very advanced civilizations
that preceded us,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that were
very technological and

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:90%
militaristic--

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
a pattern for colonizing
worlds and advancing in space.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It is likely that, as their
presumed descendants, if we

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
have a part of extraterrestrial
genetics in us, perhaps

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
this may be the reason
why we behave similarly

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:90%
to these beings.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
second explanation

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that worries me even more,
a connection even more

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:90%
powerful than genetics.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether we
have a war gene in us that

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
was sown by
extraterrestrial beings,

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
to see what the human
species would do with that,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
or if we could overcome
it, modifying our behavior,

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and with that, delivering
new information

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to the universe-- there is
a nonphysical connection,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:84%
as if through invisible
forms, we were connected

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
to events occurring in
space, in the universe--

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:84%
generates some kind of influence
on our affairs, and vise versa.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a very interesting
term in the Bible,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:84%
all that is bound or
unleashed on Earth

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
shall be bound and
unleashed in the heavens.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:84%
According to the messages of
these beings from other worlds,

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:84%
we have been assured that when
certain cosmic events occur,

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
it can influence our decisions
and behavior on Earth.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Even when some
anomalies in energy

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
occur in our reality
on the planet,

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
it usually coincides
with events of warfare,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:90%
serious geopolitical situations.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get into
crazy conspiracy theories.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But I must say that many of
the intense events on Earth,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds, usually coincide
with these manifestations

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists
have come to think,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
especially some from
the Russian Federation,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:84%
that according to
our sun's behavior,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
there were big
changes on the planet,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
not only in the weather, but
also in the very mental climate

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
If we take this
to a cosmic scale,

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
with civilizations and beings
that are connected to us,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if anything
that we decide or do

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:90%
affects us holistically.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
This part of the
struggle of forces

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
is what interests me the most
because this confrontation,

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
it seems, doesn't just
happen in the universe.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But it is happening
within ourselves.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
When I asked Ivica and
Antarel, the beings who

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
are in contact with me, what
is the message of these wars

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
of the gods and everything
that's happening now

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
on the planet,
they answered, you

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
are living a war of time,
with multiple possibilities

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
for what you would
call, the future,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:84%
with different civilizations
that are watching us,

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
who, as I said, have different
opinions of the human species.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
The human species is
completely permeable to what

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:90%
happens in the universe.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
As if we were a sponge, Emery,
we are absorbing many things.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So Ivica and Antarel
assured me that if we

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
find an inner balance in
the middle of these changes

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
with very scrambled
timelines, and echoes

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
of that ancient war of
the gods still here,

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:90%
we will find balance and peace.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:84%
That would be the message,
finding peace and balance

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of
confrontation because what

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle line:90%
is peace for the universe?

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Peace is the absence of conflict
in this world, in other worlds,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.800 align:middle line:84%
but starting from
within ourselves.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You speak
of these messages

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that have been coming
here for 50 years

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:90%
from the extraterrestrials.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, what can you tell us
about that cosmic plan?

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I think it is time
to delve into this information.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Since the beginning of
the modern era of UFOs,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:84%
as we all remember,
in the middle

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
of the 1940's, those news
sightings were for a reason--

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:84%
our atomic nuclear
experiments, for example,

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:90%
the Trinity experiment of 1945.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the first contactees
from the United States,

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
like the controversial
case of George Adamski,

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
they asserted that the
extraterrestrials who

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.840 align:middle line:84%
contacted them
acted because they

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:84%
were concerned
about what we were

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:90%
doing with our new weapons.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
To this day, messages
such as these continue.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So different contactees
from the United States,

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Europe, and also Latin America,
were receiving messages

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:84%
with great concern from
the extraterrestrials

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
for our behavior, as
if they wanted humans

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
not to repeat bad situations
that have already occurred

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere in the universe.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:10%
There were even some researchers
in the United States,

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:10%
like Dr. Hurtak, who already,
at the beginning of the 1970's,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:10%
spoke of the importance of
Orion and the events that

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:10%
occurred on Earth.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
According to the
information we obtained

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.720 align:middle line:84%
from different contactees
in Latin America dating back

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
several decades in
Peru, the purpose

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of finding humans
here on Earth is

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to find a new form of evolution,
different from the one faced

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial
civilizations that preceded us.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Like I said minutes ago,
they were very technological,

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.540 align:middle line:90%
militaristic, rational.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And little by little, those
supposed technological advances

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
were causing a disconnection
within themselves.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they lost touch
with their sensitivity,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
as if they became more
mechanical, Emery.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
They were losing their
connection with their emotions,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
with other things that
make us radiant beings.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Not everything should go
solely and exclusively

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
through knowledge, intellect,
technology, and those

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:90%
advancements.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:90%
That's why humans are here.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a cosmic plan,
designed, according

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
to what these messages say,
by the most evolved minds

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:90%
in this part of the universe.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So those world
schools like Earth

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:84%
may harbor a species
that is like a synthesis

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, with
its lights and shadows.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why we would have in
our genetics, as I already

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, the legacy
of Orion, which

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:84%
drives us to be
very intellectual,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
greatly embracing technology.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with technology.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we only concentrate on
that scientific development

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and we lose touch
with the essence,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.770 align:middle line:84%
old patterns in the
cosmos will be repeated.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
If, on the other
hand, Emery, we humans

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:84%
who are in this world school
opt for other ways of evolution,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
using science merely as a
tool, without losing touch

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
with our beings, we are going
to be more conscious beings.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And we will stop
fighting among ourselves.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And there will be no
more polarization,

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:84%
at least as we understand
it with our human perception

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:84%
because on higher planes,
polarization should not exist.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:90%
It is something very different.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But for now, we are
living in this reality.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.390 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
essence of what

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is called the cosmic
plan, that a new species,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
such as the human race,
through love, consciousness,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that we
are part of a very

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:84%
complex history in the universe,
opt for the middle way,

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and become transformed
into a teaching

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
even for the beings
who have preceded us.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Fulfilling that saying, there
is no being, no matter how wise,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:90%
who has nothing to learn.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And there is no being, no
matter how humble and small,

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:90%
who has nothing to teach.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is happening to
us humans on this blue planet.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are the wars of the
gods still going on today?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I'm unsure how
to answer this question.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not a simple yes or no.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, these
clashes between

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.120 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
civilizations are not

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
happening, at least in
our location, at least

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
with the intensity that
they have happened before.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
According to the
information we have,

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
some of these civilizations
that in the past

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
clashed, due to differences
of opinion, currently

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
have a type of non-aggression
pact, holding their positions

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and observing what happens
in worlds like Earth.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean the war is over.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It is happening
in other aspects,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:middle line:84%
in subtle and energetic
aspects, in infiltrations,

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.660 align:middle line:90%
the list goes on and on.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It is still happening.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I would dare to
say to you, Emery,

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:84%
although this sounds
so, so strange,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that this
confrontation of forces

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:84%
nowadays is more
psychic than physical,

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:84%
where human beings are in
the middle of the situation.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, going back
to my description

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:84%
of the shamanic
circles which remind

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
me so much of the experiences
that we extraterrestrial

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
contact witnesses have
had, shaman elders

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
assure us that there
are many forces

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:84%
unknown to human beings who
try to influence and affect

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
our lives.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But none of these forces,
according to the shaman elders,

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
can do whatever they want with
us if we do not first allow it.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It is amazing.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But we are in control
if we want to be.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, that control,
finding that center,

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:90%
is based in consciousness.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And many humans on this
planet, we live like zombies,

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
like robots, totally
asleep, clinging to fear.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And fear is not consciousness.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Fear does not lead you
to other ideal moments

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:90%
of evolution and peace.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why for me,
it is very important

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to analyze the confrontation
of the ancient gods

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:84%
because this war of time
somehow goes on within us.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But this cosmic plan that
I mentioned, what it seeks

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
is for us to find the glimmer
of light in the darkness,

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
as if it were a question
of correcting past events.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And through it, we
gain redemption.

is good for that to happen,
to learn appropriately.

extraterrestrials,
