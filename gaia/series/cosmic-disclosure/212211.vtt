00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.715 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you so much
for having me again.

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, you
used the term called

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional tugging.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.695 align:middle line:84%
Can you please
explain what this is?

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: Yes, so every
storyline in its way

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:10%
has its own end game or its
own result in this matter.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And you might think of this
as a separate life form

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
or at least as a very conscious
sentient life environment.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So these are possible
life environments

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring our own
timeline into and orient

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that vector that we're
on to those environments.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But those life environments,
actually, they are--

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say fight.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But I like the word
tugging actually

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to describe that they
are putting effort

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
to draw souls into their
timeline, their time string.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they're
actually doing.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So the process is that
they have a stable reality

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and more or less dominance
over their own history,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
their own storyline
in that perspective.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And they want people that
bring information, experience,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and their own soul into this.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that terrible
as it might sound.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people,
they fear the word drawing

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:90%
and souls.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
That might sound
terrible for them.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's more like
there are these havens

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:90%
of home in that field.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:90%
And they want to host people.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they are
tugging for in that way.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Some are more forceful
in that matter

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and might even be
dominant over others.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, they all are
creating a life environment.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And they want souls to inhabit
this possibility in order

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.185 align:middle line:90%
to make it thrive.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, that's
a fascinating concept

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
because a soul now
integrates with a frog

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
race, a gray race, a reptilian
race, and so many others.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.935 align:middle line:90%
How does that all work?

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's both again.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually
a magnetic effect.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say that one pole
is attracting the other pole.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It's more of like an
interaction between those.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that
all these different life

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:84%
environments, they have
certain attributes to them.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And they might resonate to
ourselves more than others.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And then we feel attracted.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But they also attract
us in that manner.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's always a
third solution, which is--

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:84%
or third way, which
is always creation.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So any one of us could become
home in their own manner

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
if they have enough
consciousness,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
if they are feeling
stable enough

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:90%
about their own timeline.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So any one of us could
indeed become home

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and attract new and other
souls into their system.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why is it referred
to as an interdimensional

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
tugging when souls migrate
from species to species, not

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.835 align:middle line:84%
only on the planet Earth but
on other planets as well?

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So species
actually are only

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
an embodiment of certain life
environments in that field.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Earth humans are very much
focused on form and specific

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
facts labels, if you
want to speak so.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
the body container

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:90%
does not matter that--

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
or at least the form
of the body container

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
does not matter that much.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
The body itself does matter
because we are always

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
this trinity of body,
consciousness, and soul.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're advised to bring this
body, soul, and consciousness

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
container into whatever life
environment suits us best.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And we should not
strip away one of them

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.485 align:middle line:84%
but make the evolution
of all of them,

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
all our parts
integral in that way.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
it doesn't matter

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
if you're like a frog race or
an exotic type of life form or--

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, not
even be something

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
that we acknowledge as
life form in that way.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
It only matters
that at one point,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
the universe wants to
oversee the whole puzzle

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and see how every piece
in the universe has found

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
its specific place
in its own nature

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
because that is
what we've been told

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
is the moment when the
universe recognizes itself.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It sees itself in the
form it should be.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
it all explodes again.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.165 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story
starts all over again.

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:26.835 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is needed for
that cohesiveness to take place?

00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That pretty much
depends on every aspect.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, every question
needs to be answered,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
every possibility
needs to be explored,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and everyone and every
being and every aspect

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
needs to find wherever they
feel integrated the most.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a complete
picture of the universe.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could it be
said that every question,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:84%
every possibility that
arises from that question

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is played out simultaneously
in multiple versions

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:90%
or parallel versions of Earth?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more like it
all has to be worked out,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:90%
this specific version?

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, so interesting.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on
the observer status.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you're zooming
out pretty much

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and you're only like
observing the one point field,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
then everything is
happening simultaneously.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's more or
less a process that's

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
been observed in
that kind of way.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
inside of time, you're

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
actually experiencing it
because time is always combined

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:90%
with motion in that way.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So everything that happens
needs to be played out

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and with so many still
unsolved questions.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that it
has to take long for it

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:90%
to play out in that perspective.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So what we've been
told is that there

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
were versions of the universe
that were over pretty quickly.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And the universe itself didn't
like that because it was like,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It went from
creation into, oh, we

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
got everything solved
in just one second.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, the
universe is pretty much

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
entertaining itself
through life because that's

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:90%
its home in that way.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
That's what it likes to do if
you want to think about that.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to enjoy
time and movement.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the version that
we're experiencing right now

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:90%
takes time.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would it be fair to say
there's another version of me

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and Tim interacting in
another parallel scenario

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and that the audience is
also interacting but perhaps

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:90%
differently?

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: This is the fractal
nature of the universe.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes from itself.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So the best example for
that is birth in itself.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:90%
So branches come from trunks.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Humans come from humans.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
fractal nature where

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:90%
you can zoom out or zoom in.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:84%
You're always observing the
same structure in that way.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you go down into
the individuality--

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and this is actually
what's playing out right

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:84%
in front of our eyes, which
is individuality, which

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
is the triad of soul, body,
and consciousness-- then

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say that we
found out that it always

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:84%
is dependent on the
observer itself.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you are aware of other
selves in other dimensions,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
in other frequencies,
and other times,

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:84%
then yes, there are other
versions of yourself

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
that are playing out
different other stories.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
aware of that, then

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
yes, there is an observer
that might be playing out

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
possibilities and probabilities
that are similar to yourself.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:90%
But is that really Tim?

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Is that another version of Tim?

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:90%
We observe that.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So an easy example of
that is, for example,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:84%
communication with
ancestors in that way.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's been portrayed in
different ancient tribes

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
that people communicate
with their ancestors

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:90%
after they passed away.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And we even have techniques
where you can see

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and people report
these shadowy beings.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I myself have done those
techniques when I was younger.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had incredible
results with that.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
But is that being
that I'm communicating

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and the shadow that suddenly
appears in the room,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:90%
is that really--

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- my grandma?

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Or is this the information
that comes from the field

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and portrays itself
as my grandma

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to name it.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's no way for us
to answer that actually.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How important are
extraterrestrial intelligences

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
in relation to our earthly and
human experiences when we also

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.042 align:middle line:84%
include the parallel universes
and realities of Earth?

00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: In this version of the
universe and I can confirm

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
everyone who's watching
"Cosmic Disclosure"

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:84%
belongs to the club of those
people who will make contact

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
with ET beings actually
because that's--

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
you won't have an
awareness about that

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
if your soul or
your consciousness

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
or even you on purpose wouldn't
have decided to go this way.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can
humanity effectively

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
navigate conflicts from merging
the parallel versions of Earth?

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And what influence
does that have

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.326 align:middle line:84%
on extraterrestrial
intelligences?

00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the universe wants
to solve the paradoxes.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
what's happening.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you zoom out of
life at a very high level

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, then--

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
at level seven
consciousness, the universe

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is always scanning itself
for points and locations

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
where there are
unsolved paradoxes

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:84%
because in a way,
that's like doing Sudoku

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:90%
for the universe in some way.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have to imagine that the
creator itself is entertaining

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:90%
itself through life.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
see it that way.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:90%
There are other levels to that.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
You also can have an individual
or a love-oriented perspective.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But just for the
moment, let's imagine

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
it's playing Sudoku with itself.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually looking
for paradox spots in itself

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:90%
in order to solve this.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's more or less a puzzle.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So yes, everyone
going through this

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
is still in a world that
experienced certain challenges.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So we've not overcome
duality in an integrated way.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:90%
We're still having conflicts.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We still imagine people to be
different from us in that way.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So we still want to
remain individuals

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:90%
and have our individual paths.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't and if
we've decided to just say,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't care for
my individuality,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I just want to live in a
wonderful harmonious space,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
then it would be much
easier to solve that.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So these are the parallel
versions that already happened.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
If you stick to individuality,
then you stick to duality.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you need
to play it through.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So what Being 6 told us is
that all the conflict and all

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
the warlike nature
of the universe

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
in this version of the universe,
there is no solution to it.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:90%
It needs to play itself out.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
It's much more like the
universe has an affection for

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
like, I don't know,
warlike games or something.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
computer games

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
or console games or
something, it just

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:84%
enjoys to play all these warlike
shooters or something where

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
it goes on missions and
experience all this,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, devastating
gore and experience.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's no way
to prohibit that

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
or to prevent the
universe from doing so.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It just needs to
come to a point where

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
it's just too boring to
play that or even a place

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%
where it's illogical to do so.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're more and more
heading towards that

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
because realize what happens
if we integrate technology,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:84%
if we integrate incarnation
into this reality field.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
More and more of
the warlike nature

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:84%
that organic beings
experience will

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:90%
be turned into a virtual space.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And incarnation will mean that
even if you die, you respawn,

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
if you want to use this
computer term in that way.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So at one point or
another, the universe

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.870 align:middle line:84%
will not be entertained
anymore by that field

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
or even become so much a
game that it doesn't even

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:90%
matter anymore.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, parallel
universes and timelines

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
of Earth ultimately merge so
there aren't multiple versions,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:84%
or will there always
be multiple timelines?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: No, so we have this
movement that it will always

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:90%
merge into one.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we call the
level seven consciousness

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So basically, all the individual
timelines and time strings

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing,
at one point,

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:84%
they always will
come together again

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
integration, the solution

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:84%
of all these different
stories that we have.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And that very moment,
this is the transport

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:90%
to level eight consciousness.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, it
all begins again.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like a breathing,
pulsing motion, or geometry,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:90%
if you want.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And yet
at the same time,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
we have all the different
densities or levels going on.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
fractal nature of it.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So we all have it
layered upon layer.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And all these
layers are actually

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:90%
influencing each other.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So what has been done on
this planet in particular

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:84%
is that the moon itself shields
the planetary environment

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:84%
off from outside higher
frequencies in order

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
to have a cohesive
evolution on the planet,

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a free
evolution on the planet.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Still there were
malevolent forces

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:84%
from outside that overcame
that barrier and influenced

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and set up a system inside
of Earth, the reality

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
field of Earth that is pretty
much toxic and destabilizing.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
But we also need
to overcome that

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a planet
that has the possibilities

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
to strive and to bring
personal evolution

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:90%
for each member of it.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you been
privy to various outcomes

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
of these merging
timelines and potentials?

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And which of all
the probabilities

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:84%
do you see as the
most likely one?

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I've been only
informed about live forms.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And we've only been in
contact with forms of life

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that have reached a level seven
consciousness, actually only

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:90%
one life form.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So there are multiple level
six consciousness beings.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's only one
life form on level

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:84%
seven consciousness, which
doesn't mean that there

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:90%
won't be more than that.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that level
seven consciousness beings

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
will integrate the warrior
nature of the universe

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:84%
into a more playful
version of it.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So it will integrate it
into a more simulated way

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:84%
where people can live out their
aggressions against each other

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:90%
but not in a profound way.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
They will not forget
that they are only

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:84%
playing a video
game in that way,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:84%
just in the way
that everyone who

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is playing a video game at home
is still abstracted from what's

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:90%
happening in the monitor--

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:90%
or on the monitor.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they fully
emerge with the experience

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
They're still
disconnected from that.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
how some of them

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.985 align:middle line:84%
experience fun while
playing those games.

00:17:36.985 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If there
was one takeaway

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to the topic of
interdimensional tugging

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and parallel versions
of Earth that you

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.205 align:middle line:84%
would offer to the audience,
what would that be?

00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Really meditate
and experience yourself

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:90%
in the most--

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:90%
fullest way that is possible.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself to that
version and that home that

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
resonates with you the most
because a lot of people

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
are praying for
peace in that way.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think from the
possibilities and probabilities

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:90%
that peace is--

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:90%
necessarily that it must happen.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are other ways
to integrate conflicts

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
by just making
them less important

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle line:84%
or get yourself disconnected
from conflict in that way.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
something that everyone

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
at home and every
viewer should do

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
because that's when
you benefit yourself

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and the universe the most.
