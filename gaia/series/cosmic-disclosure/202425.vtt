00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.880 align:middle line:10%
we are with David Adair--

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:10%
space technology
transfer consultant,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:10%
US Navy jet engine
technician, field researcher

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:10%
for the Office of Naval
Intelligence, and the list

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:10%
just goes on.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.675 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:32.883 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Thanks, Emery.

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The last time you were
on "Cosmic Disclosure," you

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
mentioned your brother had
these amazing experiences

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:90%
with contact.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Some in relation to Betty Hill.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, my
brother moved up there--

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:90%
moved in with Betty Hill.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And he stayed with her
for about eight years.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.705 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot
of interesting--

00:00:57.705 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you call them--

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:90%
contacts, firsthand stuff.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But my brother would
tell me some things.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing the
details that were involved.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And he mentioned one place,
I take it, it's like a city.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if it's
on a different planet

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
or a different time period
or on a different planet

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:90%
in a different time period.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Confusing.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But I remember
some of the detail.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
The name of the place,
he called it was Pedia.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Think it's P-E-D-I-A. And I've
never heard that word before.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:90%
You know how we know Pleiadians?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar
that, buts its Pedians.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Pedians.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's their world
and where they're from.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.637 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do they look like?

00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The description
of the people

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
he gave, I think,
OK, I got this down.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:90%
I could imagine what it look--

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:90%
It was nothing I was expecting.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
He said their crafts are
field-like aquariums.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:90%
So they float.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.607 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, do they
lock in seats or chairs

00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:90%
when they're flying?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.406 align:middle line:90%
He said, no need to.

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said they're
inertial dampeners

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.212 align:middle line:90%
filters through the water.

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, that
actually makes sense.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Makes sense.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I said,
well, are they fish?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Air breathing?

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but they're in a
constant liquid environment?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Amphibian?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they got gills
under their jaw lines.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they
breath through that.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.632 align:middle line:84%
Right below their ears,
recessed back on the neck.

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I went, well, that
makes sense, too.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Also their eyes, he said,
they have some kind of coating

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
or jelly-like substance
over their eyes.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, that makes sense so they
could see through the water.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So we've got this amphibian
technology capable of way

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
faster than light speeds.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
But the way they get
around that, they

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:90%
don't violate the light speeds.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it reminded me of
a riddle Einstein left us.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, how can you go
millions of the times

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
faster than the speed of
light without breaking

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light and remain
constant in Newtonian physics?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And that thing has haunted me
for years and when I was 18,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:90%
I figured it out.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:90%
There's an answer to the riddle.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I knew about this.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:90%
And remember, this is like 1968.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on this.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
How do you cross from point
A to point B on a paper.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Milky Way Galaxy, Andromeda at
the speed of light, 200 million

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.125 align:middle line:90%
years to get across this page.

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
That's moving at 186,756
miles per second.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And still take you 200 million
years to get across there.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So what you do, people think
you fold it Well, not really.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You roll it like you
do a doobie, I guess--

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, you roll it
and see, like a burrito.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And as the walls are
touching each other,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
in the center where
the filling would be,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:90%
it's where the spacecraft sits.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And the spacecraft reaches
out on a point fixed in space

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and it pulls it to it,
wrapping around it.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Now on a linear
plane, you only had

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to move about that
much because you're

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
jumping through the walls
as they touch each other.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And I coined the phrase it's
transdimensional jumping.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY:
Transdimensional jumping.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.237 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's right.

00:04:56.237 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And this engine I have
would allow you to do that.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And so in real time, you'd
travel about two minutes.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:90%
You shut your engines off.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And now you have traveled
200 million light years

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:90%
in two minutes.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But you did it about
3/4 light speed

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:90%
on that short linear distance.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So you never broke
the speed of light.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But look how far-- but
you went millions of times

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
further and faster than the
speed of light could do it.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what happens
with time during that, David?

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It jumps with you.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
When you land where
you're at, wherever

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
you landed at that's
where your time is,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
based at that point,
that component.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But I'll be the first
to tell you there's

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.015 align:middle line:84%
other things involved in
this I haven't got a clue.

00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how you're
going to communicate or even

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:90%
navigate.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you're
outrunning your headlights.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So how are you
going to navigate?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.767 align:middle line:84%
Or communicate-- and you
tell somebody you're coming?

00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to
have to figure that out.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I just can't seem to--

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.193 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What if you get there
and that star's already out?

00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, that's
the other problem.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You know what I mean?

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, so you
got to communicate.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.123 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You got to communicate.

00:06:08.123 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Anybody there?

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And also, "Star Trek"
jumps around all this,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
dilithium crystals.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The best movie I ever saw
to tell you how complicated

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:90%
this is was "Interstellar."

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
For every five minutes
you're standing over here,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.865 align:middle line:90%
70 years is passing here.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
That's not going
to fare too well

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:90%
from the place you just left.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
You might be out here for
a few days and come back.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've had
1,000 years pass.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Several thousand
years pass, perhaps.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult
in stellar travel.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
There is a way with you
ramping the barrier times.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I would believe,
in there, you're

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
going to be able
to break components

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
where you can cheat relative
to your space and time.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Really?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Which, that
would help a lot.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't had
time to work on that.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:90%
But I think the answer's there.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But whoever these beings are
that's traveling in this stuff,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
they've had to figure
out a time consequence

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
solution, because they're going
to run into the same problems

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
that the "Interstellar"
people did.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:90%
And they're still matter.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.990 align:middle line:90%
They're made of material.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to have to
apply or bend to the same laws

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.590 align:middle line:90%
or rules that--

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're under the
same 3D laws that we are.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah!

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They have to be.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.638 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I'll tell you
something else about them.

00:07:37.638 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gives them
too much knowledge.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're all-knowing,
all-seeing, they all come here.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I got news for you.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.247 align:middle line:84%
They got Murphy's Law up there
about just as bad as we do.

00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:50.163 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, they do.

00:07:50.163 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They make mistakes.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.437 align:middle line:90%
Things happen.

00:07:53.437 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Biggest question I
get is, if they're so smart,

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
why do they get shot down?

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I said, when they enter our
three-dimensional space,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:84%
they fall under the
laws of our 3D world.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's exactly right.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And also, I'm among the type--

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
they spent all that time, money,
send their best personnel here,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:90%
to run a probe up you?

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Because they-- I don't think so.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:84%
There's something
else to all that.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:90%
That's ridiculous.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it's just we
ain't got the real story.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
There's so much we don't
know about what's going on.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
the characteristics

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:90%
do these beings have?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: As he described it
to me, it's fascinating stuff.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
The lower half, like from the
waist down, is like a fish.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Top half on up is humanoid.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And first thing I said, well
dang, there's your mermaids.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:90%
You know, mermen, mermaids?

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Bill said, yeah.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:84%
They had webbing
between their fingers.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:90%
That was perfect.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.802 align:middle line:84%
Their bottom halves
was long and whispery.

00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And we now know,
if you ever looked

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.038 align:middle line:84%
at the scuba fins of the
day, they're three feet long.

00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:06.838 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:07.787 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: So

00:09:07.787 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:90%
there's something to that.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, well,
that's interesting.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And then this really
got good here.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, tell
me about their skin,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
'cause normal skin is not
going takes 24/7 submersion.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:90%
You're going to wrinkle.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.657 align:middle line:90%
You're going to prune.

00:09:22.657 --> 00:09:24.510 align:middle line:84%
You ain't going
to look too good.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said yeah, their
skin is different.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, they don't have
scales like reptiles.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
scales like fish,

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:84%
except the scales that's
on the belly of a fish.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
You ever-- you remember
how fine they are?

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very fine.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You rake a knife
going the opposite direction--

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.407 align:middle line:84%
some people don't
know about that.

00:09:47.407 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:90%
But that's how you skin a fish.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the skin
come off the belly,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:90%
they are just so soft and fine.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But you ever look at
that skin on the belly?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:90%
It's unaffected by water.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So they have a skin like
that coating all over them.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.465 align:middle line:84%
And I said, they must
feel like a dolphin.

00:10:09.465 --> 00:10:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fascinating.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.465 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And he goes, yeah.

00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:14.366 align:middle line:84%
He said interesting word,
species you picked there.

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:17.925 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, their skin
is very similar to a dolphin.

00:10:17.925 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've worked on some
water beings in the projects

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.560 align:middle line:90%
that had--

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
they were by bipedal, but on
the outskirts of their leg,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:90%
it was like a cuttlefish.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:90%
It had these little flaps.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Did he mention
anything like that?

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.682 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No, except their
legs were the flaps.

00:10:32.682 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They were the flaps?

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They were
the flaps, all of it.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.018 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they
couldn't stand on a--

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They could move.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
No, they couldn't
stand up on the land.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But moving
through the water?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Lightening fast.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I bet.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I just--
it was different.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was still stuck with the
skin thing because you know,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
what we call dolphins actually
is a bottle-nosed porpoise.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
A dolphin is an ugly-looking,
blunted-head fish.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:90%
And game fish.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Good to eat, though.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But a porpoise, the bottle-nosed
porpoise, its skin, it's

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:90%
a mammal.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a mammal.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:90%
But it lives under water.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's had to adapt
the perfect skin for it.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And he told me the skin
between a bottle-nosed porpoise

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and these beings--

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.695 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same.

00:11:25.695 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, how does
your brother interact

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
with these beings if they
can't stand, you know?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They can't stand up.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing up
and he's breathing air.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're flopping
around on the ground, there?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:90%
No, it's really cool.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:90%
You know Cameron, James Cameron?

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.915 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: When he made
the movie "The Abyss?"

00:11:42.915 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Remember how they could
move the water about?

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Water was their technology?

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.765 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So these beings
have the same thing.

00:11:48.765 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
They manipulate a pocket
for you to stand in.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And you've got air.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're all around you.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's just they
move the water around.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And he told me
this in the late--

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:90%
actually, early '70s.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:84%
James Cameron didn't make
"The Abyss" until the '90s.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So here, my
brother's a good 20

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:90%
years ahead of all that.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, a thin layer
of water around the being

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
could be manipulated for
anti-gravitic properties,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.667 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I think
that's what they

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.188 align:middle line:84%
were-- it sounds that's how
they were getting around.

00:12:23.188 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, can move
the walls of the water

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
just like we would
move dimensions.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much
more they can do.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
My question him
was, OK, they got

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:90%
you standing in this dry spot.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:90%
They're all around you.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:90%
How are you communicating?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- you know,
did you have a teletype?

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, we are all water.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, he said
he just heard them.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%
He could hear them.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Mental telepathy.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So they
just talked to him.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you could
hear their voices.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't see
any mouths moving.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said they were
friendly to get along with.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And their spacecrafts, they
could go to great depths,

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:84%
to the Challenger
Deep, 37,000 feet down.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Or they could go into
space, total vacuums.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.165 align:middle line:90%
To them, it was no difference.

00:13:28.165 --> 00:13:28.998 align:middle line:90%
It's all just space.

00:13:28.998 --> 00:13:30.498 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're
in their own space.

00:13:30.498 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:90%
They can go anywhere.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything more that
they said about using water

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:90%
as technology?

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, they're
perturbed by the way

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:90%
we're working on this planet.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they came to this
planet, we're a water world.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
If you approach this planet
from the center of the Pacific

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Ocean, you don't see any land.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing but a water world.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We're a water planet with
seven floating tectonic plates.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what we are.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And so they picked this planet
because it had so much water

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
on it, which is
not easy to find.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And then you got to--

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
taking the water?

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Are they are they
residing here right now?

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah,
they've been here.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
They were here--

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How long
have they been here?

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: A billion
years or more.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
They were here before
these dinosaurs,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:90%
before any amphibians.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
They may have started
the amphibians.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But they were here before there
was any life on the planet.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It just still the ooze and
the iron and all the elements

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:90%
coming together.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It was
just Pangaea, huh?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, before Pangaea's time.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.515 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Before Pangaea.

00:14:44.515 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They've been
around for a long time.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're just concerned
the way we're behaving.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Now this was interesting.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:84%
He said they said
that you just assume

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.037 align:middle line:90%
that this planet is yours.

00:15:01.037 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And you got-- you
ever notice how much

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:90%
lifeforms you've got on it?

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.978 align:middle line:90%
And that ain't normal.

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Definitely not normal.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, this
planet is far from normal.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Most of the other
planets have nothing.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:12.355 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:15:12.355 --> 00:15:14.272 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: When they do,
they have a little bit.

00:15:14.272 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
You guys got not thousands--
you got millions of lifeforms

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:90%
on one single little ball.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And you make the
assumption you own it all?

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they just
reside in the ocean?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Did they actually help develop
all the lifeforms here?

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: From what I can tell.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get any
direct answers on that.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But just the way
they talk, stuff

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:84%
they're communicating
to my brother,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.463 align:middle line:84%
I would think that yeah, they
had a hand in everything.

00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They would have to.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this sounds like--

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I've researched a lot my whole
life, seen a lot of things.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:84%
This seems like probably one
of the most advanced life

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:90%
forms I've ever heard.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, it's--

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I like the way that they
use the water technology.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But they have other
forms of technology

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.435 align:middle line:84%
that, really, more designed
for dry land use than--

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
so it makes me think
that yeah, they've

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:90%
been involved in everything.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if they haven't
even evolved to land beings,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
they have beings that
now stay on the land.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
There's so much about
them I don't know.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, if they have
that type of technology to get

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
around the universe and they
have these craft to go anywhere

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:90%
on the planet--

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and the secret here is water,
as you know, the formation

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:90%
for everything.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And they conquered all that.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: What gives
validity to all that--

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
we should have,
by now, we should

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:90%
have had an "Independence Day."

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
You know, something not a little
long-necked rubber alien ET,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:90%
phone home--

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:84%
something that's here to
take everything it wants.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%
In its way, it just kills you.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:90%
Can we cohabitate?

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:90%
No, you just die.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be warring
fractions like that out there.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think something's saved
our bacon more than once.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, there is.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
big protection of

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%
many different extraterrestrial
civilizations out there.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
What I've gathered
through my experience was

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I was told by
extraterrestrials, we

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.165 align:middle line:84%
are the Disney World
of the universe.

00:17:42.165 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Makes sense.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.248 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's why they
come and visit and watch

00:17:45.248 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and look over us.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of like the gem
because we're so diverse.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
They think we're
the superheroes.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Even though the
movies play them out

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to be the most amazing
creatures, they look at us,

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, they've
been through so much hardship.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.083 align:middle line:84%
They've been through
so much war and disease

00:18:01.083 --> 00:18:03.083 align:middle line:84%
and killing each other,
and they're still there.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And still here.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We're the
most resilient virus

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:90%
We really are like a virus.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:90%
We adapt so fast.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I get tired
of people telling me we're

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:90%
so special, we're so special.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there going,
I don't know, man.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.563 align:middle line:84%
We're just a miserable
liberal speck--

00:18:22.563 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --of dust
in the cosmos.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see how
we're all that special.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But buddy, there's
something about us

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:90%
that catches their attention.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:90%
There are unique things with us.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Our sense of humor,
there's nothing like it

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:90%
with all the aliens.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:90%
No other races got humor.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to
understand, which I could see,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
because we have light
humor, we got dark humor.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not confusing enough,
we categorize it even deeper.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what technology
that they have that's

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.807 align:middle line:84%
actually better on the
surface of the Earth?

00:19:04.807 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's a good question.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Because some of my
technology and theirs--

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:90%
they're mirrors.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.957 align:middle line:90%
They're twins.

00:19:13.957 --> 00:19:14.757 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my.

00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I'm using the
same thing they're using,

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
which made it easy
for me to understand

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:90%
when they started telling me.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Such as?

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Electromagnetic
fusion containment.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Most people go, oh yeah,
I was talking about that

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:90%
this morning.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.365 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:19:34.365 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
In the design that
I built, I was

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
able to create a magnetic
bottle, magnetic sphere.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And that thing is
so powerful, it

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
can contain a nuclear
chain reaction.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
You could detonate an H
bomb in it and contain it.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:90%
And people say, that's nonsense.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no such-- what is that?

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I say, it does it all
the time in space.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:90%
They're called black holes.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They're just
magnetic bottles that

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
have stretched out to enormous
lengths called singularities.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.735 align:middle line:84%
And at the event
horizon, the opening,

00:20:16.735 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:90%
matter get pulled in there.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
If you got pulled
into a black hole,

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
it'd stretch you miles,
20, maybe 100 miles long--

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:90%
still be alive.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But you'll be
stretched out that way

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
'cause of the gravitational
currents are so powerful.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But see, a black hole
can pull up next to a sun

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and pull it in.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's gone.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:90%
X-rays can't escape.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a
magnetic containment

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
field of that level,
you detonate that.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:84%
What you want you can tap
into is the power of the sun.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And you have various ways
of transferring that power.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
If it was in water, it
would be hydroelectric dams.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the electrical power
this thing would put out.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But it also is not a bad
way of getting around.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And even if you had a
craft that's liquid fueled,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
you'd still use this
drive to get around.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And you'd use it when
you get to a planet.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It works best for them
than engaging other devices

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:90%
like their water technology.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.277 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
create things with that?

00:21:33.277 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you should
be able to create--

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You should be able
to create your own water

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, you
have your own power.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.243 align:middle line:90%
You become a utility company.

00:21:41.243 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
You have your own
water and power.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, you create
unlimited energy in this thing.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Because of the heat
that's contained,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:84%
my engine, when it's running
and the field and stabilized,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.053 align:middle line:84%
I'm idling at about 100
million degrees centigrade.

00:21:58.053 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Shwew.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's 10,000
times hotter than the sun.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And because you're
dealing with areas

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
outside the forces of nature
that's in a natural state,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.540 align:middle line:84%
you're creating and
concentrating them.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is this a dark matter?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.843 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This is opposite.

00:22:18.843 --> 00:22:20.127 align:middle line:90%
This is a black hole.

00:22:20.127 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No, if it-- yeah.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And if anything,
this is functioning

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:90%
in a very light matter world.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you were
able to stabilize it?

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.207 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:22:31.207 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And contain that?

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's amazing.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:40.805 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: When a UFO blinks on
and off, it's not blinking.

00:22:40.805 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:90%
It's actually moving.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It's got the electromagnetic
fusion containment power unit.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And what it's doing is simply--

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
what you see as a blink is
actually so fast it's moving.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Blinks out here,
blinks over here.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It's moved across the horizon
fast as you blink your eyes.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they're able
to jump such great distances--

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and not do it in millions of
years, but relatively quick.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But they
still have mass.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it with mass.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So there must be some
sort of containment unit

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
around the entire
being and the craft.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: There is.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.058 align:middle line:90%
That's a good assumption.

00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:90%
That's when I found out--

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I built a containment cell to
house the power for the engine.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw
this secondary set

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:90%
of algorithms that were bending.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And I went, what is that?

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually the
best way to describe it,

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:84%
if you could see it, it's
like a stack of donuts.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And your spacecraft is in
the center where the hole is.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And this secondary
field is wrapped

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:90%
around the ship on the outside.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And you get it stabilized.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Then-- so this is the navigation
that you have to figure out--

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:90%
you pick a point.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you pull the
fabric of space

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and wind it right
in front of you.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Then you jump through
the linear walls.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.467 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes, you shut off.

00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:90%
And you've traveled.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.842 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're
saying that you're

00:24:16.842 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
creating a gravitational field
in front of your destination.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.368 align:middle line:90%
And you get pulled into that?

00:24:22.368 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Actually,
just the opposite.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:90%
You're pulling it to.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're
pulling it to you.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: You are--

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.142 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: All right,
that makes sense.

00:24:28.142 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And this
fabric of space--

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to
fall on a linear plane.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.775 align:middle line:90%
That's slow, man.

00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, right.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
David, where are they
actually from in the universe?

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, the Pleiadians,
that's not like Pleiades.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It's "Padians," is the
correct pronunciation.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: "Padians."

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The Pedians,
apparently they

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
originated out of the
constellation Orion, which

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:90%
is a very huge constellation.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.222 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's enormous!

00:24:59.222 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Lots of communities.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But what's cool about that is
they're not in the star system.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They're in between the planets
and in between the galaxies.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like a
whale in deep ocean,

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:84%
these beings are
deep space beings.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
We didn't think there was
any planets or solar systems

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:90%
in between galaxies.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
But Hubble showed us there is.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And these things, I told my
brother back in the 1960s.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.080 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
solar systems out there.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, we never found any
till just few years ago.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what your brother
experienced, was it in the 3D?

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Or was it a conscious
meditation he was going through?

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You know,
thought the same thing.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I thought, is he just
hallucinating all of this?

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Have we got any tangible
stuff to look at?

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.915 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, it's 3D.

00:25:52.915 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:84%
They show up and
they talk to me.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I'm in some
kind of tag monitor program.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:90%
So they come by frequently.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and
every time they do,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.540 align:middle line:84%
it's that thing in my back
and neck that they jab at.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.165 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he actually
has an implant?

00:26:08.165 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I said, whoa, wait a minute.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean,
back of your neck?

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:90%
So he said, yeah, look at it.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They were just
here two days ago.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at it.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a hole in
the back of his neck

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:84%
so deep I can see
white at the bottom.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the vertebrate.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, you're
a class 2 diabetic.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to heal up
with this wound that deep.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a puncture wound.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh yeah.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
They leave it like that
for about 48 hours,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.940 align:middle line:84%
then gets a little white
crusty thing on top.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.466 align:middle line:84%
And then one more day
after that, you flick it.

00:26:43.466 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And it flicks off.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's no mark.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, yeah, right!

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.898 align:middle line:90%
Class two diabetic!

00:26:50.898 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that's a--

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.815 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So I said, I'm
coming back tomorrow.

00:26:53.815 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll take you to the ER.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:90%
So I came back tomorrow.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, there was a
little white flaky disc type

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:90%
thing on it.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:90%
He said, give it one more day?

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, I will.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I came back.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.912 align:middle line:84%
And next day, he said,
I didn't touch it.

00:27:08.912 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:90%
I was going to let see do it.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Flick it.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And I flicked it.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.300 align:middle line:90%
And there's not a mark.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a type two
diabetic, 48 hours earlier

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.310 align:middle line:84%
had a puncture wound all
the way to the vertebrate.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.705 align:middle line:90%
And there's no mark.

00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's incredible.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: He said, that's normal.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.255 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens every
three days after a visit.

00:27:28.255 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, I'm a
wound care specialist.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And it takes weeks to--

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And that-- and
right around the hole, no--

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Scar?

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.807 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No inflammation.

00:27:36.807 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No redness?

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No redness.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No tightness
of the skin, or any--

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Just like, no stress at all.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, man!

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, you could use that
in surgery, couldn't you?

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you do an
ultrasound or X-ray or anything

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
He's very finicky
about those things.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm sure.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: So I was just--

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I saw enough right there to
know something's up, y'all.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:05.025 align:middle line:84%
But he said they've been
doing that for 20 years.

00:28:05.025 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it'll leave you
no harm, full side effects--

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:90%
you won't get infected.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.855 align:middle line:90%
You won't get sick or anything.

00:28:12.855 --> 00:28:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
still here now?

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, they're
still coming and visiting.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:90%
But he's done this again.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:84%
He's done this-- one time
when he moved to Betty Hill

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:90%
for eight years.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Never heard from him.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We all thought he was dead.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Never heard, spoke, no letter,
no phone call, no contact--

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.630 align:middle line:84%
then one day he just
shows up at the house.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do you think they
affected Earth and humanity,

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:90%
if anything?

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I think
they've been involved

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:84%
in here in a lot of ways way
back at the very beginning.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we,
as a homo sapien,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that creature goes through
changes as these aging--

00:28:54.510 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
from creation or conception
all the way to a baby,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.382 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of different
stages going on in there.

00:29:02.382 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's even
one point where we

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:90%
go through an amphibian stage.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:10%
And we actually have a tail.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.357 align:middle line:10%
Everybody has a tail
when they're born,

00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:11.940 align:middle line:10%
as they're going
through this process.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:84%
In evolution, the
tail is knocked off.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.258 align:middle line:90%
But once in awhile, it doesn't.

00:29:16.258 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And they're born with it.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:90%
And you've seen people.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I've seen them.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.982 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They've even got the--

00:29:19.982 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:90%
name a foot-long once.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:90%
And they'll cut it off.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:90%
But that's from their influence.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I think they influenced
our evolution, which is why

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.090 align:middle line:90%
we have this amphibian stage.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's this big gap, too,
in science, from Cromagnon

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:90%
What happened in between?

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, they
must've came in.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Somebody did something.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Somebody intervened.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And whoever it is,
that's your missing gap.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
going to find them.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And it just jumped us, all
of a sudden, from a primate

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.492 align:middle line:84%
to Cro Magnon, and Piltdown
Man, and all that crap.

00:29:57.492 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: David, thanks
for coming on the show--

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:90%
fascinating stuff.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It's always such a
pleasure to have you here.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I'm
glad to be here.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
If you people make
me think of things

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I normally don't,
then after I leave,

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I got to ponder for a while
the possibility of things

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And boy, don't think you know
what's going on, 'cause you

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:90%
know how much I've learned?

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I know for sure
is I know nothing for sure.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We always die
dumb, my mother said.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I
just-- people think I'm

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.730 align:middle line:90%
the brightest bulb in the box.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:90%
I can't even find the box.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just so much
out there we just

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.228 align:middle line:90%
have no idea what's going on.

00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
