00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY WEIDNER: Hey, everybody.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.900 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to another edition
of "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
We're back with Jason
Rice, our intrepid member

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:90%
of the Secret Space Program.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> JASON RICE: I'm
doing great, Jay.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for having me again.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:10%
>> JAY: Yeah, it's
great to have you back.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about some of the
unusual medical devices

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:10%
that you witnessed
when you were serving

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:10%
with IDARF, which is the
Interplanetary Defense

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:10%
and Reaction Force.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Oh, sure thing, Jay.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
I came in contact

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
with related to
medical technology

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
was the active scanner that
we had to pass through just

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to get into the medical wing at
the FIG base, Fort Indiantown

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Gap, our first
training location.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, what had happened
before my arrival was

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that there were
certain lifeforms that

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
were trying to gain access
into the medical wing, which

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
is a highly controlled area
in which they did not want

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
the nanite technology that
was there to either be hacked,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
or have a virus
introduced into it.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
instances that really

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%
brought this issue
to their attention

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:90%
was that they had someone that--

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:84%
unknownst to them-- had carried
something into the medical wing

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and caused all kinds
of problems and issues

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
with all of the existing
nanite treatments

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
that they had there at the time.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And as a concern for ensuring
that they didn't repeat

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of
infections, they set up

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
a very tightly-controlled
security checkpoint

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
at the entrance into
the medical wing.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And this secured checkpoint
included a locked room

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
that every person coming in
and out has to be scanned.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
It uses a scalar
scanning technology

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
which allows for observance
in an active manner of what's

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:90%
going on within the body.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But it also allows
them to view and see

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
some of the different
energetic fields

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:90%
that are produced by the body.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the carriers that they

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
were able to penetrate
the lab originally,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
was through an
energetic carrier.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.524 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: An alien group was
trying to get into this lab?

00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you said?

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It was an alien
intelligence that was trying

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:84%
to gain access to
the nanites, and did.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up
losing a bunch.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: To what end was the--

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Controlling it.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.583 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: What was the goal?

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The goal
was to hijack it.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Hijack it.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: So anybody that had
been, or would have been,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.840 align:middle line:84%
received the treatment
of those tainted nanites,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:84%
would have been susceptible to
outside or remote activation

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
or control, or basically a
Manchurian candidate in which

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
they were able to gain access
to areas that they wouldn't have

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:90%
had access to.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Wouldn't
it be easier, then,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to wait till you were outside
the room and then hack you

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:90%
electronically?

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.345 align:middle line:90%
Accurate nanites?

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There are certain
safety protocols in place once

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:90%
the nanites are embedded.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And keep in mind
that the process

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
of the nanite enhancement
therapies taking root

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:90%
is about a 24-hour process.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
for that is that it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
has to gain entry into the
far reaches of every nook

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:90%
and cranny in your body.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, that
takes 8 to 12 hours

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
for it to work its way
into those remote tissues.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, once it's in place
in the human body,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
the soldier that it is a part
of has certain safeguards.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are also
certain command safeguards

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that are available to prevent
them from being hacked.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And so this alien group
was trying to get into the room

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
to technically change
the nanites itself?

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Technically, to infect
the nanites with their own

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
energetic signature so that they
could then remotely, at will,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
control certain aspects, or
be able to control the host,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:90%
the individual.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And I take it this
alien group was not successful?

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They were
not successful.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
They did end up infecting
all of the stores

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
of nanite enhancement therapies
that were there at the time.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
monitoring process

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that's 24/7 at the
facility is to look out

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:90%
for certain signatures.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And so once they determined
that that signature was present,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
they were alerted to
what was happening,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.970 align:middle line:84%
even though they didn't
know the full extent of what

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.787 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: This scanning device,
did it see your organs,

00:05:34.787 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and your blood flow, and--

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Oh, yeah.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an
amazing technology.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The guy that's running
the security booth

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
is a specialist, a soldier that
is not a medical technician.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But the ability to
use that technology

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to see the actual blood flow,
to watch the heart beating,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to see the things going
through your digestive system.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can adjust and tune
it in to varying depths,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
or various focal
points in the body,

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:84%
to even be able to see
synaptic firings in the brain.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Wow.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: So when I came
out the other side,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:84%
after passing through that scan,
I came up to the window to get

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
my orders and the things
that I had carried with me.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to
notice, it's not

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:90%
like a regular monitor screen.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:90%
It's an entire wall.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked on the wall
and saw that they still

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:90%
had my image up.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And I could see everything
from head to toe.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the other
reason for the locked room

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
was so that they could now
have anybody that was carrying

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
an unauthorized
carrier, or infection,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:90%
is now locked in a room.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
This particular
security room also

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
had hidden gun ports that were
accessible from the control

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
room side.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't see where they
were, but once they're fired,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
the wall disappears, and the
person inside, if they're not

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
subdued, it takes care of hiding
it so that you don't see where

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
they're coming from, because
those that have been infected

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and that go psychotic, the
best place for somebody

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:90%
like that is in a locked room.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
that provides.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So through the scan,
they might discover tainted

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:90%
nanites.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Correct.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: I got it.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Correct.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.477 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And how
long ago was this,

00:07:43.477 --> 00:07:44.685 align:middle line:90%
that you saw this technology?

00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: This was in 1997.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They're portable to an
extent that they also

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
have handheld scanners that
are able to do the same thing.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So you could walk up to somebody
with a handheld scanner,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:90%
and look into--

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.182 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Like Bones
in "Star Trek."

00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Like Bones
in "Star Trek," yeah.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You see the-- whether
there's a break,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.226 align:middle line:84%
if it's a hairline, whether
it's a fracture at this point.

00:08:07.226 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well, that'd be very
useful in battle situations.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Oh, It's tremendously
useful in being able to see

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and locate specifically
where the problem is.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just limited
to bones and tissue,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
but organs, or shrapnel,
and where that shrapnel

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%
ended up traversing through.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are certain metals
or certain elements that

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
are unreactive to the
nanites, and those

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:84%
have to be removed through
more conventional, or from some

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of the more advanced
surgical methods.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do these nanites have
any effect on psychology,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:90%
or the human mind?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, some of the
adverse effects of the nanites

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:90%
include--

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:84%
part of the protocols are that
you can control adrenal, sweat,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
sleep, nutrient, water, and
you can do it to such an extent

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that the nanites can use
up all available nutrients,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you're left
with nothing but a crash.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And so knowing the
balance of how much you

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
can use, how much you can do,
how much your body stores.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Part of the training
was learning

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:84%
to know what those
boundaries are.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
The additional nanite
enhancement therapies on

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
not just the eyes and the
ears, but the pineal gland,

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and being able to focus
energy and attention

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:90%
onto certain parts.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we
had to do to learn

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
about our nanite
enhancement therapies

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:84%
was, one of the
feedback procedures

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is that certain nanites can
be switched on to vibrate.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
way to describe it.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what you can do is, as
part of the learning process,

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
to be able to identify
all the different parts

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
on your body that are
either sick, or injured,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:90%
or need more nutrients.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And by having a
biofeedback loop in which

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.717 align:middle line:84%
nanites, for instance, in the
tip of your finger, vibrate--

00:10:23.717 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
for the lack of a better
way of putting it--

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
you can identify,
OK, that's what

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
the tip of my finger at
that spot feels like.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And so that has to be calibrated
through all of the body

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
so that you can identify, then,
the different systems that you

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:84%
either need to turn on or
off, augment, accelerate.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
the pineal gland,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and being able to identify what
that feeling feels like to say,

00:10:54.990 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, I need to concentrate
and focus, not on my kneecap,

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:90%
but on the pineal gland.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It allows for a
better performance

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:84%
of the specific organ,
or gland, or system

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking to enhance.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is all
enhancing the existing body.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: It must be like an
artificial intelligence program

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.426 align:middle line:90%
running the nanites, then?

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: It is a certain kind.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
It is not an autonomous
artificial intelligence,

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
because it relies on the
body, the person, the soldier

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to be the artificial
intelligence, if you will,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:90%
the brain.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:84%
There are some
autonomous systems

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:84%
with the nanites
that do not require

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:84%
an input from the soldier,
or from the individual.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of them
are operator operated.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: It's also interesting
that this is taking place here

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, you're saying.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:90%
All of the--

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that I realized

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is that having a biofeedback,
and being able to concentrate,

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and the discipline
and focus in doing

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
that, we don't
really need nanites

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:90%
to achieve that ability.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:10%
You hear of monks that
are able to sit out

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:10%
amongst freezing temperatures
on the side of a mountain

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:10%
overnight, and are able
to regulate their own body

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:10%
temperature.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:90%
This is the same kind of thing.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have nanite
enhancement therapies to be

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:90%
able to do this.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a shortcut, and it
cuts down the amount of time

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
it takes to be able to
master those types of skills,

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:44.936 align:middle line:84%
but we're all equipped
with the basic structure

00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:46.185 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do it ourselves.

00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So you're telling me
that you were able to regulate

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:84%
the temperature of
your body at will?

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.215 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: With the nanite
enhancement therapy, yes.

00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So you could be in
freezing cold weather and be

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.553 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Absolutely.

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
You could also redistribute
oxygen throughout your body

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
so that you can hold your breath
for longer periods of time.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You could cool off
your body faster

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
using the nanite
enhancement therapies.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
You could regulate or
change sleep patterns

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
by altering certain
hormones in your system

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
so that you didn't have
a need to get to sleep.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
It eventually catches up to
you if that's gone on too long.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Sleep deprivation is
certainly one of the problems

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.595 align:middle line:90%
to avoid, is that the body--

00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Very prevalent
in a war-like situation.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Right.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: So were there ever--

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:84%
did you ever witness any kind of
cloning programs in the IDARF?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: At the end of
our training period,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
they told us that they'd
notified our families that we

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:84%
were dead as a motivator to keep
us going forward and to mess

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:90%
with our minds, basically.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
You have no choice but
to continue on the course

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:90%
that you're on.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And some of our
families received

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
clones that matched 100%
from head to toe so that they

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.384 align:middle line:90%
would have a body to bury.

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So you had a clone of
you always there in case you

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:90%
needed it?

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Not like that.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It was more like they
had all the measurements

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and the analytical
information in order

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:90%
to do what they needed to do.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
They had our DNA on file if
they needed to create a clone.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the only clones
that I was exposed to

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:84%
or familiar with,
I learned about it

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
when I was an instructor at
the 333rd back at the FIG

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
at the end of my career.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So you're in a battle,
the nanites can help you

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
to a certain degree.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you got hit by
a large-caliber weapon,

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
what happens in the
field when that happens?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:90%
What's the procedure?

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, the nanites also
are able to close off blood

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:84%
circulation so that, if you did
have a soldier that lost his

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.127 align:middle line:90%
arm, he wouldn't bleed out.

00:15:06.127 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Well, that's good.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: So it would shut
off the blood capillaries

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:84%
to prevent loss of
any more fluids.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And it took anywhere from
10 to 30 seconds for it

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:90%
to fully take effect.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And those were part of the
more autonomous features

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:90%
of some of the nanites.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
If you had a condition
where a soldier was

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:84%
in extreme medical
distress, then the nanites--

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
one of the protocols is to
put the soldier into a coma

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.640 align:middle line:84%
so that it would slow down
all of their processes,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and so that the chances of
them surviving increase,

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
so that they're no longer
freaking out over the fact

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that they've lost
multiple limbs,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.278 align:middle line:90%
and there's blood everywhere.

00:15:53.278 --> 00:15:55.989 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And I think you
said in a previous program,

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
they could actually
replace your arm.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And grow it back.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Grow it back through
a advanced technology.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The process that I
went through was--

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:84%
it involved a submersion
in a gel-like substance.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.484 align:middle line:84%
And it involved, essentially,
a 3D printing of--

00:16:14.484 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:90%
they had everything on file.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So they knew everything down to
the last capillary on my body,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and so they were
able to recreate it.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
The challenge was not in the
recreation of the lost limbs.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
The challenge was in
re-learning to use those,

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
because even though
the pathways are still

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
same old pathways,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.664 align:middle line:84%
there's still a transition
that has to take in effect.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You have to learn
motor control, and--

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: To learn
motor control, yeah.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: --gets funky.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that
before, by the way.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:90%
So you're in the field.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Do people actually die then?

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Soldiers actually die?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Soldiers die.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Something which is so
traumatic that there's nothing

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:90%
they can do about it?

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Mm-hm.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
For instance, after the
KEW attack on Area 26,

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:90%
we had soldiers we never found.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we found pieces.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: KEW is?

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The kinetic
energy weapon.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:05.644 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:17:05.644 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The large meteor impact
on the adjacent freshwater

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:90%
ocean.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:84%
There were a number of soldiers
that we found pieces of,

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and there were other
soldiers that--

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
just never found
anything left of them.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are soldiers
that died during the process.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: But I guess the ultimate
goal is to make a soldier that

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:90%
avoids death, of course.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
That avoids death, and
has the best chances

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
of surviving in the full
range of adverse conditions,

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.107 align:middle line:84%
from cold weather,
to hot weather, to--

00:17:38.107 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Are there medical
personnel among you when

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:90%
you're out in the field?

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There are medical
personnel among us in the form

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:84%
every soldier, as
part of the training,

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
receives a pretty
extensive medical training.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember any of the
medical training itself,

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
except to say that
I went through it

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
so that each soldier has the
ability, and an equivalent

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:90%
training as a medic.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, part of
our mandate was

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
for the training
and coordination

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:90%
of the local populations.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And it also meant that
we were able to help

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.185 align:middle line:84%
those local populations
with medical treatments.

00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Previously, you
mentioned something called

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:90%
neural interface technologies.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain what
that is in more detail?

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
The neural interface
technologies that we used

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:84%
was augmented by the nanite
enhancement therapies.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It allowed us a
direct interaction

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
with computer or software that
had that connection ability.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: What is it?

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:90%
What is neural interfacing?

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It is control of
either a weapon system,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
a guidance system,
flight system,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
a drive through the mind
instead of a direct joystick,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:84%
or steering wheel, or
something physical.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And being able to control
the interaction interface,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
the human machine
interface through the mind,

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
instead of having
something physical.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Probably, they have
this technology, I would say.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: They do.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Quite useful, huh?

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: It is very useful.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The neural interface
technology was

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
very specific in its
guidelines on what,

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
how, where could be
controlled, so it wasn't what

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
could conventionally be
considered a mind-machine bond.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It was more of an
interface, if you will,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to be able to control
multiple things at one time.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the pilots that
were in charge of the shuttles

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
were able to monitor, and
either identify or target

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
certain things for
the targeting officer,

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
as well as flying the
shuttle at the same time,

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as monitoring
and keeping

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.069 align:middle line:84%
an eye on certain systems
within the shuttle,

00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
tell whether or not

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:84%
there's crosswinds,
or the temperatures,

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and making adjustments.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Having the ability to remove
the sometimes clumsy interfaces

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and allowing a person to
directly neural interface

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
with something cuts down the
reaction time tremendously,

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and it also increases and
improves the efficiency.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So you're saying the
pilot can just say, rear gun,

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
fire, and it'll happen?

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: If it's automated.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of the targeting systems,
he could call out or at least

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
highlight certain things to
the gunner so that-- hey,

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:90%
pay attention over here.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I see something
happening on that side.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.279 align:middle line:90%
And then highlight it.

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I've seen just

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
recently is DARPA coming
out with neural interfaces

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:84%
for their soldiers,
and that they're

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
advertising this technology as
something that's new when it's

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.080 align:middle line:90%
been around for a long time.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:84%
They're just finally
deciding to come out with it.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: If they have this
technology, you say they do--

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:84%
then, if anybody messed
with the powers that be,

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.739 align:middle line:84%
couldn't they just
release soldiers

00:21:23.739 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that have all this technology
right here on Earth

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.442 align:middle line:84%
and take care of any
situation if they wanted?

00:21:28.442 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The oaths that were
taken were based on upholding

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and following moral,
ethical standards.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And being deployed against
a civilian population

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
does not fall into
that category.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So you never fought
against civilian populations

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:90%
in IDARF?

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: We helped
to manage some riots,

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
but that didn't involve
military technology being used

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.915 align:middle line:84%
in the application of
suppressing civilians, no.

00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: But theoretically, a
group of military people here

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:84%
on Earth could have these super
soldiers come against them,

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: They could.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:90%
They could.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do you
think that happens?

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I don't think
it's going to happen simply

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
because, number one, the biggest
thing that we have going for us

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is the suppression
of the technology.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Having that come out
in a big way like that

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
would be a large opening
into the disclosure picture.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Did you ever receive
any advanced technology from

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials?

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The extraterrestrials
that we came in contact with

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
IDARF were of a very specific
technological advancement.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
You think somewhere around an
equivalent Earth, 1850s, just

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
at the cusp of
Industrial Revolution.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So the technologies-- with
a couple of exceptions--

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that we came across were not
in advance of what we had.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:10%
Now, some of the things that
I came across on Planet One,

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:10%
for instance, in which
the civilizations there

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:10%
were using the
planetary-produced voltage

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:10%
differential to create
electricity, something

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:10%
similar to the Wardenclyffe
Tower like Tesla

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:10%
had used, in which
they were using

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:10%
the potential of the Earth,
and the difference between that

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.300 align:middle line:10%
and the atmosphere, to
generate an electricity.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So having not seen
that technology

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:84%
before our deployment
to Planet One, for me,

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.364 align:middle line:90%
that was a new technology.

00:23:46.364 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
However, it had been around
since the turn of the century.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.265 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So they're using the
Tesla technology to generate

00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:52.065 align:middle line:90%
electricity?

00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: They were.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It was a DC form that
they used for lighting

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:90%
and for a few other things.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't really advanced
it beyond being able to use it

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.525 align:middle line:90%
for light, or artificial light.

00:24:06.525 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So would
they set up a tower?

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
A Wardenclyffe tower and
start generating it, or what

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:90%
was the technology behind it?

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They built it
into their buildings.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.885 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Oh, they did.

00:24:15.885 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: So their dwellings,
each of their dwellings.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine a circular
yurt-like building, sometimes

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
one story, sometimes
three, with a conical roof

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:90%
that had a spire on top.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of the spires had a
built-in airflow system into it

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
so that the normal
differences in temperature

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and thermal variations
within a building

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
would cause the heat to rise
and cold air to flow in.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So they used it for cooling,
as well as the spire

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.499 align:middle line:84%
on the top for part of
the electrical generation.

00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: But this technology
you're talking about,

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:90%
this is Tesla.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:90%
This is not ET technology.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: No, these
were ET technologies,

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the humanoid ETs that we
came across on Planet One.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And they had perfected
Tesla technology on their own?

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They
hadn't perfected it.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:84%
They'd discovered it
and had been using it.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
But then again, remember
that their civilizations

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
weren't driven by a need
to invent and improve.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Their civilizations were more
of a, find something that works,

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:90%
and it's OK if it stays there.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.480 align:middle line:90%
They were--

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Kind of a steady state.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Steady state.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a great
way of putting it.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What is some of the most
amazing technology you saw when

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.695 align:middle line:84%
you were there in IDARF besides
the scanners and all that?

00:25:37.695 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Some of the really
amazing technologies that just

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
blew my mind, I think had to
do with some of the force field

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
The spacecraft that we
came across and used.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Just the sheer size
of some of the crafts

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that were used as part of
the SSP, just enormous.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.981 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: How big?

00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:02.417 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Half a mile.

00:26:02.417 --> 00:26:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Half a mile?

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Bill Tompkins says that
he designed ships that were

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:90%
half to 1 mile wide.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So do you think these
are some of the designs

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that he was talking about, or
are these more advanced, even?

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The ones that I'm
familiar with were a arrowhead

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.800 align:middle line:90%
shape as well as cigar shape.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.874 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a myriad
of other small shuttle craft

00:26:27.874 --> 00:26:28.915 align:middle line:90%
depending on the mission.

00:26:28.915 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So arrowhead shape would
imply that you can fly through

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere, and they're
designing it for atmospheric

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:90%
flying as well as outer space?

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:84%
The physical properties
on the outside edges

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
also are indicative of
being able to use it

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:84%
within an atmosphere,
because they were smooth,

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.325 align:middle line:84%
and were designed so as to cut
down on the amount of friction

00:26:51.325 --> 00:26:52.125 align:middle line:90%
and resistance.

00:26:52.125 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: How about underwater?

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Could they go underwater?

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Of course.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: You can.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yep.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And are there
underwater bases here on Earth?

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It's my
understanding that there are.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: How are these the
big, giant ships powered?

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
What's the power
source for them?

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: A lot of the power
sources that we regularly used

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:84%
were a Hall-effect-type
antimatter in which

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
an antimatter particle or
particles were set in motion

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:90%
within a containment system.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And the rotation of those around
a circle would create a field.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the field would then be
capable of getting transferred

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:90%
into a conductor.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.002 align:middle line:84%
And then the conductor is
now producing electricity.

00:27:43.002 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were the
type of power systems

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that can be miniaturized
down to something

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.710 align:middle line:84%
the size of a cigarette pack,
or as large as you need to.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:84%
The Con PD gun that was the
phase-destabilizing weapon

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:84%
had its own power system,
because it was such a power

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:90%
hog.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And that system in
itself was about the size

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.140 align:middle line:90%
of a horizontal freezer.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a pretty big one.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.249 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And these aren't
nuclear powered, then,

00:28:12.249 --> 00:28:13.165 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The ones that I
am experienced with are not

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:90%
nuclear powered.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:90%
They do have them.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:84%
However, when you don't need
to mess around with something

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that's that deadly,
and you can go

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
with something that's
deadly in a different way

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't cost you as much
mass to be able to produce it.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of the subsystems,
and the safety systems,

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and the cooling systems,
all of the other things

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
that you need for a
nuclear power generator,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to have
that if you're using--

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.500 align:middle line:84%
say, for instance--
the antimatter.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: They don't
use fusion, then,

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.250 align:middle line:84%
fusion reactors at all in
the Secret Space Program?

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: One of the
reactors at the FIG base was

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:90%
a room-temperature fusion.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And so part of the power
that was used on that base

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.275 align:middle line:90%
was a pebble bed technology.

00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So they've already
achieved fusion and just

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:90%
haven't told us.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to get through
some of the fossil fuels

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Any other technologies
that you saw that are being

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:26.042 align:middle line:84%
used today on Earth by us, have
filtered their way down to us?

00:29:26.042 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Oh, there's a bunch.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.249 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah, like what?

00:29:28.249 --> 00:29:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There's a
whole bunch of them.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
The gene therapies that
you can see commonly

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is a child of some
of the programs.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Another technology, each
soldier carried a med patch kit.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And what it was is a
3-inches-wide by about

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:84%
10-feet-long roll of
second skin, if you will.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's rolled around
a spray container

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that is about the size of
an eyeglass cleaner sprayer

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:90%
bottle.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not very large.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But the whole kit comes
as one, and you cut off

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
as much of the patch that you
need, put it to the wound,

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and it sticks on it, and
then apply the spray.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And the spray component
activates the nanites

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and the genetic
modifications to the patch

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
so that it then
covers up, closes off,

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and seals burns, nicks,
punctures, bullet wounds.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
the healing, the patch

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:84%
itself has a generic
DNA as part of it.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And so what it does is--

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the nanite
enhancement therapies--

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:84%
it's supplied originally
with a generic DNA sequence.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Once it gets onto
the soldier, it

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:84%
then uses the soldier's own DNA
to replace the generic form so

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that the generic form is
no longer the baseline,

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and there's zero
chance of rejection.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And so once it replicates that
DNA sequence from the soldier,

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:84%
it's now no different
than any other part

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.850 align:middle line:84%
of the skin, or the body, or
a tissue that the soldier has.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And so these were very, very
helpful from a standpoint of,

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.530 align:middle line:84%
you've got a cut, or a
scratch, or you've been shot,

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and then you can seal it
up, seal it off, and go on

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:90%
about your business.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:84%
This type of technology is being
applied towards the second skin

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in the field of medicine
today, in which they're

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
using an analog derivative
of a second skin,

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.155 align:middle line:84%
and which they're using for
healing, for medical purposes.

00:32:03.155 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So this is
being used today?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.487 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It is starting
to come out today.

00:32:07.487 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Beginning of it, anyway.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.986 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Starting to see it.

00:32:09.986 --> 00:32:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: How about technology
that you saw that has filtered

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:90%
its way into us?

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I'd say that there
are a bunch that could be used

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The electrogravitic
drive technologies.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd sure like to
have a Buick out

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:90%
in the driveway that had that.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Having access to some of the
advanced technologies as they

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:90%
relate to replicators.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
When you just have to store
base elements in your home,

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
to go out and buy

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:84%
different products, or
materials, or components.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.040 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is stock up
on carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.170 align:middle line:84%
different base
elements, and that's

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.890 align:middle line:84%
all you need to
be concerned with.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:52.104 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:32:52.104 --> 00:32:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: The
replicator, of course,

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is the machine that makes
food, and products--

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Products and food.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the next step
in human evolution

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.630 align:middle line:84%
will be movement away from
a centralized manufacturing

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.470 align:middle line:84%
process into a decentralized
one in which people

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:13.054 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to manufacture
things within their own homes.

00:33:13.054 --> 00:33:13.853 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Sure.

00:33:13.853 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:90%
We're almost there right now.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.030 align:middle line:90%
3D printers.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.871 align:middle line:84%
