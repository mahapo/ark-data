>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:10%
we're with Ricardo
Gonzalez author

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.570 align:middle line:10%
and researcher from
Peru who has experienced

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
multiple direct contacts with
an extraterrestrial species

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:10%
called the Apunians.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Today we're talking about the
origin and destiny of souls.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ:
Thank you again, Emery.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo, so what
do you mean by the origin

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:90%
and destiny of souls?

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: This

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is a very deep and spiritual
issue, as you can imagine,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
after our extraterrestrial
contact experiences,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
many questions began
coming to mind.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And we tried to transmit
those concerns to these beings

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to see if to the best
of their ability,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
they could respond to many
different kinds of concerns.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Here on your show, we've
touched on many topics relating

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:90%
to these concerns.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But they've been
more technical issues

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
relating to accounts
to the contact itself

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:90%
with these beings.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But we also ask questions
of a more spiritual nature,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
questions about our nature,
our destiny, consciousness,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
especially because in
these beings' messages,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:84%
we were always told
that we were not just

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.470 align:middle line:84%
beings of flesh
and blood, but we

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
were, above all, a
conscious energy living

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:90%
a human experience.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So I can have some
information of my human origin

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
from an anthropological
and historical perspective.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But from a spiritual
perspective,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
if we really are a
conscious energy living

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
in a human body, what is
the origin of that energy,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
or a better question,
what is our true origin

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
because it is clear that
I am not Ricardo Gonzalez.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But I am living in a human
body, and I was baptized

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:90%
with the name of Ricardo.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I know this may sound strange
to people watching now.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But I ask you to reflect
on this for a moment.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
If we really are energy, where
were before we were on Earth?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And once the human
adventure is over,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
where are we going back to?

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I transmitted these
concerns to these beings,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and they told us a
really fascinating story.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
According to the information
from these beings,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
our universe is not just
physical as we understand it.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
There are other parallel
universes, so to speak.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
They do not have this pattern
of density as we interpret it.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And they seem not to be governed
by the space-time equation.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Just as Earth scientists
think that it all

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
originated with the
Big Bang explosion,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and in the wake of the Big Bang,
space and time, as we know it,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
appeared.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials say that
there were multiple Big Bangs

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
because we live in
reality and a multiverse.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And we, as beings of energy who
live as humans in this reality,

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
would have been born as a
kind of cosmic explosion.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
We call it an explosion
so the audience

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.940 align:middle line:90%
can understand the concept.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I would call it singularity
in more scientific terms.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that according
to these messages,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.660 align:middle line:84%
that singularity arose from
a non-physical universe

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
of large concentrations
of energies,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
of vortices in the
universe that communicate

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
with what extraterrestrials
call cosmic sources.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And from those
cosmic sources would

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
have come what we humans
call the soul or the spirit.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we try to
explore this concept further

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:90%
with the extraterrestrials.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And we asked, so how
did these sources come

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
about on the basis of what
matter or substance were

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
these lights transformed
into spirits?

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
How did they develop
their consciousness,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:90%
their individuality?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But these
extraterrestrial beings

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
told us that while we are
in this physical body,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
we would not have
enough consciousness

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:90%
to understand deeper concepts.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We come, then, from
a cosmic source

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
as if we were spirits
roaming the universe who

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
can manifest
themselves sometimes

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:90%
in the universes of matter.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to dense
matter like the structure

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of this planet called Earth
and live the human experience

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
That is the concept of the
origin of spirits or souls.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But it also has other phases:
rules, or laws in a world--

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
we'll call it spiritual--

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that seems to organize
our existence here.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Some people believe
that we make contracts

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
before we come to this
three-dimensional planet.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.038 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Yes, these beings

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:90%
have told us about it.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
We call it "the
agreement of life."

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The question is, with whom
is that agreement made?

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with what
I was trying to tell you

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:84%
just minutes ago
that there are rules

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
or circumstances in those
worlds or higher planes

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
that seem to regulate the
physical support of the roaming

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
spirit who arrives, in
this case, to the Earth.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And within those rules or
that spiritual organization,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
there are beings of non-human
consciousness who intervene.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
In some religions,
they call them angels.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
In some more
esoteric groups, they

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%
are called the lords of karma.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic circles also speak of
these beings of consciousness

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:90%
that regulate births on Earth.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Even in ancient
Egypt, these beings

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:84%
are alluded to in what we
know as Hunefer's manuscript

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:90%
or papyrus.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
In Hunefer's
manuscript, these beings

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
appear as a kind of
tribunal in the afterlife.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
this panel of entities

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
or this council of beings
of light, whatever it is,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
exists according to the
extraterrestrials' message

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and counsels with knowledge
and wisdom, the roaming soul,

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic spirit pilgrim who
will live their experience.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Then you wonder, how is it
possible for them to counsel

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
in detail at that level?

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
What makes them decide that
a cosmic soul is to be born

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
in a certain country on Earth?

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
To be born as a human being,
maybe, in the United States

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
or in my case, in Peru in South
America with different family

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
situations, cultures,
including some experiences

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that we should live throughout
the human adventure?

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
This life agreement
or legal contract

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
also appears in
different Asian beliefs,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
and some call this karma.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
However, I think it's
important to clarify

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
some concepts from the
extraterrestrial perspective,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
These hierarchies of
light that I'm mentioning

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
are based on very precise
rules in the universe of life.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And almost mathematically,
geometrically, they

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
help organize what the
future human experience

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:90%
is going to be.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
As the soul evolves and
has different experiences

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
in a world school,
every time they

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:84%
come across that
panel of light beings,

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
the higher the
consciousness, the more they

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.550 align:middle line:84%
intervene in what you
need because every action

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
or thought during
human existence

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:84%
brings a consequence
that affects timelines

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:01.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why the word
karma means action.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It is not punishment
as people in the West

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:90%
have misinterpreted.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It is a kind of law
of cause and effect.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Then, according to
the causes sowed

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
by the soul that lived on
Earth and even in other worlds

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:84%
where they may have
experienced life,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:84%
all these causes will
have consequences, effects

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:90%
on their future existences.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because you said
earlier that whoever gave us

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
the soul, how did
they know that we

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:84%
were going to be born
this day, this place,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.185 align:middle line:84%
and die in this
place at this time?

00:09:35.185 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: I

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
could explain how all this
happens with an example.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like a car
factory and excuse

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
such a mundane and
everyday example.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
There are very precise rules
for making a specific car.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is likely built for
getting around in a city.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:84%
There are other
types of cars that

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
are built to get around in rural
areas, such as a truck or Jeep.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And these possibilities
are manufactured

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
from factory designs.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Something similar happens
with our experiences

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:90%
in the world school.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
All previous information
accumulated, both by our soul

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and by other souls who
have lived in other worlds,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:90%
generates a learning pattern.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And with affinity
for a world school,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:90%
we are assigned the experience.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But experiences vary
according to the soul.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Returning to the car
example, maybe the car

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
was designed to drive on the
roads of the United States.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
It's what some would
call destiny, Emery.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:90%
But is fate set in stone?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
That car is being
driven by a driver,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and the driver represents,
in this symbolic example,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And with greater
consciousness, you

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:84%
can choose how you're going
to drive the car, at a higher

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
speed, at a lower speed,
where you're going to stop,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
or if you were going to leave
the previously determined route

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
to explore new routes that
the manufacturer did not

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:90%
warn you about.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's also an additional
detail to your question, which

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is the collective
evolution of the souls

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
because these cosmic
spirits described

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:35.780 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrials, cosmic
spirits that are actually us,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
we do not work alone in
evolution in the universe.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
We're establishing bonds,
connections with other roaming

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:90%
spirits.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is weaving a kind
of fabric of experiences

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that can generate
influence between one soul

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:90%
and another in an experience.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And it could determine how we
are sent to Earth, for example.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Put in very simple terms,
our parents or our children,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
our family are not
complete strangers to us.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
We probably chose them
before we came with all

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that that means, with that
great learning experience

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
because the journey of the
soul and its human life

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
can be full of trials and
difficult circumstances.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But the extraterrestrials
say that it

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
is good for that to
happen because we end up

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:84%
being like an
anthropologist infiltrating

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
a culture from within, being
born within it to learn

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:90%
appropriately.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Excellent, excellent.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
What or who is the origin
of this contract law,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and is there some sort of
force that's overseeing

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.717 align:middle line:90%
the erection of these souls?

00:12:53.717 --> 00:12:55.133 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: It

00:12:55.133 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
has to do with what we were
talking about a moment ago,

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:90%
my friend.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe that entities
from other planes

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
are not exactly
responsible for deciding.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:90%
But they do participate in this.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the
spiritual universe

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
were structured like this.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like asking, who
created the clouds,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:90%
or who created the wind?

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
They are reactions to the
nature that is being organized,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:90%
humidity, heat, et cetera?

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And in a higher
spiritual world, there

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect structure, Emery,
that we do not know about.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And that geometry, that
wonderful symmetrical growth

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:84%
is the basis of
this legal contract.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Remember that in
another episode,

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the
guardians of light

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
flowing in the
vortices of the Earth.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:84%
My personal opinion
of the legal contract

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
is that there would be
beings of such a nature

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:90%
but on a cosmic scale.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And these beings would be acting
so that this legal contract is

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
They are the guardians of light
of the vortices of the cosmos

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:84%
as if it were a panel or
a tribunal of Maat that

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:90%
was spoken of in ancient Egypt.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So these beings with their
knowledge, with their wisdom

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
assist the souls who
are following the laws

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:90%
of the universe to incarnate.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But those laws were not
made by these beings,

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
just like there was
no concrete entity

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:84%
or a group of
concrete beings that

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:90%
created the law of gravity.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It simply exists.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It is a mechanism of the
order in the universe.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But there are agents who step in
to explain how these laws work.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Then these beings
conveyed to us that they

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:84%
could help us understand
why we are here

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
on Earth because with
a higher consciousness,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:90%
we could have more freedom.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:90%
The law exists in and of itself.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And whomever knows the higher
laws achieves personal mastery

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and comes to understand
that human beings do not

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
have to attain a
spiritual experience,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
but we are actually spirits
living a human experience.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo, in that
case, is destiny and free will

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
something that's
controlled from the outside

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.995 align:middle line:84%
rather than controlled by
the individual themselves?

00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: I

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
believe that is the very law
of the universe that prescribes

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
things affecting the souls
who have come to Earth, first,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
individually and in more complex
scenarios, as groups of souls

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But we need to understand
the concept of free will

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:90%
within all of this.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
I think there is some confusion
when you talk about destiny

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and you talk about free will.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Destiny may be a path
you have to follow,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
which is a consequence
of cause and effect

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
of the very organization
of the universe

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that I previously explained
with the legal contract.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:84%
When you live without
feeling, like a robot,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about
in other interviews,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
you just follow that straight
line of your destiny,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:90%
of your life program.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But remember in the car example
that I gave a few moments ago,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
if the driver has
consciousness, the driver

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:90%
may choose how to steer.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And why can the driver steer?

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Because while there
is a destination,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:84%
which is the route,
then the steering wheel

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:90%
represents free will.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And it can turn right or left
according to consciousness.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.873 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a
great way to put it.

00:16:50.873 --> 00:16:52.415 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: There

00:16:52.415 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
are people who, when
they go through death,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
experience something
extraordinary.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We know this because
some people who

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
have been diagnosed
as clinically dead

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
have managed to
return to their body,

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
remaining in full consciousness,
for example, from the operating

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
room where they have lost
their lives with the doctors

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
happened there,

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time
maintaining consciousness

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
of where they were while their
body was in the hospital.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And they describe that they
encounter wonderful beams

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:84%
of light who evaluate with
them all that they have

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:90%
lived in their human existence.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The person who just
died quickly sees

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
like a screen in their
mind, if we may call it

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that, all that they did and did
not do in this human existence.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And they are counseled
by that being of light

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:90%
that appeared at that moment.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these beings
of light or whomever

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:90%
they are assume other aspects.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And they may appear as
your deceased father

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
or another person who
is important to you

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:90%
in your memory.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But an important factor
in what I'm describing,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Emery, is that people who
have gone through death

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and have managed
to return come back

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
with a greater consciousness
of the importance

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:84%
of their decisions, that
so-called free will.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They return with such a
consciousness that they say,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I would have done
things differently,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
or at least, they
have the opportunity

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
to do things differently
in the additional time that

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:90%
has been given to them.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the question
is, do you still

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
have free will in your
soul at that moment

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.493 align:middle line:84%
looking at that light and
saying, I want to go back?

00:18:33.493 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Here, we

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:84%
get entangled again
with the legal contract

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and with consciousness.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
There is no consensus on this
information among those of us

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:90%
who research these issues.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers of these
topics think that everything is

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
perfectly scripted, and we
cannot vary from that movie.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So if a person is
clinically dead

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or has a terrible accident
where they are left for dead

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and they come back from
it, all that was planned.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they have three or
four situations in which they

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
died and come back,
all that was coldly

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
calculated in their
legal contract,

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:90%
and it had to be that way.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
According to what I have
understood in my contact

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
experience, this is
not always the case.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
There may be a legal
contract, but there

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
can be some type of
clause, like blank spaces

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:90%
within that legal contract.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And within those exceptions,
act based on consciousness.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do
with your question.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
What does a person
do when they return?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Do they completely
determine this when

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.225 align:middle line:90%
they are on the other side?

00:19:54.225 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it that these
beings of light who

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:84%
intervene by controlling
life and the contract

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
tell you, OK, Emery,
you can go back

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and continue to
enjoy human life?

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I think taking into
consideration the importance

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of what you are
learning at the moment,

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
like a huge explosion
of knowledge,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%
it makes a difference.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The energy of consciousness
is so powerful

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that it may affect your
initial legal contract.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, a very powerful
force in human existence

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:90%
is love.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are cases
of mothers who

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
were thought to have passed
away from a terminal illness

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and were pronounced
dead in a hospital.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And these women met with
these beings of light

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
on the other side,
beings of light

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
who they understood to be angels
according to their beliefs, who

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
guarded a powerful
energy, a source of light

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
for her to enter into.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
soul of this mother

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
became aware of her
five-year-old daughter,

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and she felt a powerful
love, which she manifested

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
to these beings of light
or to the very light

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that she had entered
into and proposed,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to be on
Earth for a while

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.480 align:middle line:84%
longer to help
raise my daughter.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
If possible, I want
the opportunity

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:84%
to educate my daughter
and not depart now.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And that consciousness and
supreme manifestation of love

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.840 align:middle line:90%
gave her the opportunity.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, it
happens like that.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They have or we
have unfinished business,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
we say, sometimes that
we need to come back

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
and help our loved ones.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But very interesting, I
like the way you put it.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.995 align:middle line:84%
So after death, where is
everything learned and lived?

00:21:53.995 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Once we

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
finish the human experience,
all the information

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:90%
that we accumulate is not lost.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Your brain and your
heartbeat may stop.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Your body may
return to the dust.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But all the information
and all your learning

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
is turned over to that
subtle spiritual universe

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:90%
of which I spoke.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And that information
is very important

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:84%
because there are millions and
millions of us souls living

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
in different worlds, absorbing
information, experience,

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And all that sustains the
consciousness of the universe.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Death does not exist dear
Emery, and you know that.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
We only depart the physical body
when it is our turn to leave.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And everyone will
have their moment.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:84%
There are still
people on Earth who

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:84%
fear death because they
lack this knowledge.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
There are others who
are not afraid of death,

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
but they fear the way
of dying, the pain.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And others fear attachment,
which we sometimes

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
confuse with love, which are
two very different things.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
We are very deeply
rooted, anchored

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:90%
to the things of the Earth.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And when it is our turn to
embark on this great journey,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
as Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross
said, death is a dawn.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:84%
We cannot awaken at dawn if
we live tied to the past.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So after death,
nothing disappears.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And I could add something
else, my friend.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
We do not live only once.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Just as different traditions
of the world recorded,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
the human soul can incarnate
on different occasions,

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
according to the
extraterrestrials,

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:90%
in this and other worlds.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, ancient
traditions teach

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
that spirits who have reached
a deep level of consciousness

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and love overcome this
circle of reincarnations.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And they no longer
have to return to Earth

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:90%
or any other world school.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:84%
However, in very
exceptional circumstances,

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
some of these spirits
return because of love

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:90%
beyond any legal contract.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
They are outside
the legal contract.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
They return to
fulfill a mission.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:84%
In India, this
phenomenon was called

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:84%
avatar, which in Sanskrit
means the one who returns

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:90%
or the one who descends.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:90%
How is an avatar recognized?

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are
several avatars currently

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, but
their work is silent.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
In the past, we had
powerful avatars,

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
whose work was much more
public, like Buddha or Jesus.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So previous
guests have talked

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
about the suppression of
consciousness and free will

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
by outside ET
influences that keeps

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:84%
human beings from ascending
to higher consciousness.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.088 align:middle line:90%
What can you say about that?

00:25:11.088 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Well,

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.490 align:middle line:84%
as you may recall
in the episode where

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the
confrontation of forces,

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:84%
human beings are in the
middle of many influences.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is true that
one of these forces

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
does not want us to
develop our consciousness

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and reach higher
levels of evolution.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But that can only
happen if we allow it.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to say
may sound very religious.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But great masters of old
taught that we can only

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:84%
be controlled no matter how
powerful a force is if we lose

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:90%
our control, if we allow it.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I profoundly believe
this because those

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:84%
forces that other
researchers have

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
said that are trying to
crush human consciousness,

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
they also use the
existing laws to do so.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
They know they can
control us or affect us

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:84%
through fear, through
other circumstances as

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:90%
well, of course.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So a person who
stays in the middle

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and tries to keep their
consciousness awake

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be subject
to those influences.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Will we ever
be able to break away

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.735 align:middle line:90%
from these influences, Ricardo?

00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: I

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:84%
believe that with our
learning on this planet,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:84%
we will always be in the
middle of different influences.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But remember, I'm speaking
in the plural, influences.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Many times, we devote attention
to talking about an influence

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:90%
that may be negative on us.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And we forget that
there are also

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
positive influences
that try to direct us

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:90%
towards consciousness.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.155 align:middle line:84%
We are like a
sailboat, dear Emery.

00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have to let ourselves
be guided by the right winds.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a way to
be free from what

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
we would call "an unpleasant
or negative influence"

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:84%
from the temptations
of the world.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is a way, being
a disciplined person,

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
a person who does not
forget the great power that

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.960 align:middle line:90%
exists in determination.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Willpower is a wonderful
thing because willpower

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
can create incredible things
even in our physical reality.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years ago, a
great teacher said,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
what if people had faith
the size of a mustard seed?

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
They would say to
a mountain, move,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:90%
and the mountain would move.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It's almost quantum mechanics.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens in the world of
the small, of the microscopic,

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:84%
or to be more exact, in
the world of the subatomic,

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:84%
if you will, affects the
giant world around us.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And faith, willpower,
knowledge are

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.730 align:middle line:90%
powerful subatomic energies.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But they only work if you have
knowledge like the same teacher

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:90%
said 2,000 years ago.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I am going to share
a truth with you,

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and that truth
will make you free.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why there is
cosmic disclosure, right?

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It is about revealing
things that people

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
don't know because the
more knowledge you have,

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:84%
the better you can understand,
the better you can decide.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:90%
And you will be free.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:84%
We are therefore souls
more than human beings

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:90%
of flesh and blood.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And we are all living
this play together.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:90%
We are inside a character.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But when the play that
we are acting in is over,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
we take off our
makeup and costume,

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and we go home because that
is who we are, pure light.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have come here
to be free and happy.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well put, Ricardo.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:90%
That was so beautiful.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you again
for being on the show.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Thank
you, my friend.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:29:45.052 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Shambhala

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is the name of a supposed
lost city in Asia that

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
speaks of beings who
came from heaven,

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:84%
great minds who trained ancient
humans in spiritual knowledge.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:84%
When I've been in the Gobi
Desert with the lamas,

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:84%
he said to us the
people who walk

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, who move
in those lights,

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:84%
protect the entrance to
the subterranean world.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:84%
There are many things
that have happened

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that unite the myth of Shambhala
and the extraterrestrials.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Shambhala means
the place of peace,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the place of tranquility, so
find your inner Shambhala.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:90%
