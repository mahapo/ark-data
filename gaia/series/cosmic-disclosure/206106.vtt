00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.410 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
his work with DARPA.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.295 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.077 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick you've done
a lot of work with DARPA.

00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's first tell the
audience what is DARPA.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: DARPA is the Defense
Advanced Project Research

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a organization attached
to the Department of Defense.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Their mission is to develop
and monitor and coordinate

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
advanced research
for military use.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It's primarily for the military.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they do,
99% of their projects

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:84%
are for the
Department of Defense

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.245 align:middle line:90%
and military applications.

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why were
you part of that?

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
What was your
project with DARPA?

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I
wasn't actually--

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I never worked with DARPA but
I was working for the institute

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:90%
but I was connected to DARPA.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
We were coordinating things
between the institute

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and what DARPA was doing.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The institute had a
contract with DARPA

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:90%
to analyze exotic technology.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, never heard a DARPA
person say ET technology.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:90%
It was always exotic technology.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
particular section

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:90%
called exotic technology.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Because DARPA concentrated
on coordinating the research,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
dishing out the money
to different companies

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:90%
to do the research forum.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
DARPA had about 250
employees but they

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
had like 50 or 60
contract companies

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle line:90%
that were working for them.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So they would
contract the company

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
under a defense contract,
a DOD security contract,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
meaning the company had
to have cleared people

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to do all their work and they
would analyze the project

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:90%
and then report back to DARPA.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
The primary mission
of DARPA was any kind

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:84%
of exotic technology
or foreign technology,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to reverse engineer.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
How easy was it for
the United States

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to reverse engineer
this widget that they

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:90%
got from some other place?

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
We want to make a widget
better than that widget,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
but we can't determine
what that widget's

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
made of so we have to
find some other materials,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
some other elements to construct
that widget so it would operate

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:90%
just like this one.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what they were doing

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
probably doing today.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, I
find it fascinating.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you brought it
up that DARPA has hundreds

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
of other corporations that
they contract certain workout

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
to test exotic materials to
keep it compartmentalized.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So not everyone knows
what's going on.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with that?

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I absolutely
agree with it.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was
out at Area 51,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
DARPA had a big office out there
but they didn't do a whole lot.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:84%
They were coordinating the other
agencies, such as Raytheon,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Motorola, E-System,
Los Alamos and Sandia

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Laboratories, among many,
many other companies that

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:84%
were building something,
and contributed

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
to the reverse
engineering of something.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, DARPA would never
say ET-related, but secretly

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
speaking, if you spoke to one
of the project coordinators,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
DARPA project
coordinators, he would use

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:90%
or they would use the word ET.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:84%
We found this ET device,
and now we want to--

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
but in a practical term
or in an open term,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
they're going to use
exotic technology.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.563 align:middle line:84%
But when you confront them
with what is exotic technology,

00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to
give you an answer.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
work obviously is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
foreign technology, things that
we're getting from the Soviet

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Union back then or Russia now or
China or some other countries.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Because most countries,
most civilized countries

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.780 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of
research project going on,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
keep on top of it.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
that branch of DARPA

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that is creating
something on their own.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they want a company to
make the best laser or the best

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
other widget that we can
use in an application

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:90%
to advance military technology.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So let's say, for
instance, Air Force, Army,

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Navy, Marines finds
some exotic technology,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
do they get to keep it or
does it go to you or DARPA?

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, back in my
days, there was a standing

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
instruction for other services
that if it was a flying device,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
if something flew,
an exotic technology,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
a UAP or UFO that crashed, the
Air Force would have primary

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for the recovery
and analysis of that craft.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, did that always happen?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure not, I'm
sure some occasions

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
the Navy found
something out at sea.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I know of a case, I
know of a very, very--

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
was at one time classified
incident about a Navy ship,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
a carrier group
that saw something

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:90%
crashed into the ocean.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.615 align:middle line:84%
They went out there,
it took them--

00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And retrieved it?

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: And they retrieved it.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Took them days and
days to retrieve it,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and here it is, sitting
on the enterprise

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
because the enterprise was
the aircraft carrier that

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:90%
was in the carrier group.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
They brought it up on
some kind of a ship

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.223 align:middle line:90%
that they used to bring it up.

00:06:10.223 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was sitting on a
deck and there was pictures,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and there was one on
the internet some years

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
ago about this flying saucer
sitting on a deck of the USS

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
enterprise.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And that thing ended up--

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
the Navy kept it for a long
time before they eventually

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
had to turn it over
to the Air Force.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And that craft
ended up at Area 51.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you share with
us any exotic technologies

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
or materials that you guys had
that you actually shared with

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:90%
DARPA?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I was fortunate
enough to witness a testing

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
of something that was recovered
in a UFO crash in 1969.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
It was a large
softball size object.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
It had very, very,
very strange powers.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It was brought to the
institute to examine

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:90%
as it was with other places.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:90%
I believe it went to--

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
because it was recovered
in 1969 and we didn't

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:90%
get into like 1999 or '98.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So it went through a
lot of different labs

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
but nobody could understand it.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could understand
what it was used for

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:90%
or how it operated.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
They knew, number one, if you
put it in a sub-zero cooler,

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:90%
it would heat up.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
If you took it and put it in
a furnace, it would cool down.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be damaged.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It was emitting
strange radio signals

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
in various wavelengths,
the radio spectrum,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't understand
if those signals were--

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
they were using those
signals to function

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
or if this object was using
the signal to function

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
or if the signals were coming
in to it from an outside source

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
or whether this
object was sending out

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
this signal to some
other location.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:90%
But it would open up.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The middle portion of this
ball would be flexible.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%
It was a silver colored ball.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
If you looked at it, it looked
like just a silver ball.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:90%
It was heavy.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it weighed something
like 6 or 8 pounds.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But when you set it down,
it was operating on its own,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:90%
it would open up.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
You never saw the creases in it
so nobody knew how it worked.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:84%
There was no power source that
they could determine inside.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
They used all sorts of different
methods of looking into it;

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
X-ray, and I'm sure,
electro-microscopes.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just guessing, I'm
not sure how they did it,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
but they were trying to
look into it to determine

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
whether they had
batteries, if there

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.770 align:middle line:84%
was some other electrical
system that was

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:90%
using the outside atmosphere.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the scientists
thought there was something

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that we were experimenting with
where we could extract hydrogen

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
from the atmosphere and make
it into some kind of a battery.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know the whole
technique involved in that.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But they thought maybe that
was what was occurring.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But then again, the scientists
at the end of the day,

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.745 align:middle line:84%
he said, we're thinking in
our terms, our education

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and what we would
learn years and how

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:84%
we were trying to apply our
technology to this ball.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And this ball wasn't
made on Earth,

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
it was made with
alien technology,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to
understand what it is.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we don't
know how it functions.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And number two, we don't
even know what it's used for.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
It was found in a craft
in 1969 in Nevada,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what-- we don't
know what it's used for.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
We know it does
all these things.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Does it control something?

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it a control mechanism?

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Because the craft isn't there.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't have the craft there.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And one of the scientists,
very smart person

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
who's still operating
today at Los Alamos,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
says you know what, we have to
make this ball with the craft.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe we'll
figure it all out.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether they
actually did it

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
because I was only there
for experiments over,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I think, five or six days.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
how long it was.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:90%
A week at the most.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And watching all
this being done.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sitting in
the back watching this.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.713 align:middle line:84%
And consensus was we're
going to have to get a hold--

00:10:50.713 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
DARPA reps were there-- we're
going to have to get a hold,

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
take it out to wherever the
craft is probably, Area 51,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and mate this with that craft.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the '90s.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll figure
out what to do.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And whether they did
that, I never heard.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they probably did
but I was never privy to that.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.785 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what's the name
of this 1969 crash in Nevada?

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, it was
one I never heard of.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:84%
There was a crash site
near Hawthorne, Nevada.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a, I
believe, army base there.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Hawthorne Army Depot or
something to that effect.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was not far from
Fallon Naval Air Station, too.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:90%
That's out that way.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's in Western,
Northwestern Nevada.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was recovered, and
I didn't know much about it

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
because when the DARPA people
and the other people that

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:84%
were there start
talking about this,

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
they're mentioning Hawthorne and
all my years in intelligence,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
the 10 years that I worked
with UFO events and incidents,

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I never heard about this case.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So all I knew was there was
a crash site near Hawthorne.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:90%
They recovered the craft.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
They found this ball, power
device, or whatever it was.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And now, over the years--

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
now, you figure, 1969 to
where we were, 20 years later,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.025 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know what it is.

00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
They still don't
know what it is.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They still haven't
determined what materials

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
it's made out of
or how it operates?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.172 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: No, no.

00:12:24.172 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's been
20 years since,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:90%
maybe they have since that time.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't privy to that.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What other
objects were examined?

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: There was a cylinder
that had been recovered,

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.330 align:middle line:84%
18 inches long, a metal,
hard metal cylinder,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
had a little moving
piece inside of it.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, we were
allowed to look at it,

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.138 align:middle line:84%
try to determine what we
thought it might be used for.

00:12:53.138 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
a lot of consensus

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that had brought along with it,
that maybe a translator, maybe

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a weapon
system, maybe a stun gun,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.485 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of different
possibilities.

00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Where did
you obtain it from?

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Somebody
brought it into the lab.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Somebody brought it in and
said, figure out what this is.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know--

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.685 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the knowledge
of where this came from

00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
or how long we had,
the government had it.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
But we spent a lot of time, the
lab, the scientists, not me,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
but they spent a
lot of time trying

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what these things
were that was given back.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I was on a small plane.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
We flew back to
Los Alamos with it.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And we had to spend
a night in Los Alamos

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
but we turned it
over to the people

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
at Los Alamos, not the
Air Force Scientific

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.985 align:middle line:84%
Laboratory but another
section of Los Alamos.

00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, they just
shrugged their shoulders,

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:90%
said, we don't know what it is.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
We'll put it away on the
shelf and five years from now,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
we'll bring it back out,
maybe our technology

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.408 align:middle line:84%
will have advanced far enough
to understand what it is.

00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they didn't have--
they couldn't find any unique

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
characteristics about
it or a uniqueness?

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It was just something that we
received it, we don't know,

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:90%
we shelved it.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, it put out
frequencies just like the other

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
devices, had seemed to
have a mind of its own.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It functioned by powering itself
up and powering itself down

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
without any outside influence,
no manipulation on our part.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And the puzzle is, we had good
batteries, some good batteries

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:90%
back in those days.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't have anything that
could keep it charged for as

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.377 align:middle line:90%
long as these things did.

00:14:41.377 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't understand it.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't understand how
it would generate frequencies.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, we could generate
frequencies by frequency

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:84%
generator or building a
radio or something like that.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't understand
how this thing could create

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, that they
could track the frequencies,

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and they could measure
the frequencies.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
We could, but they couldn't
determine what was generated.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And that when you give
something to a scientist

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and they can't understand
it, they get very upset.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, we should be
able to understand this,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:84%
we should be able
to figure that out.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.770 align:middle line:84%
But our technology
hasn't advanced.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, sometimes they
have to be humble about it

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes we wouldn't
understand it, you know,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
until that technology-- we get
up to that consciousness level

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and that technology level just
like when forensic sciences

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
with murder victims, you
know, it takes sometimes 20,

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
30 years to find out
who really did it.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I see that a lot with artifacts
of extraterrestrial origin.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, DARPA purchased an artifact
from a rancher in South Dakota.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
This was an energy
device reportedly.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, well, I'm not
sure if it's DARPA that--

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it was probably DARPA's
money but another company

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.237 align:middle line:90%
actually--

00:16:05.237 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Funded it?

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: --funded it.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was sent to
the lab and they found

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:90%
some unique characteristics.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this thing has been--

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:84%
we don't know when it was
manufactured obviously

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:84%
but it was sitting in a
rancher's house for 20

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:90%
some years.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:90%
And now, it still functions.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
They analyzed it to
determine that there

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%
was frequencies involved.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.990 align:middle line:84%
They used it to power different
devices in the laboratory.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Something from a
small pen light to--

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had an
elaborate setup in the lab

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure
exactly what voltage

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:84%
they were needing but the
voltage was this thing,

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
the small device was
able to power these

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and provide a proper
voltage, amperage, voltage,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:84%
wattage to power up
different devices,

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
different lighting
systems, power generator.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
It was able to power generator
for a long period of time.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:84%
They even went out
and started a car

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:84%
without disconnecting
the battery.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:84%
They had to manipulate in
order to get the connectors

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:90%
on this energy device.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do they even know
that it was an energy device

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:90%
to begin with?

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, in 1947, they
found a Plexiglas device

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Corona crash where
they thought it was a window.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And this thing was placed-- this
is a very interesting story.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:84%
They placed it on a
shelf because they

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
thought it was just a window
because it's like Plexiglas.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, people
at Los Alamos, scientists

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
at Los Alamos would
bring it out and they

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
would try to look into it to see
what kind of glass was made of

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:90%
or Plexiglas or material.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And when one of the
scientists was looking at it,

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
they saw something
moving inside.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was stunned
and then they started

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.240 align:middle line:84%
doing some really
advanced research on this.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this was in
the '60s so there wasn't a lot

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
of advancement but they
determined that there was

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.228 align:middle line:84%
something moving inside
this like little bubbles--

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like a
spark or bubble or--

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Little bubbles.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
They were chambers,
little chambers.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:84%
But the best microscope
they could get,

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
they could just find
these little chambers

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and there was something
moving around.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure out what
it was moving around or why,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and of course, they didn't
know what it was used for.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Then later on in the '70s,
some very, very smart people

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:84%
figured there has to be
an application for this.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So they tried all sorts
of different things.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Putting lights through
it, lasers through

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:90%
it, all sorts of things.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And some scientists
actually connected something

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
to the one area
and he said, maybe

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
it would generate electricity.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And bingo, and they found
it to be the general device.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And that went to a lot of
different laboratories,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and that's why the Institute
for Advanced Studies

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
was analyzing to
determine whether it was--

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and a theory was that it
was zero point energy that

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
was causing this thing to
produce the energy that it

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:90%
could operate, function with.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: After finding out
all this information, you know,

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
what did they do with
that information?

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And did anyone benefit from it?

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I don't know that
they ever fully understood how

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:90%
the energy device functioned.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:90%
They knew it functioned.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.700 align:middle line:90%
They knew it did these things.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things they
did was they got companies

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to try to duplicate it,
not using alien technology,

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
obviously, but materials
we have here on Earth.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Can we duplicate this energy
device with the materials

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:90%
that we have on Earth?

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.243 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're still
trying to do it today.

00:19:56.243 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was there anything
else at DARPA that you'd like

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
to share with us that
you were privy to?

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, there's a lot
of things that I had access

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:90%
to, not necessarily--

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
not working with DARPA, I
never did work with DARPA,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
but knowing what DARPA was doing
from an outside agency looking

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:84%
into DARPA and having interface
with a lot of different DARPA

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
they were doing,

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:84%
which was very,
very, very prominent,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:84%
spending a lot of money,
and I'm sure where

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
the money was coming
from, the government,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:90%
but it was government money.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
They were paying
companies to try

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:90%
to duplicate exotic technology.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:84%
That was a big, big, big
factor in their existence.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And some companies,
particularly Motorola

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
because I had a good friend
who worked with Motorola,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't tell
Motorola everything.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
In Motorola, the first
thing is, OK, we're

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:84%
going to try to duplicate
this thing that sends out

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:90%
these signals but what is it?

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:90%
We can't tell you that.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Just try to duplicate it.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So they'd go through,
and Motorola experts

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:84%
in communications, and they'd
figure out all the frequencies

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, well, this
frequency, we use for this.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
These frequencies are
so exotic we don't ever

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:90%
use these frequencies.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
They would be satellite
frequencies or something.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know, or microwave
frequencies or something.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
say, well, we can

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
generate these frequencies
but what do you

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.048 align:middle line:90%
want them to use for?

00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, DARPA don't even
know what these things are

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
used for so how can
he tell Motorola

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
or any other companies, this
is what we want you to do.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And so these companies
would get these contracts,

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen it, and
work on these things,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:50.590 align:middle line:84%
trying to duplicate it using
our technology, our elements.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
were successful

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
but they could never duplicate
the exotic technology.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely perfect.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Because these things
that we try to make

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.715 align:middle line:84%
didn't work very well, and
not as well as this thing did.

00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And we don't have
those materials here probably

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.678 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, and we
don't have the materials,

00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
the elements that they sometimes
determined that were in these.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
A mixture of bismuth and
zinc or some other things

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that something connected to
iron that was lightweight.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, things-- and I'm
not a technician so I don't--

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.935 align:middle line:84%
I can't talk about
everything that they

00:22:26.935 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:84%
were-- explain everything
that we're talking about.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But they had a lot of
questions, a lot more questions

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:90%
than answers.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So after personally
interacting with these

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:84%
artifacts and all the intel and
information that gained from

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
this, and that all this
stuff originated off planet,

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:90%
how does that affect you today?

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I just wished
I was a scientist.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I wish I was a physicist.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I was fully
educated in that arena

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:84%
to understand what the
importance of these objects

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
were or could be
to our technology,

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and how we could apply them.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there
looking at these things

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:84%
not understanding any
of it, and I'm still

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out how could these

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:90%
work to better our technology.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure it could happen.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we could figure these
objects, these devices out,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there was an
application in our technology

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that we could use to better
it, to make a cleaner,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe cleaner energy which
is really prominent out there

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:90%
now, less fossil fuels.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I just wish that we
could understand them

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:84%
or that the ETs would
bring us something

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.750 align:middle line:84%
that we could understand,
that we could use,

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't harming
the environment.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you miss working
in these clandestine ET-related

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:90%
missions?

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes, I do.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't have access to
anything anymore very much.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I still connect with
certain intelligence officers

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and they throw me a few
tidbits here and there.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it's--

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:90%
I miss it.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think any
of the three letter agencies

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
or the military currently work
with extraterrestrial beings

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: I'm pretty positive.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
firsthand knowledge.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I never saw anything
classified that stated this.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But there are people
that will come forth

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:90%
that worked out of Area 51.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It said that we had somebody
assisting us in EBA 2 or EBA 3,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:90%
or the person called J-Rod.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It was an extraterrestrial
entity that provided knowledge

00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
on trying to understand the
captured spacecrafts that we

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:84%
had and try to
reverse engineer them.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In your years of
working in these projects,

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
have you seen any of that
technology come forth

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:90%
in the civilian world?

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yes, I think not
necessarily what I saw--

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what the Institute
did is their business.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't work
for them anymore.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
proprietary stuff

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that I can't talk about,
that I saw that probably

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:90%
would answer those questions.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But there are things out
there, especially the things

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that we go back to Philip Corso,
Colonel Corso talked about.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
technology that we

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
were at in the 1950s, '60s,
and look at the technologies

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:90%
that we're here today.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Somebody, I think, assisted
us advancing our technology.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And I believe it was the ETs.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is my own
personal knowledge.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a personal statement.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything I've learned
during my intelligence career.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that I saw
during my intelligence career

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and connect it to
my life right now.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can't help but believe
that ET technology has

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:90%
helped advanced our technology.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Now, I agree, Rich.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:84%
With your experience
in DARPA, do you

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
see a future with
disclosure and when

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.225 align:middle line:90%
do you think that might be?

00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, that's a
complicated question for me

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
because I knew how
the military operates.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
secrets they keep

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and what the military did back
from the '70s to the '80s.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't involved with them.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I know the military knew the
subject, knew what happened

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
in the past, had all
that technology, all

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that information but they
wouldn't share it then.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, to get that
out of the military

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and to get that out of
the intelligence community

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and bring it forth to the
American or the world public

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is going to be quite
a pull, so to speak.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I think there's going to
be some sort of disclosure.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot of people
working on the disclosure.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:10%
A great person that I
met once, Harry Reid, he

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:10%
was a great Senator from Nevada,
he tried many, many times.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But even though he's
a Majority Leader

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:84%
at one time at the United
States Senate, as a Democrat,

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:90%
he wasn't able to pull much out.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:90%
He knew something was there.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:10%
John McCain was another one.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:10%
John McCain tried.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:10%
He had been briefed into
the subject many years ago.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And he knew of some things
that he tried to bring forth.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can go all the way
back to Barry Goldwater.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:10%
And Barry Goldwater was
an Air Force general

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:10%
and he was also a senator.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:90%
He ran for president.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:90%
He knew a lot.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:90%
He'd been briefed into it.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
He tried to go public
with information

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and they shut him down.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the
military operates.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:84%
To get this information
out to the public

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to be trying to
pull a rabid dog's tooth.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Quite the
undertaking, indeed.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In all your
experiences that you've been

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:21.190 align:middle line:84%
through in the covert
world, what's your take?

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And do you believe
that we have an SSP

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.770 align:middle line:90%
program that's been going on?

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I knew of
a secret space program

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
but the only information I had
access to was that we had deep

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:90%
space probes.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We had launched just probes out
of the shuttle to deep space

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
to watch for comets
and asteroids

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and to keep watch on our solar
system for possible invasion.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.080 align:middle line:10%
And that's what President
Reagan was briefed on.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.050 align:middle line:10%
And that's why the Strategic
Defense Initiative was

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:59.460 align:middle line:10%
activated and tried to
get put into the system

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:10%
because we were afraid,
we knew of hostile intent

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:10%
by extraterrestrial races.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And the best defense
is a distant defense.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
The more distant you can
track something coming,

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:84%
the better you're going
to be prepared for it.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And I knew of that.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as us
having the ability

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to fly to another
planet and fight

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
a war with another race
of extraterrestrials,

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I was never briefed
into that program

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
while I was in the
intelligence community.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
However, since I've
been out on the outside,

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot
more, especially

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:84%
from some very senior
intelligence people,

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
some retired now who told me
that it actually does exist.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Isn't that
odd once we get out

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:84%
of the compartmentalized
programs,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:84%
we learn more than we did when
we were in because we were

00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.947 align:middle line:90%
compartmentalized?

00:29:59.947 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It's right.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We were structured,
we were disciplined

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to stick with the
compartmentalization

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:90%
that you sign the oath for.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And before-- just an example,
when I worked at Area 51,

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.580 align:middle line:84%
there was four OSI agents
there and a supervisor.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:84%
None of us knew what
each one was doing.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that this-- isn't people--

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
when I tell a layperson
that, they don't believe me.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's how
compartmentalization works.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:90%
And just like the FOIA system.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:84%
The FOIA system works
in so much the opposite.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
If the government doesn't
want you to have something

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that you requested during FOIA,
you're not going to get it.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.160 align:middle line:84%
The people, the lay
people on the outside

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:84%
think that if they
submit a FOIA request,

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:90%
oh they're going to get it.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't get
it, it doesn't exist.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:90%
You're lying.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I sent a FOIA
request in and then

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:00.830 align:middle line:84%
you explain to them what Title
V United States code really

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.530 align:middle line:84%
means, that's the
FOIA, is that they can

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:90%
withdraw anything they want to.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
the United States Code

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that says they have
to give you anything.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:84%
They will look at
their requests.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is if
you're in a secretive office,

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.865 align:middle line:84%
you get the request, you got
an administrator up front,

00:31:19.865 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm the guy with the knowledge,
you're going to come back to me

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:90%
and say, is there anything here?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.868 align:middle line:90%
Nope, there's nothing there.

00:31:25.868 --> 00:31:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going
to go up and send

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:84%
a letter off telling
the requester,

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:90%
no, we don't have anything.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Or they're going to
come back and say,

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
we can't acknowledge the
existence or nonexistence

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.672 align:middle line:84%
of whatever you're asking for
or it's properly classified.

00:31:41.672 --> 00:31:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Which you've
been through personally.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I've been through
personally, many times.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: With the high
technology of DARPA,

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
some people are suggesting a
false flag extraterrestrial,

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:90%
quote unquote, alien invasion.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Well, I've heard that.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.405 align:middle line:84%
I think that some
of it might be true

00:32:02.405 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:90%
of my own personal opinion.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:08.840 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot more to that.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a paper written some
years ago in the Pentagon.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, back
during the Cold War era,

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that talked about
that, that talked

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:90%
about what if we could do this?

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Or what if we could do that?

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Talking about a
false flag invasion.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Or what the derivative
that was, what

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:84%
if we were confronted
by what we thought

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:44.040 align:middle line:84%
were the Russians or the
Soviets but were actually ETs?

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Or vice versa, what if we
are attacked by the ETs

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.620 align:middle line:84%
but they were really
posing as a Russians?

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:90%
How would we handle all this?

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
war plans, there

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
were plans created
to counter all this.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Pentagon writes
plans for everything.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Alien invasions, you
name it, and they
