00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by
Victoria Whitney,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.600 align:middle line:10%
a Doctor of Science and a
retired member of the United

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
States Navy,
Department of Defense.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:10%
She has worked as an
environmental engineer

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:10%
and scientist in special
programs and projects,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:10%
and is an expert in
extraterrestrial and crash site

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:10%
investigations.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're discussing
the law and what's coming.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome to the show.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA WHITNEY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: From all your
extraterrestrial contacts,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:84%
were there any core or
fundamental beliefs that were

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
commonly shared amongst the
various species, and by whom?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Sure.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a big subject.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: So,
amongst all of them,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:90%
the common theme is energy.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Energy.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.243 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Energy.

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you talk about,
the basis of their conversation

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:90%
is about energy.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
They can't speak to
biology, science, anything

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
without saying that energy
is involved in that.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they never have
a conflict with that subject.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: So they don't have
a conflict with that subject

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
The conflict they have
is who has more energy.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's always
some ego going on--

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Indeed.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.963 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --even in space.

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And so it was
interesting to understand that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that's the number
1 core premise,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:90%
is that everything is energy.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they're
capable of doing anything.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
They also have a core
premise about lineage.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Lineage is so important to them.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
They trace their lineage back
as far as they can trace it.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
They say that they're
the original star seeds.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there a little bit
of animosity back going saying,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:90%
hey, we're a bit older than you?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Well, it's
funny because the Arcturians,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:84%
when they start into
a lead sentence,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.576 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
Orions, they'll say, well,

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
you know we're much
older than you.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know if that's
to put them in their place

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
or whether that's to
convey we have more wisdom.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure which it is
because while they don't react

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
to things, there's usually
a little bit of banter

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:90%
back and forth on that.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
very important to them.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It is about the knowledge.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that, the
Arcturians are saying,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
we've been around far
longer, therefore, we

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:90%
have more knowledge.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:90%
You can learn from us too.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Do they share it
straight across?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:90%
No, you got to work for it.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's interesting.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That is
funny, actually.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: It is.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So while we say we
have a lot of emotions

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and they don't, I believe
that's one way in which they

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
do show some emotion, is
that you have to work for it.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just going
to give it to you.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I've seen that happen
more than once with them.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It looks like
logic has replaced emotion.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm logically
better than you

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.508 align:middle line:90%
because I have more knowledge.

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: That's an
interesting word too

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
because they will take
critical thinking over logic.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And
for a lot of people,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:84%
they can't distinguish
between the two.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
They say, we will
critically think something

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.148 align:middle line:84%
through before we will
apply logic to it.

00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:22.315 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's facinating.

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And so I think
that that's where we should be.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of
the core things,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:90%
is looking at that lineage.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%
It's very important to them.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the way in which they see.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
the frequency now.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
All those lineages
have a frequency,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and so that's what
they're identifying as by.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
We tell people, find out
what your cosmic identity is.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
You can go to our
website, we'll show you

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
how to do that because that's
the way in which they're

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
seeing us, is by our cosmic
identity, our origination

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're
looking at their map

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:84%
or they're getting
to know people,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:90%
it is by that cosmic identity.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So we are some of the
youngest ones out here right

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Yes,
we're the babies.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: We're the babies.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Right.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But what I find
interesting is, they say,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
our law is based on
the 42 universal laws.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And we've had a discussion
about that before.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But the number 1 law
is the law of one.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
That you have
unconditional love,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
you serve others, and that you
live by the eternal truths,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.432 align:middle line:90%
which are the universal laws.

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
They look at it and
they say, how can you

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:90%
ask for anything more?

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
talking about really

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
is this thing that is our core
being, that spiritual, higher

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:90%
self that lives within us.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And that that's the thing
that should be living

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:90%
to these other qualities.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So really, we can come up with
a lot of different answers,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
but if we just stick
to what they know,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:90%
this is tried and true.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where they've been
for millions of years.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.585 align:middle line:84%
Our evolution would
be much better.

00:04:56.585 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Off the camera, we
talked about the great chain

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you tell
us about that?

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Sure.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
This is another core
premise that they have,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
really, that we all belong
to that chain of life,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that we all have evolutions that
we're supposed to go through.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:90%
We all have lessons to learn.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
We all should be coming
a higher state of being.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
These are the core principles
of that great chain

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:90%
of life, and that it's cyclical.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:84%
It comes and goes with
the other cycles that

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:90%
are occurring in the universe.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they really think that
that's an important thing

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And some people, they feel
are, we'll not say people,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:90%
we'll say beings.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Some beings abuse
that chain of life

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
by creating dominance
over other beings.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And they want us to understand
that as that chain of life,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:90%
we should be free.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
That that's what
we're meant to be.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.100 align:middle line:84%
We were created to expand
the knowledge of the source.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't do that
if you're not operating

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:90%
as the unit of source.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And so this great
chain of life really

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is about us being able to
come together and become

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
part of that living,
breathing source.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The
intelligence of energy,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
how does that shape the
understanding of our universe?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Well, in their core
memories of how things work,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
they believe that source
is an intelligent energy.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:90%
That it self-realized.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.448 align:middle line:84%
And in self-realizing,
it decided--

00:06:25.448 --> 00:06:26.656 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: You mean conscious?

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:27.906 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Conscious, right.

00:06:27.906 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And it self-realized and
became aware of itself.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And as it became more
aware, it determined that it

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:90%
could create another awareness.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that began
the creative process.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And it is through
that learning--

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:84%
so if something is
created, that must go on,

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
it becomes part of
that chain of life.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It has to become aware
and on to the next.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how they see
the universe as developing.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's a couple of times
where they've pointed out,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:90%
look at this nebula.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happening, is
that it's becoming self-aware.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a wonderful thing.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I would have never looked
at it like that before.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But after I thought
about it, I thought, wow,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
if I was becoming self-aware,
I would see all those colors

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and things because I would
have no context with which

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
to put it in.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought that
was a wonderful thing

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
to be able to point
to that and say

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a self-awareness
happening,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and that eventually it will
evolve to something else

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:90%
through that self-awareness.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It will begin to create
new planets and new systems

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So what a wonderful way to
think that not only is it

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:84%
happening inside us, but we can
see it all around us in nature

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and in the cosmos.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.298 align:middle line:84%
And so when they pointed that
out, it was just like, wow.

00:07:47.298 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's right
there this whole time.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.752 align:middle line:90%
And I'm part of that.

00:07:52.752 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I just took
that away as saying

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
what a great moment
to understand how

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:90%
we fit in the scheme of things.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So it is that self-awareness
that this intelligent energy

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:90%
is having.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But it also has to
go through a process

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
where they say it needs
to continue to learn.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And it learns from
its creations.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
teachings that we have

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
experiences for a reason.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
We need to recognize
the influence

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:90%
that experience has upon us.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So we need to take
something away from it.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully it's
something positive so

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that we can become more aware
and change our perception.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's the
same thing that they're

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
relaying is that that source has
to go through the same thing,

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
through its creations, is to be
able to experience and then keep

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.433 align:middle line:90%
the creative energies flowing.

00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a wonderful
way to look at it.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's how
it's evolving then.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Yes, right.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's an evolutionary process
that's occurring every moment.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is
cosmic identity?

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Cosmic
identity, OK.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how do
they understand that?

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.615 align:middle line:90%
How do they recognize this?

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: So they recognize
it as your original energy.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And your original energy
from the time it was created

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is around to become many,
many different things.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And so your original
energy is who you're

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
going to be no matter what.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
That's how they identify
us is by these tribes.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's 20 tribes that
are the original tribes.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they are identifying with
one of those of the 20 tribes.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is by your energy, not
by your lineage at that point.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:90%
So you had an original energy.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:90%
This is the way they see you.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It has everything to
do with your frequency.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to look
for a specific being,

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:84%
it is by that energy
that they look.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
They don't see this vehicle.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No way.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And so it's
very important for everybody

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
to understand their
cosmic identity.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.513 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people
throughout the years,

00:09:53.513 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
like I say, I've been
doing this for 60 years,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that they find their
cosmic identity.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And the more they get to
know about their energy,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:84%
the more they realize
this is who I really am.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the facade
that I created.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:90%
This is who I really am.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And it allows them to get
down to a better level

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:90%
and become a better being.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very
important that because that's

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
the way they believe,
we should also

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
continue to understand
that and believe as well.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how does one learn
about their cosmic identity?

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Sure.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:90%
We have a website.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
put it in the search,

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.205 align:middle line:84%
just put in Omicron
Commonwealth Extraterrestrial.

00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:10%
It will come to the top.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, it's
omicroncommonwealth.com.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:10%
And if you go in there,
there'll be a tab

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:10%
that says Cosmic Identity.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It'll show you how to
find your cosmic identity.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
figure out what that is,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.590 align:middle line:84%
there are four buttons that
have red, yellow white tabs--

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.715 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What's out there.

00:10:50.715 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: --and you click
on the one that is yours.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you look up your
kin, which you're a sun,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm a warrior, that's our
kin, and it'll tell you

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
what your harmonic is,
your harmonic tone,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you can read
about what your traits are.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a
bit of information

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that we put out there so
that you can follow and get

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.517 align:middle line:90%
to learn how your energy works.

00:11:12.517 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Excellent.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So how commonly shared
is this perspective

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:90%
amongst the other ET races?

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Are there some ET
races that don't

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.512 align:middle line:84%
look for this cosmic identity
or don't believe in it?

00:11:24.512 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: So I think
they all believe in it.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the way in
which they believe in source.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So I've had many
conversations where

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
they say, yes, the
Draconians believe in source.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
However, the source in the
way in which they believe

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
They believe that everything
source handed down

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:84%
was meant for them, not
for the rest of the races.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting,
the perspective

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:90%
that they've taken on that.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas you have other
civilizations that are saying,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:84%
no, it's for the benefit of
all races that were created.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So there is that split with
some of the races where

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
they believe that, OK,
source gave me this gift,

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:90%
therefore it's mine.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sharing it with anybody.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you have those that
it's meant to benefit everybody.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:90%
We are not alone.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And most of the ones
that we have dealt with,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I would consider to be
a benevolent species.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
that are malevolent,

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and I've come across
a couple of those.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to do that.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But they also
believe that they're

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:84%
entitled to something because
that's the way they see source.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: The Dracos really
think that they are supposed

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.465 align:middle line:10%
to be gifted everything, from
the best health to owning

00:12:35.465 --> 00:12:36.265 align:middle line:10%
everything.

00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Right.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
change their mind because it's

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:90%
so ingrained in them.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It is.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And I know they do
a lot of genetic manipulation,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and they have some species
that they've developed within

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
their own race that are terrible
for whatever purpose that is.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:84%
They believe that this third
dimension belongs to them,

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:90%
that it is their empire.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And so in saying
that, obviously, we

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
have not come up
against something

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:90%
like that on this planet before.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we should be aware
that that exists out there.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Whatever current wars
they're having right

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
now happen to involve
the Draconians.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure exactly
when it happened,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
but they make mention that they
have allied with the serpents,

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and we knew them in
our history as Nagas.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So apparently,
that's made things

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
worse because they too have
a mentality that everything

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:90%
belongs to them.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So, now you have
two species that

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:84%
are willing to war against other
species that have a mentality

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:90%
that everything belongs to them.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:90%
That we are entitled to nothing.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
We are in fact probably
part of their food chain

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:90%
rather than anything else.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that's not a place
where we want to be.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times
when we talk about

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that, they make us aware that
there's a reason that they came

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to us and that I went
through this journey

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to understand about
Omicron Commonwealth

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
is because there's a
great evil that's coming.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned in
that first episode

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
about being taken into
the Draco constellation.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And everything was roiling
and on fire and just lots

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:90%
of violence.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they're saying
is that since they've

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
allied with the serpents, the
serpents brought terrible weapon

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
knowledge to them that
they didn't have before.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they say that
now there's what

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
they call a mega planet
that's capable of being mobile

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and that it's armed
with anti-matter weapons

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:90%
and hyper tunneling.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
destroying whole planets.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're raping
the resources.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And they don't care about
civilizations anymore.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I can do without them.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I can enslave something else.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:90%
That's their mentality.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:90%
That's our worst nightmare.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
showed me this vision,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I saw a great ships
coming out of it,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and I saw them picking up
resources and taking them

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
off someplace else.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.548 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they were taking them,

00:15:09.548 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
but clearly, they
were claiming what

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:84%
was left, whole civilizations
being destroyed.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:90%
They just did not care.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to think that
this was a better way to war

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.550 align:middle line:90%
from this point on.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no
other civilization

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.018 align:middle line:84%
that has a means to fight that,
then they're pretty lawless.

00:15:28.018 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:84%
They're just going to
go through the cosmos

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and do this at whatever
rate they can get there.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when they came
to us, they said,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Omicron Commonwealth
has to come together.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to unite the
planet, get into the federation

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.930 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
require all of these planets

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.817 align:middle line:84%
to fight this great evil
that's coming, otherwise,

00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
be able to stop it.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And Earth will no longer
exist because it's

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:84%
right in the pathway
of all of that.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:10%
So I don't want to be
an alarmist, however,

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:10%
we're being given knowledge
about what's coming.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is true that
they have technologies

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
which allow them to have
weapons that we haven't

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:90%
learned to fight against yet.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And so we have to get smarter.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able
to understand that--

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot of
people out there and they say,

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe in
extraterrestrials.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to say is,
well, if you continue that path,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you won't have to worry because
you won't be human either.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:90%
You'll be gone.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't want
that to be our outcome,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:84%
then we have to start
believing in something.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say that, how can
you look at the cosmos so vast

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.765 align:middle line:84%
and not believe that there
isn't something more out there?

00:16:43.765 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's
that 20/20 vision.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: It is.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.235 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why have the Nagas
joined forces with the Dracos?

00:16:50.235 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: So
it's interesting.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to call
them Nagas because that's

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
a reference that I have, but
they refer to them as serpents.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
They've told us of
more than one species.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
scale at which they

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:84%
want to create their
empire requires

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:90%
something just as dastardly.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the serpents come in.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
They have technologies that
they're offering to the Draco,

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:20.050 align:middle line:84%
they have, I'm not going
to call it insight,

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call it an
awareness of weak places

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:90%
that they can insert themselves.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that there's
a benefit on both sides

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
to say we can take this
to a whole other level

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:90%
that we've never been to before.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we need to
start thinking outside the box.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think that in
joining forces with them,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:84%
they both have their
own agenda, of course,

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
they both want to rule the
entire third dimension,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.312 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:17:52.312 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going to happen

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:90%
when they get to that point.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine that one
would give way to the other.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think that ultimately,
that's what's going to happen,

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is that there's going
to be a huge warring

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:84%
factor between them,
they're just not--

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Self-destructive.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.825 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:18:07.825 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mutual
assured destruction.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Right.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.117 align:middle line:84%
But I think for
right now, they're

00:18:12.117 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
just using each
other to meet an end.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know when
it actually happened.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:90%
They weren't telling us that.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
What the Conclave was telling us
that this is what's been seen,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:90%
this is what we know.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:10%
And so what my original
Pleiadian that came to me,

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:10%
gave me as much information
as he could give.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:10%
I've asked the question
before, why would somebody

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:10%
do something like that?

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they don't
have an answer for it.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Not yet.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:45.776 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Right.

00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.657 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think anybody
will ever have that answer

00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:90%
until something has happened.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, I would rather
take care of the problem

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.040 align:middle line:84%
than wait for it to arrive
and see what happens.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why did the
United Federation contact you,

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
share all this information
with you when they're so highly

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
advanced compared
to our humanity?

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Think
of it like this.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:90%
We think outside the box.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:84%
We have experience
with very violent acts.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We're still a warring
country across the planet.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:90%
They've gotten away from that.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:90%
That is not their forte.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they looked at
it and said, wait a minute,

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:84%
they have direct
experience with this.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And they think outside
the box, because we do.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody can tell us
something and we're

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
going to come up with
something totally off the wall.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:90%
That's just our human nature.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: We're known for that.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
they're looking at, is

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:90%
that's what it's going to take.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:84%
For all of our technology, we
have to think outside the box,

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
why they came.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:84%
As they said, the one
gift that humans possess

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to
think outside the box.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we were never
in the box to begin with.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:84%
We have put ourselves out
there in every single moment.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Can't cage us.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:90%
They tried.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:90%
We're like wild nature.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's what it's
going to take to conquer this,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is something that can come
along and say, but what if?

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And we've done that already.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I've had some thoughts.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:84%
They gave me some technologies
and I took that technology

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and I said, given my
experience with what I know,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that I've come
up with an answer.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I gave them
what I thought.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And they said, and
that's why you're here.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
they're looking for from us,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to
think outside the box.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
These are things that they
don't have to do anymore.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They've become so advanced
and so much into technology

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.660 align:middle line:84%
that they've never had to put
themselves into that space

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
think outside the box.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Plus we need
to think outside the box.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:90%
We have to fall on our face.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.150 align:middle line:84%
We have to unfold this
terror that's coming.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And we
keep getting back up.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: So that's great.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Yeah.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that's
why they came with us.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, they
took me to the future.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:90%
So in the future, this happens.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the future,
we are so successful.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:90%
But we have to make that happen.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You have no future if you don't
start now to make that happen.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
where we're at,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:90%
is that, yes, we're building it.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And believe me,
people, they think

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that we've been called
Space Force and Looney Tunes

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
things, and that's fine,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:84%
but what I'm going to
say is that why did

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:84%
they show us something so epic
like this unless they need us?

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't stand
up and answer that call,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
then we failed humanity.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't want to be
the one that failed humanity.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very well put.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.623 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge you got, the
education, that is their help.

00:22:09.623 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the help right there.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.858 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:22:11.858 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is trying to
communicate with us on different

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
levels with different people to
get these messages out so we can

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:90%
prepare.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And the problem
is that we don't readily

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:84%
or we're not willing,
I'm not sure which it is,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:90%
to be able to communicate.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure they've tried this
over and over and over again

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:84%
until they finally hit someone
that's willing to listen.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And so like I say,
I feel so blessed

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:90%
that they came into my life.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saddened that people
are still fighting the system.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to come
together as a humanity.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they're giving
us that opportunity.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But are we going to
stand up and take it,

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:90%
or are we going to let it go by?

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if it goes by, what's
coming is not our salvation.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Until open contact,
does this prime directive

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.598 align:middle line:90%
influence the outcome?

00:23:05.598 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Well,
of course it does.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, they want to
be non-interventionist,

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
because that's what their
prime directive says.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
We will not change
the course or pathway

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
in the evolutionary
process of a species,

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and yet that's what
they're asking us to do.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And so are they violating
their prime directive?

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I think at some level, we have
to look at things and say,

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:90%
what's the greater good?

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a criteria in
the way in which we value it.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they've
looked at it and said, look,

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:84%
this is one of those times when
the prime directive, while it's

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.630 align:middle line:84%
well-meaning, is it going
to cover what's happening.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what they're
hoping is that the more--

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and we've had more
and more sightings.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
We're just off the charts now
with the number of sightings

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY:
International news now.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.635 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:23:56.635 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is they're

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:90%
trying to get our attention.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think once they
get our attention

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and we're willing to have
communication with them,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.260 align:middle line:84%
then I think we're not going
to be able to move forward.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we're willing to
have that contact with them

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and that we're willing to
treat them as a species

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
just like we're a species,
instead of being afraid of them

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
or fighting against them, that's
what we've done up to now.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So what I would say is that
if we're going to move forward

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:84%
with this, we really need to
stop being the paranoid human

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and start being who we really
are, which is we're strong,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:90%
we're confident.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
We've lived on this planet
through many, many different

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:90%
ages of trial and error.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And so by now we should
know enough to say

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.940 align:middle line:84%
we know what's important,
and it is the value of life.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And we need to stop
fighting each other

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.325 align:middle line:84%
and start remembering that
there's a greater evil coming

00:24:58.325 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have
to probably stand up

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:90%
against and fight.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
do that, we need

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.140 align:middle line:90%
to start having communications.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:11.201 align:middle line:84%
Open yourself up to being
a viable communicator.

00:25:11.201 --> 00:25:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So What strategies do
you believe that a small planet,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:84%
like here, Earth, we have to
get together and have some sort

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:90%
of defense system.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
What's the United
Galactic Federation

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.207 align:middle line:90%
going to do to help create that?

00:25:24.207 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Well, what's
interesting is they're already

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.920 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
They usually park outside on
the other side of the moon.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: So they
are watching our back.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is is we're
not actively participating,

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and that becomes the problem.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:90%
They have a large fleet.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They have a planetary
defense fleet.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:90%
It's very large.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And while they're
asked to not intervene,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
they are there in case
something goes wrong,

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:90%
then they will intervene.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's always concise.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what
they're saying is we're here,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
we're protecting your
back, but you just

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.410 align:middle line:84%
need to learn to
communicate with us so

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:90%
that we can do it actively.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And so like I say, on the
other side of the moon,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
we know they're there
because they've told us that.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.372 align:middle line:84%
There apparently is
a very large cruiser

00:26:10.372 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that's on the other
side of the moon that

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:90%
can take on quite a bit.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:90%
So that makes me feel good.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But the way in which
we need to move forward

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.370 align:middle line:90%
is to be open to communication.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They can tell when
we're closed off

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:90%
because our energy says that.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
to do is be more open.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.120 align:middle line:90%
I've seen people--

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I love when we go out to the
desert and everybody sits around

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.883 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to call the ships.

00:26:35.883 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
they don't see us,

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is that
you have to be open.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.115 align:middle line:84%
Just because your
mind is saying,

00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:84%
oh, let's make contact
doesn't mean your heart

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%
is saying let's make contact.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
the difference,

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is that they can see
that frequency that we're

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:90%
admitting to the cosmos.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they're looking for.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if we united
together and everybody did that?

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:84%
We'd be like a beacon of light
saying, yes, we're ready.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
we really need to get,

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to open our
communication system so that's

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:90%
what our energy is sending out.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:90%
It can't be a brain function.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are just
merely using up energy.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Our heart--

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's the light
body, the heart light.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.923 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Right, right.

00:27:20.923 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Our heart is generating
so much more energy,

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's the thing
that we need to be using.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.872 align:middle line:90%
This is just hard drive.

00:27:28.872 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's right.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: And so when we
learn to understand what that

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
is, quit using the hard
drive to contact them with.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Start using that
heart energy that's

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:90%
generating to contact with them.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, there's a lot
of talk out there in the news,

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.990 align:middle line:84%
pop culture, everywhere of all
the diabolical things that may

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:84%
or may not happen,
like a pole shift,

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
a brown dwarf sneaking
up, we have volcanoes,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
we have all these terrible
things that are being predicted

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you think, number 1, what's
your thoughts on all that?

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And will they help us,
the extraterrestrials?

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And will the law of 1 prevail
through this whole transition,

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.310 align:middle line:90%
is what I call it?

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Transition
is a good word.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:90%
So let's start out.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a cycle.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
We see them over and over again.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.930 align:middle line:90%
That's how energy works.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:90%
It goes in a cycle.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we are in an
Earth cycle right now.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of them call it a
Yuga cycle, some of it

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:90%
call an end cycle.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
You can call it
whatever you want.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter
is that the energies

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
are built in that stage of that
cycle to do certain things.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And we live on a planet
where one influence

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:90%
causes another influence.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to start seeing

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that where our tides
are being changed

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and our temperatures changing
and volcanoes are erupting.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:84%
They're all influencing each
other because of this cycle.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And so people, of
course, will get scared

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:90%
if they don't understand.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I look at it, I have an
understanding about cycles

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and we understand the
science of things.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn
how things work, we

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.160 align:middle line:90%
tend to look at it differently.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we are very
much in this cycle

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:84%
where the Earth is beginning
to bring in new consciousness.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
We can't stay the
same consciousness.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:90%
That would be ridiculous.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.972 align:middle line:84%
We'd be going back
to the Dark Ages.

00:29:20.972 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Never evolve.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:22.805 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:29:22.805 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And so this new
consciousness is coming in.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to the
end of an Earth cycle.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start seeing
more coronal mass ejections

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:90%
because there's an influence.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's what it is, is
that one energy is influencing

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:90%
another energy and so on.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a cascading effect.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when we see all these
energies coming together,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we have a massive
evolution occurring, maybe

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:90%
on a catastrophic level.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes that's
what has to happen.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
to knock a wall down

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:84%
to realize that there's a
beautiful space out there.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the case may be.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And so this has happened
over and over again,

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.170 align:middle line:84%
it's just we're
there to witness it.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.507 align:middle line:84%
The fortunate part, I was
going to say unfortunate,

00:30:11.507 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:90%
but that's not true.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.798 align:middle line:84%
The fortunate part
is we're getting

00:30:13.798 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to witness the Earth
go through this cycle

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and being able to evolve itself
into something wonderful.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
our geologic record

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
shows that wonderful
things occurred afterwards.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so why would that
not happen this time?

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just we read
fiction or we see movies

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and they show us the worst
that they can show us.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.545 align:middle line:90%
And so then that's all we know.

00:30:40.545 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what's going to happen

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.320 align:middle line:84%
is that we are getting
this new consciousness

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth, that's
why people are waking up.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
as we move forward,

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:54.345 align:middle line:84%
that is just going to be a
better evolution for all of us.

00:30:54.345 --> 00:30:55.470 align:middle line:90%
When is it going to happen?

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what people always ask.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.447 align:middle line:90%
Well, when did it start?

00:30:59.447 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's already happened.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.605 align:middle line:90%
It's starting.

00:31:01.605 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA: Exactly.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:90%
It already started.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that where we're at
in the evolution of things,

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
based on what we've seen, we're
probably looking at 2027 for it

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:90%
to complete its cycle.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But my guess is only as good as
whatever time factor I'm using.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to say is that,

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.350 align:middle line:84%
yes, we are getting
new energies,

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and there are influences
that are happening,

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing on some levels
some distraction from it.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But you can't
build something new

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:84%
without something
being destroyed.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we're well on
our way to something beautiful.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What's your vision
for the future, post 2027?

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA: Well,
what I'm hoping--

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
like I say, we have this great
evil that they've told us about.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.447 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping that we come
up with that influence

00:31:57.447 --> 00:31:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that they believe we're going
to be able to come up with

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:90%
and to take care of that.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that we can
survive anything.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.370 align:middle line:84%
We've proven that
over and over again.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So with what's
happening to the Earth,

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that we'll be
able to survive that.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's going to come
out of it is a new awareness.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I think people are going
to realize that oh, look,

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:84%
energy really is
important to us.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Having a belief
system that says,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I can heal with energies and
that I can love somebody else,

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
different, but because they're

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.930 align:middle line:90%
a human being.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're going to
see a big change in our belief

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think really
in the future, I

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:49.860 align:middle line:84%
see us being able
to come together.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.848 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been together
for a long time.

00:32:51.848 --> 00:32:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we're going
to be able to do that.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to be able
to understand that there's

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:84%
value in each of us and
that we can appreciate

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that value, and
especially diversity.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.427 align:middle line:84%
Without diversity,
what do we have?

00:33:06.427 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
diversity, you don't

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.530 align:middle line:84%
have the skills and
the experience and all

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.930 align:middle line:84%
these different things that
it takes to become creative

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and to be supportive
and to grow.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we will
begin to value diversity.
