>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
we're with Sébastien Martin, a
retired chairman of the board

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:10%
of a multinational business
who has participated in covert

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:10%
remote viewing assignments
for the CIA analyst.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Today we are talking about
secret underground facilities

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:90%
at Sandia Labs.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.075 align:middle line:90%
Sébastien, welcome.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SÉBASTIEN MARTIN: Well, thank
you for having me again, Emery.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Oh, one of my
favorite topics, of course,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
since I've worked there,
Sandia Laboratories.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited to interview
you about this because you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
corresponding information

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
that relates to a lot of
stuff that I've been through.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So tell me, what is
going on at Sandia Labs?

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And how did you come
to this information?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.803 align:middle line:84%
We had talked
about this at lunch

00:00:58.803 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
a little bit so I'm so
excited to get into it.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: For sure.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I was not privy to the
Sandia Labs as a facility.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:10%
Like, I didn't know
anything about it.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:10%
I was only asked to remote view
the place to see the type of ETs

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:10%
that they held there.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So for me, like, I
was given a target,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:90%
but it was not coordinates.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
They just gave me the
name and from the name

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:90%
I was able to be there.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Like see it with my
remote viewing skills,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I was able to go straight on
the ground 25 floors down,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:90%
seeing those beings.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
They were basically in cells,
but they were mostly glass,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:90%
like thick glass.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And they could see each other.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And the floor to me
was solid, obviously.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.198 align:middle line:84%
And then there were some like
doors basically opening up--

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was
opening up this way.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And some gas was
emanating from that.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And I saw some solid
foods that I would not

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
recognize that was
also coming up as well.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the type of
ET that was in those cells,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:90%
they were fed differently.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And that surprised me because
the first thing that I saw was,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.200 align:middle line:84%
one, there were different
species together.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Two, they felt like they
were harmless in a way,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
but I assumed that there could
have been dangerous to us

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
in any shape or form, I
think through telepathy,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
through their
physical form, just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:84%
by breathing in different
environments and what

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of toxic gas that
they would release onto us

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and potentially kill
us, be poisonous.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
I've noticed about them

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.955 align:middle line:90%
was that they felt distressed.

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
They were all feeling
distressed because they

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:84%
were a product of analysis that
they were being analyzed for.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:90%
That's why they were captured.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were not
consenting to be there.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you mind telling me
who asked you to do the remote

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:90%
view?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: My CIA contact told
me to just target that because I

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
had my own ET counter,
and from that,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
just to be at peace with other
races and what was out there

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and what was about to encounter
through those missions,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see and not being
frightened by other races that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:90%
were out there.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us a little bit
about your contact experience

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:90%
with that ET?

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: That
happened in 2011.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I was waking up from a dream,
and I was basically in my bed.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And I could remember this being.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I could only see his
torso and up to his head.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And I could see him smiling at
me with a very bright smile.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:90%
And his cheekbones were high up.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:84%
He had big eyes,
bigger than human eyes,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and he had, like, wavy hair,
almost like a Californian surfer

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:90%
dude.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But the physical
appearance, like I said,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
the eyes were like three times
the size of a human eyes.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But that still shook
me just from seeing

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that because it
looked different,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and it seemed like
he recognized me.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- like I
said, it was just a dream.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
But yet when I went
to work that day,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and I remember I was the
only one in the office

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
because it was the 11 of
November, 2011, so 11, 11, 11.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my
screen, computer screen,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and I looked through the window.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:90%
My house was on the other side.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I could see basically that
being that I saw in my dreams

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:90%
through in my field of vision.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:90%
So the body would not go away.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, he would still be
there for the whole day.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was just wondering why.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the evenings I
went back to my house,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and I decided to meditate on it.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And I poured myself
a chamomile tea,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was waiting for it to
seep over on the counter.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And I sit down
and close my eyes,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel the energy
going like this around me,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.617 align:middle line:90%
gravitate like moving.

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel that, and
then all of a sudden it

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:90%
stopped moving around me.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
When I opened my eyes, it was
actually standing up right

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:90%
And he was basically--

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a bookshelf
next to the TV,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and he was standing up right
in front of the bookshelf.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And I could see this blue
glow of energy around him.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:90%
He looked physical to me.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So when that being
showed up, I just

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
realized that, first of all, I
was completely frozen in fear.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I was on my sofa and I was
looking at it with my open eyes

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:90%
and I could not move.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:90%
And I could not stand up.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
My first reaction was trying
to stand up and act and protect

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:90%
my family and all of that.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:90%
That was not the case.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I was unable to move.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And so then he said to me
telepathically, he said,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:90%
don't worry.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:90%
This is all normal.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to fear.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And he said, my name is Zoar.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm from the
Galactic Alliance.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.145 align:middle line:90%
That's what I remember.

00:05:58.145 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say
Galactic Federation,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:90%
he just said Galactic Alliance.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:10%
And after that, he
kind of explained to me

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:10%
that we had this life
which was illusory.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:90%
It was temporary.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:90%
It was just like a bad movie.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And that we are connected with
our soul energies to them.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.773 align:middle line:90%
They know who we are.

00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:22.815 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what race
is this extraterrestrial?

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Pleiadian.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.005 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Pleiadian.

00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I basically
didn't know how long

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
this lasted because to me it
felt like 10 minutes, 15 minutes

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:90%
at the most.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
vanished in a haze,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
so that's when I realized
he was not physical.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I stood up and I was walking
back towards my kitchen counter

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
to grab my tea, and that's when
I realized that the tea was

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:90%
cold, when I put it to my lips.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the clock and I
had 2.5 hours of missing time.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And so in the meantime, that
being came back to see me,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:84%
like, not physically,
but only once.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:84%
But telepathically
he spoke to me

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and then he shared
more information

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
with me, which was
relating to the ET beings

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and part of the alliance
that they were a part of.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
there was a correlation

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
between that being with
those beings at Sandia Labs

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
were actually part of
the Galactic Alliance,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily
enemies of the human race.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how many
did you see of these--

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
you said, there's
different rooms.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Like, how many?

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I saw--

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.915 align:middle line:90%
it was a while ago so.

00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah, sure, sure.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: There was maybe
like five on one row only,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
but there was some
more on the other side.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.395 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was in the
middle between the two?

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It's just a row.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
A row like an alleyway
for scientists or--

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What color were
these rooms made out of glass?

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.205 align:middle line:90%
Was there a backdrop?

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I did not see--

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
backdrop of those rooms.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember the front glass,
which was pretty thick,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and there were all the same,
the side glasses, which

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:90%
were exactly the same as well.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:90%
So they could see one another.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you remember what
these extraterrestrials looked

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:90%
like, any of them?

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Could you describe
those in detail?

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
humanoid shapes in there,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and there were some that
looked-- resembled almost

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:90%
like a brain.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
struck me the most is

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
it was a standalone being
that was there, that didn't

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:90%
look like anything like human.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And when the feed came
through the floor,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I did not see anything
coming out of his room,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that it was
a gas coming through.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
was the substance of it

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
or how it was made
of, nothing, but I

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
could see it with my own
eyes like a mini movie.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
It was actually happening
and I could see it.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:90%
That was striking to me.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But I was not focusing
on the other rooms,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
for some reason I was not
curious enough to just go

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:90%
around and look around.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking sideways on
all these rooms and these ET

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:90%
beings on that row.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
like yellowish--

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
yellowish in color, very
humanoid, like a broomstick.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Like the head was kind
of elongated and the nose

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
was long as well, but not very
long, and thin, very thin.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.185 align:middle line:90%
Very, very small, tiny eyes.

00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:34.960 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't really tell--

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the eyes, if
there was an iris or anything

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
else, but I remember that there
was an opening and that's it.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I couldn't
describe the others

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
is because I could
see the first two,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and the third and the
fourth and the fifth

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.305 align:middle line:84%
were not very clear because
they were all on one line.

00:09:51.305 --> 00:09:52.105 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Got it.

00:09:52.105 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It's almost like they
were not like moving around.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
They were quite peaceful in
a way, but they were all--

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
pretty much from
my field of vision,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:84%
they were all on the same row
and they were not really moving.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So, like I said, I could
distinct two of them,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and then the third one I
barely remember what it was.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know about the
fourth and the fifth one.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why do
you think, Sébastien,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
you think it would
be more private?

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I've
seen a lot of these

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
but what do you know
about the walls are glass

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.166 align:middle line:84%
even next to other
captured extraterrestrials?

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes,
that's interesting.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:84%
What I was able to
pick up from that,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
this is not something that you
can see through remote viewing,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
but as a remote viewer
you can also feel.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You get information,
and what strikes me

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:84%
the most at that moment
was that the glass,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the glass between each other
was really tamper proof.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.572 align:middle line:84%
They were not able
to hear each other.

00:10:54.572 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Communicate, right.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.363 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: They could
not communicate.

00:10:57.363 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Telepathic communications
could not go through.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This was on purpose
to distress them

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
more so they could extract
more information from them,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
because the people holding
them were not friendly to them.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:90%
They were prisoners.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.605 align:middle line:84%
They were not there out of
their own will, therefore,

00:11:14.605 --> 00:11:17.506 align:middle line:84%
if they could see each other
but not communicate, that's--

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
it's a huge stress on them.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Because telepathy and
telepathic communication

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is very important
to their races,

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, without that
they feel like powerless

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So if they do extract these
kind of informations from them,

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:84%
then they bring that
prisoner back to their cell

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and they could just
look at each other

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and they won't know
what they talk about.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's where, really,
the fine line of psychology

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
plays a role in the ET
races present there.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:90%
And it does work.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why do you
think in Sandia Labs that

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
they've captured these
galactic friends?

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Because you know one.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why would they
treat them like that?

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Just to
extract information.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And the people working for the
government or for Sandia Labs

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
at the time, they were
in it to get information,

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to extract information at any
cost, even to their lives.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't care.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a signed
contract with the Alliance

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
so they wanted to reverse
engineer more technology.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:84%
They want to access to
more information that was

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:90%
critical to them at that time.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to get it in
any shape, or form, in any way

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:90%
they could.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much why
they were doing it.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But those races were
friends to humanity,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.257 align:middle line:84%
for sure, but not necessarily
to the people they were--

00:12:43.257 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Not to that
organization or corporation.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Organization
or corporation, exactly.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what other unique
things did you observe there?

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Did you see workers?

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Did you see regular
people that would work

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.222 align:middle line:90%
there tending to the prisoners?

00:12:58.222 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Funnily enough, no.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
When I saw those beings,
they were just by themselves.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It almost looked like I could
feel the human presence,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:84%
but they were not
specifically there.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They were observing them,
for sure, however, I

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:84%
believe that they
left them on purpose

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.752 align:middle line:90%
so they could stress them more.

00:13:17.752 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:90%
So to give them some--

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
give them some time to
start wandering and--

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.795 align:middle line:84%
who said what and
those kind of things.

00:13:25.795 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were you able
to connect to any of those

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials
when you are viewing?

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.605 align:middle line:84%
Or did any of them
look over at you?

00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: That's
a good question.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I observed them all, and
none of them noticed me.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.175 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to
connect to them.

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Because
you felt this--

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I felt the presence,
I could feel the anxiety

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
so, therefore, there was
a contact to some extent.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
they were not feeling

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:84%
invaded for me being there
and trying to look at them,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.423 align:middle line:84%
so they kind of let me
without judging and without--

00:13:59.423 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I think they probably felt
me but they didn't judge.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.655 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you
smell anything?

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I didn't
smell anything.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:04.115 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: No.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I think if I smelled something,
that wouldn't be a good thing--

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.942 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Because you're there.

00:14:08.942 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: --because of the
gases that they use to feed

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:90%
those beings, one of them.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And even the food itself, I
think, was not that human-like.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
kind of substance

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
it was, but it was solid but it
didn't look like anything that I

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:90%
recognized as a food.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.445 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of their
food is actually

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
poisonous to us and
some of those gases

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that they use to keep them alive
in their own atmosphere are

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:33.870 align:middle line:90%
deadly to us.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Right.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But the physical food that
I've seen served on a plate--

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:90%
it was on a plate--

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.833 align:middle line:84%
it just showed up
on the surface.

00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Oh, right, when
it came out of the ground.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: When it
came out of the ground.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a jello.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Does it make sense?

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Like cubes of food that's
somewhat transparent,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
somewhat like more solid or
opaque, but there was no origin.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.855 align:middle line:84%
I didn't recognize where
it was or what was in it.

00:15:00.855 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Weren't you surprised
that the CIA is asking you

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.992 align:middle line:84%
to remote view this super
top secret area that they

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
don't really kind
of know about it?

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Or do they?

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: They do.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, some
of the agents know

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:84%
because they do
work for the SSP,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.733 align:middle line:84%
and some regular CIA
operatives don't necessarily

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
know about the Sandia Labs
because they have nothing

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:90%
to do with it.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't been assigned
to this job in particular, so.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, what did
you tell the officer that--

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.905 align:middle line:84%
what was your-- what
did you tell him?

00:15:31.905 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I described what I
saw and said, you are right.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Oh, she
said, you're right.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:90%
That was another test maybe.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I think it was
just for my own confirmation.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:90%
She knew that they were there.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:84%
She just wanted me to observe
them from my own point of view

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and ask me about
how I felt about it.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.865 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did
you feel about it?

00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Like I said, I
could feel their distress,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't-- that didn't make
me feel good because I knew that

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
they were trapped and that
they could not get out.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
get out, but they

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.142 align:middle line:84%
didn't know how long this was
going to last, or nothing.

00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how is the protocol
that you have to go through when

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
she calls you up to say, hey,
I need you to do this mission.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So for me
it works differently.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I could just be given like a
picture, and from that picture

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to remote
view that person.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I could be given
a name, and that's

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
also sometimes sufficient,
especially for locations.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not given coordinates,
I'm not given any locations,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Just names and pictures.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So for this mission
specifically,

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I was just told the name
of Sandia Labs, which

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard of, and
I was able to connect it

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:90%
to the desert.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So the feelings I
had when I first

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:90%
felt it was like sand and hot.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And then right away
from that feeling,

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I was inside those cells.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Not inside the cells but
I was seeing those cells

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:84%
in a row from the
outside of the cell.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was instantly
being sent there,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
knowing where I
was, like, almost

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:90%
on what level, what floor.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the
importance of the site.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I could feel how big it was.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of sense
going from seeing

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
those aliens to everything
else that was in that facility.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: How large was it?

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.618 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.618 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It was very large.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You talk about going down
25 feet, that's 25 levels.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:90%
This was going further down.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know the
actual depth of it.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.915 align:middle line:90%
You probably do.

00:17:52.915 --> 00:17:53.875 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No, I don't, actually.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: You don't?

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Like, basically,
it was very wide as well

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:90%
and on the ground.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:90%
So it was not just one line.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It was not like you
take an elevator shaft

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and you go into one
room or two rooms.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:90%
It was massive.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:90%
That was my feeling.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was not just for
this particular floor,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
each floor was
different in size.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So some were wider,
some were smaller.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Thus, these are the feelings
that I got from that experience.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know the use of each
floor, obviously, or anything

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
else but when I
went there, I had

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:90%
this general feel of the place.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
a radar, ecography

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:84%
through the whole thing like in
one swoop and then feeling that.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did you know that
that was Sandia and not like

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.155 align:middle line:90%
another secret laboratory?

00:18:50.155 --> 00:18:50.955 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:18:50.955 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So in remote viewing, when
you go through protocols,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.595 align:middle line:84%
you can be given
coordinates like targets,

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:90%
these whole things.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I never got trained through
the Monroe Institute

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:90%
to do remote viewing.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I know of the people there,
I've worked with them

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily using
their method because I

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:90%
can't connect to their method.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Like the breathing techniques
and the meditation part,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that's fine because that's
kind of generic to me.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've used
transcendental meditation

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
since I was a child so
for me that was normal.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But for this
particular instance,

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
because I could just naturally
remote view locations or people,

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't waste time.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's all about truth.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
If you tell me to do something,
I just do it truthfully,

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I do.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.962 align:middle line:90%
I don't do anything else.

00:19:41.962 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I have zero agenda for
looking at something else that

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.318 align:middle line:90%
was not supposed to be there.

00:19:49.318 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you tell me,
go to Sandia Labs,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I say, OK, I'll go
got Sandia Labs.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time to waste.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.948 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's instant.

00:19:55.948 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It's instant, and
I'll just stick to the target

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:90%
for whatever I'm asked to do.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.015 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me the
instructions that she gave you

00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:05.815 align:middle line:90%
for the mission.

00:20:05.815 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So, again, that happened
a long time ago.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And when she asked
me to go, she said,

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
if you want to feel better,
more comfortable about the ETs--

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
because I had an
encounter of my own

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have many but at
that time, and so she said,

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.590 align:middle line:84%
go to Sandia Labs and it'll
make you feel better about it.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that she
did say to see some ETFs,

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
but she wasn't very
specific about what

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to be seeing and
under what context or anything

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.153 align:middle line:84%
Just said Sandia Labs,
ETs, end of the story.

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It was
really negative though.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
She said, you'll feel better
if you go, you just said.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Not better, just to
feel more at ease with those

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
beings because for me, like
seeing an ET in my living room

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:84%
was quite surprising
and disturbing,

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and I was not used to that.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So because I was unprepared
for this kind of world,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:84%
she kind of tried to help me
out with this down the line.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- I'm talking
about that in 2016.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think she did
this to prep you for a future ET

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:90%
contact?

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, I believe so.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I think she knew that those
beings were coming into my life

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:90%
more and more through missions.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
What I've experienced
with the stargates,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that was to me very
shocking and disturbing.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling that I had
being attacked psychically

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
was definitely a
negative in my life

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
how to handle this.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know who were
friendly and who were foes.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So for me I had to
be prepared, and I

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
was obviously anxious
about potential ETs

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
that I may see in the future.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was to ease
me into the role of seeing

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
potential future ETs even
through remote viewing role.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's go back a
little bit and tell me about

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:90%
your second encounter with Zoar.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So I was
contacted in 2011,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:11.462 align:middle line:84%
and then the next contact
after that was in 2015.

00:22:11.462 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:90%
So it took some time.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I was in communication
with Zoar,

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of my staff family,
telepathically for this time.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But last time he came to see
me, I was just watching a movie

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and he just appeared to
me telepathically then.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I could basically just feel
the energy of the room change.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
There were
silhouettes, including

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.927 align:middle line:90%
heels, on the back wall.

00:22:43.927 --> 00:22:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were all lined up,
and they were looking at me.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And I could move.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
I was not like the first time.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I was able to sit down,
but for some reason

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:90%
I was asked to meditate.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I did for out of
the blue for no reason.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.675 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why even I did it.

00:22:58.675 --> 00:22:59.905 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It helps
you see them better.

00:22:59.905 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I sat down.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And as I was meditating
with my eyes closed,

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing
two golden rings.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Like one ring going like
this around my body and then

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:84%
the other one going
the other way.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
moving slowly.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I opened my eyes
and I could still see them.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And those rings kept being
in motion for a long time,

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
until it formed a sphere,
like a golden sphere that

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:90%
was going that fast.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And then through that I
could see sparks in the room.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Those beings were
still in the back.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:90%
I could still see them.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden I could see

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
what looked like mandalas like
different shapes and sizes

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:84%
going on a 5% decline in
front of me, like moving down.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what it meant.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:90%
I just saw them.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
what they meant.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, telepathically,
I heard a message.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And the message was, be
aware of the Anunnaki.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:90%
That's all I heard.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And did that come to
fruition at any point during

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.420 align:middle line:84%
your work where the
Anunnaki contacted you?

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you worked with
things the Anunnaki built.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, yes.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And maybe that
rubbed off on you a little bit,

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.595 align:middle line:90%
that energy.

00:24:21.595 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I guess the line between
Pleiadians and Anunnaki

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.160 align:middle line:84%
to me was fairly
blurry for a while

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
because I could not
somewhat distinguish them,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:90%
from my experience.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I was being confused for
saying, we are one and the same

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
or we are basically-- we
say we are the Anunnaki

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:90%
but we are actually Pleiadians.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I didn't
really study the topic.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I did not go on
websites to find out

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:84%
about the Pleiadians or
people experiencing Pleiadians

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
or Anunnakis so for me it was
based on what I could feel

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and the information
that I was receiving.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:90%
And I saw that I relied on.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I was
really confused by that.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And then from my
experiences going

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
into the stargate
and the pyramid,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:84%
then that's when I knew that
they were not one and the same.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.955 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did Zoar give you any
idea that there was a lineage

00:25:17.955 --> 00:25:18.755 align:middle line:90%
connection?

00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:90%
So at first, no.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:84%
All I could feel from
him when he saw me

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
with his big, bright smile
was that he recognized me

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:90%
but I did not recognize him.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It's only when I went
through regressions,

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I went through
clinical hypnotherapy,

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and only through that was I able
to realize that he considered

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.106 align:middle line:84%
me to be his little brother,
or he was my little brother.

00:25:45.106 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And he came to see
me against protocol.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what I've been told.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So he was not supposed to be
coming over and awakened me

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
or trying to make
me see more things.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
He came because he
wanted to see me,

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.015 align:middle line:84%
and everything changed
for me since then.

00:26:03.015 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: With your experience
with Zoar and, of course,

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
witnessing these
extraterrestrials being held

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
against their will, what
conclusion did you come to that

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:90%
you were shown all of this?

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.936 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there must be a
message you're contemplating.

00:26:16.936 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe that within
our governments,

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
there are many factions
and offices that

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:90%
work towards their own agenda.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:90%
They want to know more.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
They want to reverse engineer
equipment as well, technology,

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.270 align:middle line:84%
without knowing what
goes on next door.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they only know
so much and they only

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
have whatever they
have available too

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and so they use whatever
material and whatever beings

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.730 align:middle line:84%
they have to their disposal
without truly understanding

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.340 align:middle line:90%
the larger picture.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:90%
That's one aspect of it.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
SSP side of things where

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:90%
they know about aliens and ETs.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
They do capture aliens
as well, but that's--

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.570 align:middle line:84%
they're not friends of
the SSP or they're just

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:90%
definitely enemies.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's different.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.692 align:middle line:84%
They work on a different level
because they are more advanced

00:27:13.692 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and they have more
access to technologies

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that are still considered
science fiction to us today.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:23.503 align:middle line:84%
So for them, they have
broader information

00:27:23.503 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:84%
than the regular
governments don't have.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sébastien, this has
been an amazing interview.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.305 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for coming on the show.

00:27:31.305 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Oh, well, thank
you for having me again.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
