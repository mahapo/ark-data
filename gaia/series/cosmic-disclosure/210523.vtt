>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we're with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:10%
a retired counterintelligence
agent who served in the Air

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:10%
Force Office of
Special Investigations.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts, trying
to understand the missions

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

>> What militaries and agencies
around the world have explored

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:84%
the realms of the
paranormal phenomena?

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:90%
And like why would they?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the first
that did so, I assume,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:10%
in history were the Germans
and back in World War II.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:10%
They had a department
that was actually

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:10%
looking for Naval
ships in the ocean,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:10%
and they found them
by using a pendulum.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:10%
They also had certain
groups in Germany

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:10%
at that time coming from the
1920s because at that time,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:10%
Germany were doing this
kind of seances and--

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Mystical practices.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Mystical practices,
right, right, right.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:10%
And some of the
most clever ideas

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:10%
are being said to have
been remotely viewed

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.475 align:middle line:10%
by these people, these psychics.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the organization
have a name?

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Do they call it something, or--

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm not quite sure.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:10%
So one name that usually
pops up as the Thule Society.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:10%
But I would say
that around Himmler

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:10%
who was super deep
and interested

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:10%
in this kind of
stuff, he gathered

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:10%
some of the renowned
psychics at that time

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:10%
and they would basically doing
remote viewing without calling

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:10%
it that way.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The coin remote viewing was
developed by the SDI Laboratory

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Putoff's laboratory with
Geller and Russell Targ and Dr.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Kitt Green.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
It was an operation
we knew about.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
We, United States
government, knew early

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s of people that
had-- military people had

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
special abilities
to foresee things

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:90%
in the future or the past.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And there were a number of
experiments that were done then

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
under the United States
Army but they couldn't

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
explain what they were doing.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:84%
These remote viewers
back then in those days

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
were foreseeing something
but there wasn't

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:90%
any controlled environment.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
That's why SDI came into effect.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.415 align:middle line:90%
SDI was developed--

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:05.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Protocols.

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Protocols were standardized
and military remote viewing

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:90%
program Stargate was born.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, we knew early in the
'50s from Russian spies

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
the Russians had some
sort of a program

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
to remote-view, although it
wasn't called remote viewing.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
In the sense, they were
viewing past or present time.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:84%
There were a number of
different Russian programs,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
developmental programs
that occurred in the late

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
'50s and early '60s that
the CIA got wind of--

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
couldn't quite understand
what they were doing

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
but knew it was something
in the line of what

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
the US Army was experimenting
with during that same time

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:90%
frame.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Russians
and the United States

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
had probably the biggest program
dealing with remote viewing.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, other countries, after
we developed a protocol,

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:90%
started dabbling into it too.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there other agencies
besides the army, Rick,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that was utilizing that
in the United States?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, every department within
the Department of Defense,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Army, Air Force, Marine Corps,
and Navy used the products.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewers were attached
to the Defense Intelligence

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Agency, but they were loaned out
for missions, special missions.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And from 1975, during
the time frame when

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:84%
this was being
experimented with and there

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of experiments
of special remote viewers,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
the best of the
best, so to speak--

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and they would go
out and test them.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were so good
at some of the things

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
that they were
doing that instead

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
of a two-year or
24-month test program,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
they knocked that
down to nine months.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And they actually sent
them out in the field

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
because they were so good--

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Incredible.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --in what their
abilities were.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:10%
>> How did we stumble
upon remote viewing here

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:10%
in the United States?

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:10%
Where did it all start,
and how does it work?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:10%
>> So as far as I'm informed,
I think some of the spies that

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:10%
were at that time in the Cold
War place in the Soviet Union

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:10%
came across the fact that the
Russians were actually using

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:10%
psychics in order to spy on
the United States of America.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
US Army at that time--

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they took
it super seriously.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:10%
But at the-- then again,
they had to look into it

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:10%
and were pretty surprised
that it's really working.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:90%
So how does it work?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It works in that way that
every point in the universe

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
is connected to this
one-point field.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you can psychically
tap into that fact,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
then you can perceive certain
information out of that field.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:10%
They basically-- as you
have correctly said,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:10%
Rick, they have set up
standardized techniques

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:10%
in order to make sure that the
information results are legit.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:10%
But yes, that is how it works.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:10%
It gets its information
from this unified field.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:10%
And then it's basically
just impressions in a vision

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:10%
that are being
expressed and detailed.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> How dependable have
these paranormal tools been

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:90%
for the success of missions?

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've used them a number
of times not knowing that it

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:90%
was remote viewing.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I was never briefed
into remote viewing,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
but I had the occasions of
being at certain locations

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and needing assistance
from satellites.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So I would send a message
to NSA and turns it over

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:90%
to a remote viewer.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know this
until years later.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, till later.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But thinking it was
from NSA satellite.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But it was accurate
information, distinctly accurate

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Now I was also in
Europe at the time

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
when they were doing some
testing a new remote viewer.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And we had to go into Bulgaria
under diplomatic cover, Sofia,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Bulgaria, and drive
a Volkswagen Bug

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
to a certain point
near this apartment

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:84%
complex miles away from the
city center of Sofia, which

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:90%
is capital of Bulgaria.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.895 align:middle line:84%
And years later, I was
told that was a test.

00:07:35.895 --> 00:07:38.662 align:middle line:84%
You put this box in the back
seat with something in it,

00:07:38.662 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and we had to get
the remote viewer

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:90%
to remote view there, that.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So unwittingly,
I was involved in

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and testing and the
use of the product.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:54.295 align:middle line:84%
But going back, in the '70s,
we were able to remote view

00:07:54.295 --> 00:07:55.095 align:middle line:90%
a general.

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
General Dozier was kidnapped
by a terrorist group in Italy

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:90%
in 1979.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
He was held at some
location in Italy.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know where.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We sent commando teams
in, but a remote viewer--

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
probably one of the
best we ever had--

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:90%
remote viewed where he was.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem there,
though, they moved him.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:90%
They kept moving him.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't move him
from building to building.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
They moved him from
closet to closet,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but it appeared
to a remote viewer

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that he was being moved
to different locations.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But he couldn't
really pinpoint it.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So it took him some weeks
to actually pinpoint.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
And when he actually pinpointed
before they actually pinpointed

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:84%
him, they sent in a special
Air Force Intelligence

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.305 align:middle line:84%
unit, 1141st Special
Activities unit,

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:90%
that got into Italy, Aviano.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And they set up all this support
equipment for remote viewing

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and for a commando team,
the delta commando team,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
which was just newly created.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And when they
actually pinpoint it,

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes from the
point that he pinpointed,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that satellite message
came down to the team

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:90%
of exactly where he was.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And when they went into this
apartment, they located him.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> He was handcuffed or tied to
a radiator and exactly where he

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to be.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's the perfection
of remote viewing.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they use remote viewing
to find Saddam Hussein?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's not
classified anymore.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
out in the public.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:84%
In 2005 or '06 when they were
looking for Saddam Hussein,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
they had military remote viewers
on station 5 or 6 kilometers

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:90%
away from his actual location.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
He had a cell phone, and
they were tracking him.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.333 align:middle line:84%
But then he got rid
of the cell phone,

00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't
track him anymore.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
They had some of his
colleagues in custody

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.553 align:middle line:84%
interrogating them, trying
to find out where he was,

00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
giving up where he was.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But this one particular, really
a low level remote viewer.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I think he's only a E-3 or E-4,
but he had unique abilities,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:90%
pinpointed where he was.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But what's ironic
about this, he kept

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
telling his commander he was
underground at this location.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
But when the commander of
the team heard this, he said,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I think I don't know what he's
talking-- he's not underground.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:90%
He's at a building.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
He's at some building.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.115 align:middle line:84%
>> So when he went there,
the hole opened up the hatch,

00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and there he was.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Now I can tell you other
times where they were off.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Some remote viewers were off
by a few 100 yards or a town.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I was in Europe
trying to figure out

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
where somebody was that had
went into Czechoslovakia.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
We tried to get
all sorts of assets

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
in there and NSA
satellites and so forth.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But little did I
know that they had

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:90%
a remote viewer working on it.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I was given a hyperburst signal,
which is only 100 bits that

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
said he's at this location.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, we managed to get
inside Czechoslovakia

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:90%
to get to that location.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
there but a farmhouse.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was
a vacant farmhouse.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So I responded back
negative, negative, negative.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, over a period of
several hours, he got it right,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and then we found who
we were looking for.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you could
tell me this, Richard.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, they basically
acted like, oh, we're not

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:90%
doing remote viewing anymore.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The Army and CIA
was like, no, we

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
don't have those
programs anymore,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
even though they
were so successful.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And we spent millions
and millions of dollars

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:90%
on these programs.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Where is it today?

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what happened after,
the remote viewing program

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:90%
officially closed.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:90%
But it--

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Did it?

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> --became a special access
program under the control

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
of the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And they even allowed some
military branches, especially

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
the army, to operate their own
system under highly classified

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The problem is during
that time period, the fact

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that we had a remote
viewing leaked out.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:90%
So the Soviet Union's--

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
even after the Soviet
Union collapsed,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:90%
they still were our enemy.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:90%
China was our enemy.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:90%
North Korea was our enemy.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Anything we put
out in that press

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:90%
made its way to our enemies.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So then they decided to put
it under a classified program,

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:90%
which is what it is today.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's on a different
project's names

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
within different agencies
within the government,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
but there is an
active remote viewing.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a school
in Fort Belvoir,

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Maryland that trains
remote viewers

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:90%
of high classified school.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:90%
So they're still doing it.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Has remote viewing been
used to better understand

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
the information from our past?

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:55.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So what I read is that remote
viewing the past bears some

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:56.940 align:middle line:10%
challenges.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be much
easier to find targets

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:90%
that is in the current time.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
You can, for example,
foresee something

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that's happening in the
future, but there are so

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
many variables that are
still sorting itself out

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that the results
get really loose--

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --in that way.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:10%
Basically, I know
they have tried

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:10%
to do remote
viewing on, I guess,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:10%
Stonehenge and some
other sites like that.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But the information
that people get is--

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure
if this is accurate.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Has remote viewing ever been
used to find out anything about

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:90%
off-planet intelligences?

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:90%
And if so, give us an example.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the very first people
on this planet who have done

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
this are indeed
the 1930 Germans.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:14:00.080 align:middle line:84%
They tapped into all these
nonterrestrial intelligence

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and perceive a lot of
information from them

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:90%
through remote viewing.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, they didn't
call it that way,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
but there were people
that were quite busy

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:90%
tapping in those fields.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And what information
did they get from that?

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Did they find out
about a new species?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Were they able to
communicate with them?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, they were mostly
interested in technology,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:10%
of course, because the war just
started, was about to start,

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.690 align:middle line:10%
and they couldn't afford
getting any slower.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking for
new technology, new weapons.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Hitler stated especially
towards the end of the war

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that he was just waiting for
this magical weapon to finish.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So all the information they
gathered which documents say

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
are theory is about time,
which is pretty sophisticated.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:10%
I've seen the documents
from the Nazis

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:04.205 align:middle line:10%
about their theories about
time and how time works.

00:15:04.205 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
No one at that time--
no one in the 1940s

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:90%
knew so much about time.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:10%
And what they found out at that
time is still relevant today.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
It's undercover, but
it's 80% accurate.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't finish and
integrated it at that time

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because it was too
less time ironically.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But they had extensive
research programs on that.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Something I like to
add about remote viewing--

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
when they set up the
remote viewing program,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
it was very
administratively controlled,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
meaning that everything that the
remote viewer did was logged.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:90%
It was documented.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Every remote viewer
had a sheet that

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
was kept regardless
of what he wrote,

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
he or she wrote on
that piece of paper.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So everything was
really controlled,

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and every single remote
viewing session was graded.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It was graded, especially
during the training period.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And the remote viewers that
got lower grades sometimes

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:90%
were out of the program.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.530 align:middle line:84%
The ones obviously
that did the best

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that-- were
the A students, so to speak.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But when they
remote viewed, they

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
did it in a number
of different ways.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
They tried to number one,
remote view something

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:90%
currently is happening.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not quite possible
because 20 seconds has just

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:90%
passed of me and you talking.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:10%
So it would be
always in the past.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:84%
But they had different
categories of the past.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
They call it recent
pasts or distant pasts.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So if I wanted you to
remote view something that's

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
in the Soviet Union and Moscow--

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course, the
time zone's different.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So you're trying to
remote view a safe

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%
or a room inside the Kremlin.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Now it's in the past.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:90%
But it's in a recent past.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:10%
Now what confused the remote
viewers is if you said,

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:10%
I want you to review something
that happened 10 weeks ago.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:84%
As Tim said, now they have to
look through all those time

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
waves, that occurring, that
things that have already

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
passed, and that location that
you want them to remote view,

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.861 align:middle line:84%
there's all sorts of
things occurring there that

00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:90%
is occurring at the current--

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right now, right?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --time that's confusing
whether they're in the past.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's more easy for them to
remote view the recent past.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Now the future is
something else.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
There's been many
remote viewers that

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:90%
failed predicting the future.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, for instance,
in 1977, there

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
were a team of remote viewers
in different rooms trying

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
to review what was going
to happen in New Year's

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
day of 1980, January 1, 1980.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.170 align:middle line:84%
What is going to
happen on that day?

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.372 align:middle line:84%
What great event was going
to happen in that day?

00:18:02.372 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, none of them got
it right because they're

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
looking to the future something
that hasn't occurred yet.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So I know there's a lot
of talk about people

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:84%
being able to remote view 100
years from now or 10,000--

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:90%
not the typical remote viewer.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.307 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
be able to do that.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's still possible,
I want to add, as Rick--

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what
I was trying to--

00:18:23.073 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
because we would just get
a random number generator

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:90%
and put a number on--

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and we just say New Year's
Eve, 1980, fold that up,

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
target number, and
then you don't know

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:90%
what-- you just get the number.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way
they were teaching

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
us to do time levels because
it's very complicated if you

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
just tell the remote
viewer what you just said.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's still possible.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:10%
What people need
to keep in mind is

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:10%
that the future is based
upon probabilities,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:10%
so they might actually
remote view something that

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:10%
could have happened
in the future, which

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:10%
is a nice tense, though.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:10%
But it didn't come
into existence.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:10%
So that is something
that makes it hard,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.610 align:middle line:10%
but it's still possible.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:10%
And we know for a fact
that some remote viewers

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:10%
have used their capabilities
in order, for example,

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:10%
to influence the stock market
or gain from it and sports bets

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:10%
And these were
official programs.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:10%
So people from official
government projects

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:10%
used their
capabilities, and they

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:46.780 align:middle line:10%
made a fair amount of money
that went into those projects

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:10%
through that.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We have remote
viewed the moon, Mars,

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
an object that's
flying deep in spa--

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
or deep in our solar system
near Uranus and Neptune.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:84%
We remote viewed an alien
craft, something that-- while I

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:84%
was working at the Institute
for Advanced Studies privately,

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
not sanctioned by
the government.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It was private with private
former military remote viewers

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.280 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing an alien
craft that's flying.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
He described the interior of
the craft, the number of the ETs

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:84%
in the craft, where they
were sitting at councils,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:90%
how fast that craft was going.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We could see it
with a telescope.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:90%
We knew the craft was there.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:90%
NSA had been monitoring it.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
We have deep space probes
which is under the secret space

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And we identified that craft.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is some years ago.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:90%
So we knew it was there.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And this remote viewer was
able to remote view that.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We had remote viewers
that remote viewed--

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and I've done the
shows on Gaia before--

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:90%
on the structures on Mars.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:84%
He remote viewed
these structures.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:90%
They're all vacant now.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:84%
They're not inhabited
with anybody.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
But these structures had been
there for thousands of years.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So that obviously
means there was

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
a civilization on Mars thousands
and thousands of years ago.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And these structures
are still there.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one
particular structure

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:84%
has some types of crafts
on the bottom that

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:90%
looked like he drew--

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:84%
looked like helicopters or
small kind of flying devices.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But there was some distance
under the martian soil.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.310 align:middle line:90%
So we have done that.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:90%
We've remote viewed Jupiter.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:90%
That was a NASA remote viewer.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And again, NASA has
their own remote viewers

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that saw something swimming
under the moon of Europa,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:90%
that the surface is ice--

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Octopus?

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> --under that.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it looked like octopuses.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
He drew what it looked
like an octopus that

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.180 align:middle line:90%
was swimming under the ice.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:90%
So these things have happened.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> As remote viewers can
remote view a craft with

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial on there,
can the extraterrestrial remote

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:90%
view remote viewer?

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of our remote
viewers in the late '90s was

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:90%
doing something to that effect.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:84%
He was getting some kind
of energy or thoughts back,

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and he's thinking that
they're coming back

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:90%
from that particular craft.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Now he wasn't geared or
trained to understand

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:90%
what he was receiving.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But years later now, we jump to
2019 when he's sitting around,

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
something like just
talking to a bunch of us.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
He was convinced there then
that they connected with his--

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because he was connected to
them, they connected to him.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But he was upset that he didn't
follow through with that.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think that they have
the capability of doing that.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Tim, do you know if they can?

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we've
seen quite some time,

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and the phenomenon is there is
that whenever that is a craft

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.780 align:middle line:84%
or something and someone tries
to take a picture of it that

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
often there is a moment when the
technology is not working that

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So we assume that the
inhabitants of this

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:84%
are the people inside of the
craft somehow pick up on that

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and somehow influence
the technology.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
The phenomena are there very
indeed and very observable.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But we still don't quite
know how to interpret that.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Have any remote
viewing missions involved

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional beings?

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I know a couple of cases
where remote viewers are

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
on a target in a
foreign country,

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.790 align:middle line:90%
and they were reviewing an area.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's supposed to be some
military activities occurring.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is actually in China.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And what they saw
was not Chinese.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:90%
They saw something else.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:84%
He was so confused
at what he was seeing

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that he stopped the session.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
He told his handler who
was sitting next to him,

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm confused because
this target area

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have Chinese people.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:90%
It has some other type.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, he didn't
connect to ETs, OK?

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So his handler said, well, go
back in and try to pinpoint

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:90%
and look at what these were.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And when he did, he
saw them disappearing.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Like, they were going
through some portal.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, he didn't
explain it that way.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:84%
But later on when the
report-- because they generate

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:90%
reports on these.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.390 align:middle line:84%
The report was made
was that these things

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:90%
weren't Chinese soldiers.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
They were ETs in
that particular spot,

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
which would be in China, similar
to where our Area 51 would be.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Not disappearing in
a room or a building,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:90%
but they were just disappearing.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So we figured that that was some
portal into another dimension.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Cayce was a
great remote viewer.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Was he ever tasked by the
military to do any missions?

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard of one,
just one mission.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
classified that I really

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:84%
didn't have access
to other than he

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:90%
was successful in the mission.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But we did have
civilian remote viewers.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
programs in remote viewing

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:84%
which is still pretty
highly classified

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:84%
is the civilians, the civilians
outside the military that

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:90%
were natural remote viewers.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Probably one of the
best I've ever met

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
was a former school teacher in
Baltimore, Maryland, African

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
American lady who had a
natural ability to remote view.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.040 align:middle line:84%
She was out with her children
along Chesapeake Bay.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, she
had these strange visions

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:10%
of this big, huge
boat under the water,

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:10%
and she had no connection
to the military whatsoever.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:84%
None of her relatives
had been in the military.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Her ex-husband hadn't been--
so she knew very little

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
about the military.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:10%
But she knew in some way
that there was trouble.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:90%
So she didn't know what to do.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:90%
She just visualized it.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.545 align:middle line:84%
So she went home, and
she told her daughter.

00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter was seven
years old at the time.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I've seen this.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I close my eyes,
and I can see this.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, a few days later,
there was a US submarine that

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
was in Chesapeake Bay
that had problems,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and there was some
sailors on board

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that weren't getting the right
oxygen. So she had remote view.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
She saw that in the paper,
and she said, oh my gosh.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Why did I see this?

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So after a while, she became
a remote viewer and probably

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
one of the best because
she was natural.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have to go
through this protocol

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that remote viewers
have to go through that

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.315 align:middle line:84%
takes some time as
you know, Emery,

00:27:20.315 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:90%
to facilitate the target area.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
You just have to tell
her the target area,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:90%
and she does the rest.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And she draws probably better
than most remote viewers.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So there were civilians that
were involved in this program,

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably
still classified.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Is remote viewing being
used today by our militaries?

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
And if so, in what way?

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The program went from a
open unclassified program

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to a highly classified
special access program.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:90%
It's still occurring.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know all the details.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But I do know people within
this particular group at DIA

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that does facilitate
the remote viewing.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And they probably have
really perfected it now--

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe so

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> --than before.

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe there are
special interest groups out

00:28:17.102 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
there using remote viewing
to contact extraterrestrials?

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There are dozens
and dozens of them.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been contacted by a
number of them over the years,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:90%
wanting me to come in and join.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a remote viewer.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.775 align:middle line:90%
I've tried.

00:28:32.775 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I just don't have
the ability to do it.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there was a lot
of private groups out there.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
There are people like
Major Ed Dames who

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:90%
teaches this remote viewing.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's hundreds of
other people, former military

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.675 align:middle line:84%
and just former
private remote viewers

00:28:50.675 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:84%
who train and have
classes on remote viewing.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You can go to seminars
for remote viewing,

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and you can probably remote
view with two or three

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:90%
days of training some people.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And some people can't.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there's still
a lot out there,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and they are doing exactly what
they want to do is remote view

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:84%
the ETs or remote view the
UFOs or the other UAPs.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the private
organization CSETI,

00:29:18.285 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:84%
the Centers for Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:84%
with Steven Greer teaches
that, and they utilize it all

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:90%
the time to make contact.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> They have some people I've
met that were really dynamite

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:84%
remote viewers, and
they were civilians.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They'd never been
trained by the military.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's exactly
what they're doing.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The UAPs that we've
been seeing in the news,

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:84%
do you think there's a remote
viewing group that's been

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.988 align:middle line:84%
tasked just to find out
what those Tic Tacs are?

00:29:45.988 --> 00:29:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm sure they are.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know for a fact.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer connected
to that, but I can just

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:84%
guess that the military would
use every facet and every type

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:84%
of investigative tool they have
to investigate those things

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and try to determine
whether they're ours

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.150 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're
extraterrestrials.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.238 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure remote viewers
are right on that case.

00:30:10.238 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, in your line of work,
have you ever used remote

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:84%
viewing to make contact
with extraterrestrials?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:10%
Actually, we don't.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:10%
We haven't used the technology.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:10%
We had the luck
that communication

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:30.470 align:middle line:10%
was already established, so
it was direct communication.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we perceived in written
form was through technology.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I personally have bought
some material on it.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm quite interested in it
just to play around with it.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.810 align:middle line:90%
But no, we haven't used it.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Remote viewing, a
fascinating subject.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.568 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank Richard
for coming on the show.

00:30:52.568 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you very
much for having me.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And Tim, it's always
great to have you.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like I was
abandoned on the planet.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't belong in the planet.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And that they forgot
to pick me up.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.450 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted them to pick me up.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Once I was inside
the craft, I was

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:84%
held in a prone position in
the arms of another being that

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:90%
was tall.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said,
you have to go back.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You have a job to do, and it's
time for you to do that job.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.820 align:middle line:10%
