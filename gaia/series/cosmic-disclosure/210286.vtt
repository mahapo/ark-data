>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty--

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:10%
a retired
counterintelligence agent

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:10%
Also, joining us is Tim--

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:10%
a Tactical Advisor
to covert analysts

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:10%
trying to understand the
missions and strategies

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:10%
of non-human intelligences
on our planet.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm really excited
about today's episode

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
get into Antarctica,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and I want to start off first
by asking Tim to explain some

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
of the history of Antarctica
that you're aware of.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:10%
So every time I was
bored, I was looking

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:10%
into whatever documents I could
get my hands on and just read

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:10%
them because it portrays a
whole different other history

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:10%
compared to what you find
in the books, information

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.323 align:middle line:10%
that are different to the
conventional information.

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, than the
normal history.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So what do we know?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
We certainly, have
seen that there's

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:84%
the Nazis itself were
quite interested in, well,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
the search for
Atlantis and mysterious

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.790 align:middle line:90%
places all around the globe.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So they had missions
going to Egypt,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
had missions going
to Tibet, to India,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and they were looking
for things, whatever

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:90%
they could get their hands on.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
This is because Hitler, himself,
was very interested in finding

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
alternative history
facts because he

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
was interested in art as well,
and he was a collector himself.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Conventional history
shows that, as well,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that he had a big interest
in all these myths

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:90%
and secrets around the world.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:84%
We also know that there's a
second key player in the Third

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Reich that was kind of
opposing Hitler himself,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:90%
which was Himmler.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Himmler, himself, he grew
to the second man of power

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
in the Third Reich,
and over time,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
this SS state somehow

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
became a force in itself,
almost like the first breakaway

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
civilization that history
of this planet has ever had.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:10%
And it's quite
fascinating because he

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:10%
has done extensive
research, for example,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:10%
on witches and magic
powers, and that

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:10%
is what the documents
are indicating,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:10%
that some thousands of years
ago, Antarctica wasn't an ice

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:10%
place, but it was quite
Mediterranean in its climate

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:10%
because, at that time, the
pole shifts were different--

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:10%
the magnetic poles were
different on the planet

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:10%
so the weather was different.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:10%
And they arranged
the first mission

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:10%
down there, which was
done through a ship

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:10%
that they constructed only
for that particular case.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it was one
of the first aircraft

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:10%
carriers that was designed
just to explore Antarctica.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> What year was this?

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Early '30s.

00:03:29.907 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, 19--

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know it?

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> 1936.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, perfect.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:10%
Schwabenland, which was
the name of the ship,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:10%
and they had an aircraft
on it, where they

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:10%
could fly around Antarctica.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And no country in the
world at that time

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:90%
was interested in Antarctica.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were they so
obsessed with it, Tim?

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> For two reasons, basically.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
At a certain time in history,
Antarctica was populated,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and it might have
been a place that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
could have any kind of
significance to the Nazis

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
because they, at least
Himmler, believed very strongly

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:90%
in magic and psionic effects.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're looking for the
secrets, maybe some artifacts,

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
maybe some technology left
behind by this ancient

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And the second reason is
with the course of the war

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:84%
going less in favor for
the Nazis at that time,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
they were looking
for a remote base

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
where they could
potentially, do some things.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:10%
And what we've seen in the
documents is that they created

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.610 align:middle line:10%
a special class of U-boats,
which was called [NON-ENGLISH]

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:90%
actually, translated.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And so those submarines
were specially-designed.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They were the class that could
dive the deepest at that time.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:10%
What we've also seen
in the documents,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:10%
and we have that listed,
is the amount of material

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:10%
that they put down there--

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:10%
machinery, a whole terrain,
systems, technicians,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:10%
everything.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
They went from Germany down
to Antarctica so many times,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and in the process
of the World War,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:90%
even more and more and more.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:10%
And you have that
list that you can

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:10%
see all the material that
they brought down there,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:10%
which is immense.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:10%
They have brought
machinery down there

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:10%
in order to create steam
in order to create an igloo

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:10%
effect down in Antarctica.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:10%
We've also seen that
when the war in Europe

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:10%
seems to have come to an end,
there are some very interesting

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:10%
situations.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So some people might
say, yeah, Hitler might

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:90%
have gone down to Antarctica.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty convinced,
from what I've read,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that he died in the bunker
in Berlin, at that time.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
They've done pretty
extensive analysis

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
on the teeth and
the skull, which

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:90%
the Russians took to Moscow.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think
about that, Rick?

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I believe he died.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I believe he died.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You do?

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> He died in
Berlin in a bunker.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much evidence
that would show that he died.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were they launching a
disinformation campaign then,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
about maybe his
escape to Antarctica?

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Was it to control
the Germans or--

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I think, there's an element--

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
as Tim knows, there's an element
within Germany, the Nazi Party.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Although, it was
outlawed, there were still

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
so many supporters of the Nazi
Party right up until the '70s.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And they had to rearrange and
reconstruct their government

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
after the fall of 1945
because the United States

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
came in and abolished
the government,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:90%
so they had to recreate it.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that this
element of the Nazi Party

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
would still be, even in a
philosophical way, supportive.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I spent two semesters at
Mainz University in Germany,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and I studied German archives,
and the ironic thing about what

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
the Germans did to prepare
themselves for Antarctica was

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
the German government,
in the 1940s,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
was the first country to develop
synthetic clothing to insulate

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.940 align:middle line:90%
for cold.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:90%
It's similar to Gore-Tex.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The German government
perfected that.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, Germany, it doesn't
get that cold in Germany,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
even in Northern Germany,
so why would they--

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:90%
why would he do that?

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:84%
They made 6,000 pairs of
these insulated boots, which

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:84%
were given to, according to this
one document, stormtroopers.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Those stormtroopers
were the ones

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
that went on the ship,
the aircraft carrier,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:90%
to go to Antarctica.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
During the time period,
where the concentration camps

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
were in full operation,
German scientists

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
were trying to perfect
the superhuman,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and they were using
the concentration camp

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.875 align:middle line:90%
prisoners to do that.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They were injecting
them into all sorts

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
of things that
determine how they

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
can strengthen and
insulate their skin

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:90%
without heavy clothing.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
good information

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:10%
about missing concentration
camp prisoners.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
The Germans would come
in, put them on a train,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:90%
and they would go someplace.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.492 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't go to
the gas chambers,

00:08:57.492 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
they went someplace else,
and there's good evidence

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that they took them down to
Antarctica for experiments.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, jump ahead.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, as Tim said,
the German government

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
was the first one to set up an
expedition inside Antarctica,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and that was, I think, in
the 1936-1937 time frame.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
During the time
period of the war,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
there were 11 different
ships tracked--

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:84%
German cargo ships--
going in that direction.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Right after the war,
the USS, I believe

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
it was, the Montana
and another, which

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
was an aircraft carrier, I
believe, or a battleship,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and a US submarine tracked
two German submarines

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.700 align:middle line:84%
going in that direction, and
it was just after the war.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And the fleet Admiral
was asked, do we

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:90%
destroy these or let them go?

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And Admiral says,
just let them go.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:90%
The war's over with.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can jump ahead till now.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's so much talk
about what has happened down

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica over the years.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:90%
We have bases down there.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Germans have bases.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Russians have bases.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese have bases.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
In 1976, we know
this to be factual,

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
as far as most of
this information.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:84%
There are some of it that
is still questionable.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
The United States government
were perfecting weapon systems

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
back in those days, and
they perfected a weapon

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:90%
system called the Spartan--

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
now, I'm not going
to go into details

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:90%
of exactly what that was--

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and then a second
one called the ZEUS.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
They had to find a place to
test these weapon systems.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to do it
at the Nevada test site.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid of what damage
that this particular weapon,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the Spartan, which was the
first one tested, would do.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to do this down
in Antarctica, so they did.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They took it down there, they
fired two shots of this weapon

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.771 align:middle line:84%
into a tunnel that they
had built 1/2 a mile

00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:90%
into the underground.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:84%
18 months later, ZEUS was
the second weapon system,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:84%
entirely different
type of weapon system,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
but they fired that.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was in, I
believe, in 1978.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%
So they tested it.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was only one
shot, and there's some

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:90%
saying there was several shots.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, jump ahead several
years and an expedition

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
team from the US is flying
over a particular area

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and sees a big hole in
the ice in Antarctica,

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and they report it
back-- hey, there's

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:90%
a huge hole in this ice.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:90%
And this is some years later.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:90%
This is in the middle '80s.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to send a
ground team in the summertime

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
down there, in the
December time frame era,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:84%
just to figure
out what this was.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So they sent this team down
there, a seven-person team,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
they get to this tunnel,
they go into this tunnel,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and lo and behold, what, they
think, these weapon systems

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
cleared away and
left was a pyramid.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:90%
There's a pyramid down there.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> How big is this pyramid?

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.695 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know the dimensions.

00:12:20.695 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a wide
variety of dimensions

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of that particular person.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The man who claimed to be on
the expedition, who went down,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
he was Army person,
claimed it was--

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Giza.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.095 align:middle line:84%
>> --similar to
the one in Giza--

00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- and is a typical
Egyptian pyramid.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And so, the question
is, what is this pyramid

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:90%
doing under Antarctica?

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:90%
What is this doing down there?

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And now that opens to even
a wider range of discussions

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.220 align:middle line:90%
on what it could be.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have anything
to add to that, Tim?

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There are satellite pictures
that actually confirm what Rick

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
just said, and that is not the
only thing that can be seen

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and seems to appear
more and more.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Since the ice is slowly
melting in Antarctica,

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
we've also seen that there are
strange objects, potentially

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:90%
crafts, appearing as shadowy--

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Shadowy, OK.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --forms under the ice.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
From what I know, I
can also add that, one

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
of potentially, the
oldest space port

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:90%
is said to be found down there.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
what the Nazis

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:90%
were looking for in the 1940s.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Jump ahead now, to the
'90s, there was a particular

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:90%
expedition--

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
US expedition-- that went
down there supposedly,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:84%
to recover some
old artifacts that

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
were down there, and actually
found German artifacts,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:90%
uniforms, and so forth.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So that, pretty much,
established the fact

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans were
there at one point

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
because there was an old
base, wooden huts and so forth

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:90%
and German military uniforms.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really date
it, I don't believe.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But what they also found was
a craft, and that was in 1999.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
They found a craft, the
United States, the expedition.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, they didn't know
what to do with it.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
This particular 11-person
crew hadn't been told or even

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
briefed on anything
that they might find,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
other than artifacts--
leave them in place--

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
but when they find this craft
that's buried under the ice,

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:90%
they could see it.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.925 align:middle line:84%
And the ironic
part about that is,

00:14:48.925 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
when it became somewhat dark
during that time period--

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%
although, this was summertime--

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
there were lights going
off inside this craft.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:90%
So they didn't know what to do.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:84%
They were not
briefed, not prepared.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So they left.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
They sent another
team down there,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's very little
known about this other team,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:90%
as in recovery.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of stories that
has been circulated about it.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.097 align:middle line:90%
I know, Linda Howe has one.

00:15:13.097 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:90%
They brought it out.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It was only 15 feet
in diameter, but was

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.800 align:middle line:84%
really big on the
bottom, like, there

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of a container
on the bottom of it.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They brought it out.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
They had a heck of
a time getting it

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:84%
from that site, which I
believe was, like, 300

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.870 align:middle line:90%
miles away from McMurdo Base.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't do it by aircraft,
so they had to bring a ship--

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:90%
a container ship.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> They contracted a deep
salvage ship to come in to take

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that someplace, and I don't
know where they took it.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I assumed probably to Area
51, but if it was that long,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
the length of that was,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:84%
they probably would have had
problems of concealing that

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:90%
to a location.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it would have
fit on board an aircraft.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
What else can you
tell us about what

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
we learned about that pyramid
that was found down there?

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Boy, that's a question
that I would love to know all

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
the answers to.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
compartmented, so to speak,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and there's very
little information.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I know people have come
forth on different programs

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and talked about it.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
The special military team,
the guy that claimed it--

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
he was on a first team and
now he's on the second team.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
He claims that when they
went down into that--

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.855 align:middle line:84%
to the cavern,
where this pyramid

00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
was situated, that it was
green, plush metal down there.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, the area
around the pyramid,

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
the base of the pyramid,
was green, for some reason.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, if this is buried
under Antarctica,

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
how could it be green?

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
What--

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Like algae or--

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's, like, algae.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, and he describes
that, but he also--

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:84%
the team that went down there,
they were only down there

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:84%
for, like, 30 minutes or
so-- a short period of time--

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and they felt sick and dizzy.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:90%
So they had to go back up.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
Once they got away from the
pyramid, they felt all right.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So now, that
presented a problem.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
What kind of protective clothing
do you need to get down there?

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, he tells this
story, and I hate

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to repeat what he's saying
because I don't know if it's

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:84%
factual or not,
right but he said

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
they had to get in actually
Level A hazmat suits--

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, sure.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> --which did protect them from
whatever the ray or waves or--

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And energy.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> --energy that was down
there-- yeah, probably energy.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't find an
entrance into the pyramid,

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:90%
so it was just there.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And his team went out, and they
brought in other scientists,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and he said then, he doesn't
know what happened after that.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's very little you can
find out, even on the internet.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know Linda Howe and
others have talked about it--

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what it was for.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Who built it?

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Maybe Tim would know?

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>> What do we know?

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.950 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
planet itself goes

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
through certain cycles
of civilizations, which

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:84%
means before we have this
human species on the planet,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:84%
there is some kind of
forgotten civilization

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that goes back to a different
version, a previous cycle

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:90%
of this planet.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
We can see that the
magnetic field of Earth

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
has shifted in
some way, as well.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:90%
They are all gone.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:90%
They're all gone.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about, in
South America, about 80

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
million houses and buildings
that could give home to people,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't ever found
skeletons or people there.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So there are not only
pyramids in Egypt,

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:84%
but they are all over
the place on the planet.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And the way we understand it
is that all these pyramids,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
they create some kind
of electric current,

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and they connect all these
cities around the globe

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:84%
so that people could
benefit from the energy that

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:90%
came from those pyramids.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But since we know that there
was some kind of civilization,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
people in Antarctica when it
was a Mediterranean location,

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:84%
they also have
built this pyramid.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And they had a space
port, even, in order

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to make direct contact with ETs
and different other species,

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.865 align:middle line:84%
And we see clear
evidence, even today,

00:19:57.865 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient places for that.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Do we know who that was,
and how they looked?

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
No, we don't because
they're gone.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no trace of them.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if they
were human or something,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:90%
or how they looked.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We just know what they left
and that they were there

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
and that they went on.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably
going to happen

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
with this version of this
plant as well, at some time.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they ever put a
date on that civilization

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica?

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we can clearly define
time for about 15,000 years.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:84%
If we go earlier
than that, we see

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that we have too many different
observable perspectives on time

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
so we get some kind of
paradox, where things

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:90%
don't seem to fall into place.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And even if we go
way back, then we

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
see that it's getting
illogical even more.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So that is a problem, and
the way I would define it

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
is that, reality itself comes
in cycles on this planet--

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:10%
>> --which means that we're
probably talking about

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:10%
a version--

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.065 align:middle line:10%
at least, this is the
way we speak about it--

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:10%
a previous version of Earth,
where we cannot put a time

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:10%
stamp on it.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Another interesting
aspect about this pyramid--

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
prior to it being
found, there were

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of UFO sightings
occurring down there.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a person that spent
the winters down there.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
There's just a skeleton team at
McMurdo, of the United States

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
base, that stays down
there during their winter,

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:41.685 align:middle line:90%
would be our summer--

00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:42.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:21:42.485 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --just to maintain
equipment and so forth.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was a scientist,
a botanist, I believe,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and he would talk about these
strange lights occurring

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:90%
that would be flying over.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, he knew there wasn't
any aircraft coming in.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing from
Earth that could fly around

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:84%
during a particular time during
their winters down there,

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:90%
but he saw these lights.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
He never saw them
in the summertime.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.350 align:middle line:84%
He never saw them in the
December time frame area.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:90%
He only saw them in the winter.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, they could
fly in all weather.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure that was--

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
they could fly, regardless
of what the weather is.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to hide
themselves from us,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they were
visiting that pyramid.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's other stories about
lights coming out of the ice.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, could it
have been, also,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
an alien reproduction
vehicle made by the Germans?

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I haven't heard.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I know, we-- we, United
States government, got,

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:84%
during the time frame
of just after the war,

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
we brought a number
of German scientists

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:10%
And one of the documents,
a very interesting document

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:10%
that I read while I was
at Mainz University,

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:10%
was a document written by
a particular scientist,

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:10%
and it talks about how
to travel in space.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And it has a phrase
"space travel."

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is 1944 that was
written-- this document was

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.625 align:middle line:90%
written, in 1944.

00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's impressive, yeah.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you can't find any
other reference to space travel

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:84%
in any other kind of
documents that I've ever seen,

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm, pretty much, a
military history buff.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So what did they know
about space travel then,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't know about?

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Was there a possibility
that a craft prior to 1947--

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
my time frame--

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
my timeline starts-- but was
there a craft before 1947

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans recovered, and
they were experimenting with?

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the technology
wasn't advanced enough

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
for maybe them to understand it,
but maybe they were trying to.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, the bell, that we hear--

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> About so often,
that's in Germany,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.190 align:middle line:90%
maybe that was an ET craft.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would be interested to
know what you think of that?

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the SS was
the first military brand

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that has a special department
for looking into UFO

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:90%
cases, which is, at least--

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:90%
so CIA was founded in 1947.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It was, I guess, 1942 when the
SS had a full organized section

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
for looking into those cases.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So they basically knew there
is reality to the UAP and UFO

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
phenomena, and they were
interested in getting

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:90%
their hands on it.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Did they make contact?

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
At least, I don't know.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that they were
interested in remote viewing

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
much earlier than the CIA
ever got their hands on it.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So they had a
department for that,

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and this was totally
normal to them.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:84%
No reason at all for
ridicule or something.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.920 align:middle line:84%
They had a special department
for remote viewing submarines

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
in the World War II in
the Navy, in Germany.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So they did that, and they
pinpointed all these US

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:90%
American boats.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Later on, the Allies got their
hands on the radar system,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
which made things a
lot easier, but that

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:90%
was the way the Germans did it.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.572 align:middle line:84%
They used pendulums
in order to find them,

00:25:34.572 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and they were
successful with that.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we know is there
were groups that were trying

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to remote view information,
and we assume that they got all

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
the information they needed to
build a functional flying alien

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:84%
craft through remote
viewing those technology.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And they build it, and
basically, operation High Jump,

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
we see that
potentially, the Germans

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
have finished their own
working fleet two years later.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> The ironic--

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Tim spoke about this earlier--
ironic thing about Hitler

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
was he was so fascinated
with the psychic research,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:84%
psychic phenomena, the
paranormal side of it

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that he sent SS operatives
all over the world

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:90%
to collect whatever he could.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
He had his own psychic
advisor, and we

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:84%
know from the history
of remote viewing--

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
of course, they
didn't actually call

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:84%
it remote viewing
back in those days,

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
but it was a form
of remote viewing--

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the history of
remote viewing talks

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:84%
about the German program
in 1941 up to 1944

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:90%
about remote viewing.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:90%
And they also talk about--

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Himmler actually spoke
with one of his generals,

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and there is a private--

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:84%
it's in the Archives--
there's a letter of talking

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:84%
about Himmler's conversation
with this other German general,

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is in late '44,
right up and maybe into '45.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it was dated
February of 1945.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:15.070 align:middle line:84%
The letter was about
all the magic weapons

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:90%
that we need to relocate.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't mention where
or doesn't mention anything

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.698 align:middle line:84%
about that, but,
as Tim said, they

00:27:22.698 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:90%
had to get them out of Germany.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I think, Himmler
knew, and as several

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of the other German generals
knew that the war was going--

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
coming to the end, they
weren't going to survive,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:84%
the Third Reich wasn't
going to survive,

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.750 align:middle line:90%
so they had to move things out.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Now-- and there's another
plan about the Fourth Reich

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and where they were going to set
up base and counter all this,

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
but anyways, where did they
take all these magic weapons?

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I can remote view it.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Antarctica.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's Antarctica.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So now, I have a
question for you, Rick.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Are there still Nazis down
in Antarctica, nowadays?

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a good-
that's a good question.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.443 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to hear
your opinion on that.

00:28:01.443 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's hard.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, what I've read
and what I've studied--

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.440 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of it is conjecture.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:90%
I can't say for a fact.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've spoken to a
lot of people about this--

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
is there a subterranean
civilization down there?

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of evidence.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's photographs--

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
some guy had a website
with all these photographs,

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and he could have made
them up, I don't know,

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
but it showed a civilization
under Antarctica-- deep

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:84%
under Antarctica, actually,
supposedly, under this pyramid.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And if there were, I think,
obviously, the relatives--

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:84%
the people that are
alive down there

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:84%
would be relatives of the
Nazis, the former generals,

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:50.230 align:middle line:84%
because in the administrative
control of the world,

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
that document that Hitler had
mentioned or wrote-- somebody

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
else wrote it for him,
"How to Conquer the World,"

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember
exactly-- you

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
know what I'm talking
about, that document-- he

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.162 align:middle line:90%
talks about Antarctica.

00:29:03.162 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he talks
about the North Pole.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:90%
He talks about Canada.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:84%
He talks about-- he didn't go
great deal in the United States

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.790 align:middle line:90%
because he doesn't--

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.480 align:middle line:84%
even though Hitler was
irrational at times,

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.580 align:middle line:84%
he was a rational
person knowing,

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:84%
an invasion of the United States
probably wouldn't have worked,

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.162 align:middle line:84%
but Canada, he thought,
could be invaded and Mexico,

00:29:22.162 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and he had them on
top of the list.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But he also talked
about Antarctica--

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
how to build a
community in Antarctica.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, this was an--

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:90%
his early reign, but who knows?

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:90%
There could be.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> 2014, '15, '16, '17, and on,
we have had reports of world

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
leaders, religious leaders
visiting Antarctica,

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:90%
even the astronauts.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Our president has been there.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe it's the pyramid.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It's definitely a show
and tell of something.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's absolutely, absolutely,
a show and tell of something.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> They want everyone to know.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.122 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, that in 2013,
two representatives from

00:30:00.122 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
the Vatican went down there--

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> --and they spent a
lot of time down there.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They were taken on expeditions.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say
where, but where would

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:90%
you think they would be taken?

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I think, from 1999, when
we discovered the pyramid,

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:22.300 align:middle line:84%
until 2013, there's been a
lot of advanced exploration

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:90%
of that pyramid.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.860 align:middle line:84%
We probably figured out
how to get in there,

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:84%
we probably figured out how
to get around down there,

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and what we discovered
down there probably

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.090 align:middle line:90%
would amaze everyone.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think they brought
the religious leaders

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:90%
and other world--

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I know representatives from
a lot of different countries

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:90%
who went down there in 2015.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.210 align:middle line:84%
They had that big
thing down there--

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.400 align:middle line:84%
but they haven't
shared it with us, yet.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>> No, right.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Their lips are sealed.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you think's going
on down there in, Tim?

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't it rare, that they
bring all these politicians

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:84%
down to Antarctica, and no
one cared for Antarctica until

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:84%
the treaty and before Operation
High Jump, and suddenly,

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:90%
everyone is interested.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.900 align:middle line:90%
I can only assume.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I think, if there's,
indeed, a civilization,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and there are rumors
going on that nations--

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's
secretive contracts,

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.272 align:middle line:90%
which United Nations--

00:31:26.272 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I think you can't even
join the United Nations

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:84%
if you don't sign that
treaty, that you will not

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:90%
go to Antarctica.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that true?

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're not--

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.190 align:middle line:90%
yeah, you won't.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So if the rumors are correct,
that they have acknowledged

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:84%
the existence of a
Fourth Reich down there

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and they must not tell some--

00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
nobody, basically-- then, maybe,
some of these meetings that we

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:08.470 align:middle line:84%
have seen, in order to prepare
for disclosure all around

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.190 align:middle line:84%
the world-- in Africa,
Australia, Belgium,

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:90%
United States, Canada--

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe they have also
taken place in Antarctica,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.632 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know.

00:32:22.632 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my real good friends,
who passed away a few years

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:25.975 align:middle line:90%
ago, Robert Dean--

00:32:25.975 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Sergeant Major of the Army--

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.540 align:middle line:84%
he was a UFO researcher,
a real good close

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:90%
friend of Wendelle Stevens.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:84%
What he said-- he died
a couple of years ago,

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:84%
but he talked quite
openly about--

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and what he said, that he
found out from a source,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:90%
was there was a portal--

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:84%
a time portal--
in Antarctica, and

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.430 align:middle line:84%
the first or second expedition
that actually found the pyramid

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:03.030 align:middle line:84%
went through that portal
into some other dimension.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:84%
All of them managed
to get back out,

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
but can you imagine, if we
found a portal in Antarctica,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.970 align:middle line:84%
either at the pyramid
or near the pyramid,

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:84%
that could take us into
a different dimension

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
or different time
warp or something else

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:90%
that we might not understand?

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what
that would mean?

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And that may be why
a lot of countries

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:84%
have to sign that they're
not going to go down there

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.445 align:middle line:84%
because there's some kind
of danger down there.

00:33:35.445 --> 00:33:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll tell you something.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I've seen documents where they
have brought an immense amount

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:45.660 align:middle line:84%
of so-called live
born children, which

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
was the program of the
Nazis for gifting children

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to the fuhrer and the country,
and we have seen the lists.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:84%
They have brought an immense
amount of these children

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:84%
down to Antarctica,
with no relatives,

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:84%
no one would miss
them, no traces.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.659 align:middle line:90%
They've deleted all the traces.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And we've also seen
documents that they

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:17.280 align:middle line:84%
have brought a group
of female psychologists

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
down there because
it indicates that--

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:90%
what you are talking about--

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:84%
could have been found by the
Nazis down there already,

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and they are talking about
strange phenomena down there,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and they need those
psychologists,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.179 align:middle line:84%
in the papers, where they demand
their need for psychologists

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:90%
in the Navy, which is rare.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You normally don't have
female psychologists

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:90%
on a naval ship at that time.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.949 align:middle line:84%
Hitler, basically, he was
against female soldiers

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
or females on naval ships, and
they brought them down as well

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.760 align:middle line:84%
because they said,
"there are reality" --

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm quoting here--
"reality-shifting effects down

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.810 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica," and they
need those psychologists.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.103 align:middle line:90%
>> That could be the portals.

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the portal-- yeah.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the portal thing.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Dean had some
statements about that portal,

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:90%
that some of our people went in.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:90%
It affected them.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.225 align:middle line:84%
They did get out,
according to him,

00:35:19.225 --> 00:35:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's according
to his sources,

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:84%
but that could be
why the Germans,

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.280 align:middle line:84%
when they established their
base down there in the 1936

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
to 1937 time frame,
they found it.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If they have found a UFO
and a pyramid down there,

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that's something they would
keep super secret, but yet,

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:84%
they're parading all
these politicians,

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.060 align:middle line:84%
religious leaders down
there to check it out.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if I was running
some kind of an intelligence

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:84%
operation or some form of a
briefing program to get money

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:58.200 align:middle line:84%
or to get cooperation from other
governments or other entities,

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I could see how they could
bring them down there,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:84%
give them a little
bit of information,

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.040 align:middle line:84%
but not tell them
the entire story.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, just to keep their
interest and maybe get money--

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the funding.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> --funding or cooperation
because let's face it.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.750 align:middle line:84%
No country has unlimited
funds, and so we

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:84%
want cooperation from
different entities and so--

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.380 align:middle line:84%
different countries, and
we have the representatives

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.420 align:middle line:84%
from Vatican, pretty rich, and
other countries down there.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact
list of the countries,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
other than Germany I know and
Canada and some other countries

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.528 align:middle line:84%
So I would manufacture
an operation

00:36:42.528 --> 00:36:44.820 align:middle line:84%
to bring them down, give them
a little bit of briefing,

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:84%
give them a little
bit of information,

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:84%
but not tell them all,
and maybe give them

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.482 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of a
real information

00:36:50.482 --> 00:36:51.690 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of disinformation--

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Disinformation, right.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:56.220 align:middle line:10%
>> --because in an operation,
a counterintelligence operation

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:10%
or a counter
espionage operation,

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:10%
or any kind of
intelligence operation,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:10%
you want to give a little
bit of good stuff with a lot

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:10%
of the bad stuff, so it
piques their interest.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And, I think, that's
probably what we are doing.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I agree with that.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's summarize
what we've talked about

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and maybe add a little bit
of the future of Antarctica.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, we know
the Germans went down there.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I know, we know their
base was established.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.210 align:middle line:90%
We've established bases.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.010 align:middle line:90%
We've tested weapons down there.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
We opened up some
cavern under the ice.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:90%
We've located a pyramid.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do we do?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.260 align:middle line:90%
We experiment.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:90%
We research.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.410 align:middle line:84%
We find the answers
to that pyramid.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.360 align:middle line:90%
What's the future?

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we did find a
portal down there,

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and now we're trying
to dictate what

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:84%
the future's going to bring to
mankind through that portal.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent, excellent.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, gentlemen, what an
astounding show this has been.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.453 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward to
doing some more with it.

00:37:54.453 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Rick, thank you so much
for being on the show.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.037 align:middle line:84%
>> And Tim, it's always
a pleasure having you.

00:37:59.037 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith and,
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.162 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Next, on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had access to
information pertaining

government.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:84%
This person will come
out six hours later

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and thought they were only
in there for 20 minutes.
