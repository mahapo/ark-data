>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:10%
intelligence.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're talking
about a UFO landing

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
at a remote satellite
tracking station.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Good to be here, Emery.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's a
highly isolated island

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
with a French satellite
tracking station on it.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
What UFO-related incident
took place on this island?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the island
is called Kerguelen Island.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the most remote island,
inhabited island in the world.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It's in the South Indian Ocean.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about 2,700 miles
southwest of Perth, Australia,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:90%
very isolated.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How remote is this?

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Extremely remote.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
way to this island.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:84%
It's by a ship that travels
from a southern point of South

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Africa to the island.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:90%
It takes 9 days to get there.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's a French-owned island.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It has a satellite
tracking station

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:90%
run by the French military.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
group of scientists that

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:90%
are on that island year-round.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So the total population of
that island at any given time

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:90%
is about 150 people.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What happened
on November 10, 1981?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: On November
10, 1981, Pine Gap

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
which is a joint American
and Australian tracking

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:84%
station near Alice
Springs, Australia

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
identified on radar a number
of unidentified flying objects

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:90%
flying up from Antarctica.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, immediately, the Australian
Air Force was notified of this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and they launched some
Mirage III fighter jets.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:10%
Back in those days, Australians
flew French-made fighter jets.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And these fighter Jets went
out to intercept these UFOs.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But these UFOs are flying
at such random altitudes

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
such as 60,000 feet and then
they would drop to 20,000 feet,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:84%
go all the way up
to 100,000 feet

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and then drop all the
way down to 6,000 feet.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.017 align:middle line:84%
The Mirage jets just couldn't
keep up with these UFOs.

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They are
not capable of that.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're not capable
of flying at that altitude

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:90%
or in that type of manner.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
The Mirage jets
quickly ran out of fuel

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and had to return to the base.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But some of these
UFOs were still

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:90%
being tracked by Pine Gap.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Some flew south towards
Antarctica and disappeared.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Some flew west, some flew north.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
One particular
one that flew west

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
landed in the ocean
south of Perth.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
A fishing ship located
in that area sent

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
out a mayday, a distress
call to the Australian Coast

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Guard saying some kind
of object had just

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
landed in the ocean
in front of him

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was causing such
havoc with the water

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that it was almost
capsizing this fishing ship.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:90%
So they asked for help.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But it was about 200
miles south of Perth,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
so no Australian Coast
Guard ship was in the area.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
But the captain of this
ship kept calling mayday

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
They asked for any other
assistance in the area.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, lo and behold, we had
some US Navy ships in the area

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
on classified operations
or classified missions.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ships went to
assist this fishing vessel.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But before it could
get there, this craft

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
had come out of
the water and flew

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:90%
in a south-westerly direction.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
About 20 hours later,
scientists on Kerguelen Island

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
sent out a distress call to
Perth asking for assistance

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
because a UFO has just landed
in the bay of this community.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It was on the
surface of the water,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
according to the reports, and
it didn't go under the water,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
it was just on the
surface of the water.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.383 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists on
the island needed help.

00:04:36.383 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
how to handle it.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.080 align:middle line:10%
All their support
came from Australia.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
If there was any kind
of medical emergency,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
it would come from Australia,
so they immediately

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
asked the Australian Coast
Guard for assistance.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's 2,700
miles from Perth,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:90%
the nearest port to the island.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:10%
And there's no ship that was
available except for the ships

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:10%
in the traffic lane, the
shipping lanes, or the US

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:10%
military ships that were already
there or near the island,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:10%
but still they were hours away.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The flight time from Perth
to the Kerguelen Islands

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:84%
was such that no
plane could fly there

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
without refueling,
air refueling.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
They could get there but
they could never go back.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was no runway
at Kerguelen Island.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So all ships would come
and dock in a harbor

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and then small shuttle
boats would take him

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
in to shore because
the port wasn't

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:90%
deep enough for big ships.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And since there was no runway,
the only planes that could land

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:84%
would be planes that
could land on the water.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're
out there all alone,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of communication,
but really no one's

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:90%
going to come.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And the US military
ships were hours away.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And I think some--

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I think the admiral told
me about 20 hours away.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, the
USS Hammerhead,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:90%
which was a submarine, arrived.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, the name of the ship
initially in this report

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:10%
was classified because it was
on a classified operation,

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:10%
but it's been identified now.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It arrived on scene
but it's a submarine,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:84%
it's not a surface ship,
so it couldn't really

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:90%
help too much there.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
But at the time the USS
Hammerhead got there,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.540 align:middle line:84%
this object was under the water,
somewhere under the water.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So they began
tracking this object

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.357 align:middle line:90%
moving around under the water.

00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In the bay.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In the bay
or around the island.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they tracked it
for a number of hours.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, a surface
ship, a USS surface ship,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
arrived on scene along with an
Australian Coast Guard cutter.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
The Australian
Coast Guard cutter

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
just had small arms
on board and rescue

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
helicopter, a helicopter
that could shuttle people

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So as the submarine, USS
submarine was following this,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:90%
it disappeared.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So for hours, they
couldn't find it.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, they got the
message from the USS destroyer

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:10%
that this object had
landed on the island.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's on the island
near the settlement

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:84%
where the scientists and
military personnel were.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some
remote locations

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that scientists spend some time
at but there's only really one

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:90%
port.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And the port has all the
facilities to maintain

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.338 align:middle line:90%
the people that are there.

00:07:41.338 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it was
the destroyer that

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
actually found where it went,
not the tracking station

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:90%
or Pine Gap.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
It had landed in the island
at a somewhat remote area.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And the destroyer was trying
to communicate with the island.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
according to the admiral,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a communications
problem between radio

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:90%
frequencies and so forth.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.087 align:middle line:84%
But when they
finally managed it,

00:08:05.087 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
they'd be able to
communicate with the Navy,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and the Navy communicate
with the island,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
then the scientists in the
island say this thing is here

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and there's two
entities, humanoids

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:90%
that are out of the craft.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know what to do.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the USS destroyer
was miles away.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They did have the ability to
aboard the island or board

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:90%
a ship.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
They had trained US Marines
on board, but it was--

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:90%
they were still--

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Still too far away.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --some distance away.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The submarine was
still in the harbor

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
but the submarine
couldn't do anything.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists on
the islands attempt

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
these humanoids.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Two of the scientists
approached the humanoids

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and tried to communicate.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
They spoke French,
German, and English.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And these humanoids didn't
seem to understand anything.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
They just stood there in front
of him, not making any sounds

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or doing anything other
than looking at each other.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, one
of the scientists

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:84%
who was from Denmark, a Danish
scientist and oceanographer,

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:84%
came over and then tried to do
telepathy with the humanoids.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
That somewhat worked
because he was saying,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting messages from him.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They're saying they
want something from us.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:90%
They kept asking for something.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But I don't understand
what they're asking me for.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They're asking for
me for a word, a word

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:90%
that I don't understand.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the
scientists got so upset

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
the other scientists had
to come and take him away.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.132 align:middle line:84%
So still, nobody knows what
these two humanoids wanted.

00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they're
just standing there.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're
just standing there.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they went
back into their craft

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:90%
and the craft took off.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it flew out
towards the ocean.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
The USS destroyer went after
it, saw it land in the water,

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
went after it, trying
to identify it.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, there
was two Mirage jets

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:90%
that made it over to this area.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
They had to dispatch
a refueling vehicle

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:84%
from an airbase
inside Australia,

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
but they were able to come on
station or come on the scene.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
As the two Mirage jets were
flying over this flying saucer,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
which was on the
surface of the ocean,

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:90%
it was moving on top, not under.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But at a high speed
because the destroyer is

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:90%
following it.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Right, it wasn't
going at a high speed.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It was just traveling
slowly according

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to the admiral along the ocean
in a northerly direction.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:84%
As a Mirage jets strafed it
or came down close to it,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
a beam of light hit
one of the Mirage jets.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
It disabled it enough where
the pilot was able to eject,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.820 align:middle line:90%
but the Mirage jet crashed.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the USS destroyer
considered that the hostile act

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and fired on the surface vessel
which was the flying saucer.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:84%
They hit it with a number
of different ordnance

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and munitions and I don't
know the exact type.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
The admiral didn't go
into details on it.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the destroyer was
able to hit it and it sank.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this particular
area, there's

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
shelves of the ocean,
some that go down 600 feet

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and some that go
down 11,000 feet.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And this craft ended up
going all the way down

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:90%
to the 11,000 feet.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, but it was
moving really slowly

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
so USS Hammerhead was
able to follow it,

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
got up really close to
it, and was reporting back

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that the flying saucer
had been heavily damaged

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and is taking on
water and is sinking.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But the USS
Hammerhead could only

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:90%
go down to a certain depth.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Submarines had a limit.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How large
is this craft?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: This craft is about
a football-sized craft.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Size of a football field size.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So then they couldn't
do anything but--

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
the USS Hammerhead couldn't
do anything but leave

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and resurface and stayed
next to the destroyer.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So now, they don't
know what to do.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:84%
They sank it, it's down at the
bottom of the ocean, the Navy

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:90%
protected.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.980 align:middle line:90%
In the meantime, they went--

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
the US Navy and the
Australian Coast Guard ship

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
launched a helicopter to
rescue the French, the pilot.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:90%
They got him out of the water.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.460 align:middle line:84%
He was unhurt but the
plane was totaled.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned their
high technology, even able

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
to stop bullets at some points.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think they
were not able to get out

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.778 align:middle line:84%
of this situation of being
bombarded by the Navy ships?

00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- we can't answer it.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't answer, the admiral
never did answer it.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
He just thought that
maybe their force field,

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only thing
we can compare a protection

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
device around the craft,
would be a force field.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their force
field wasn't working.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the craft was
already damaged somehow

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't able
to defend themselves.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they
thought this aircraft,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
this Mirage III Australian
plane was going to harm them.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Another thing the admiral
said is, who's next?

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:90%
They shot down a plane.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Is one of the ships next?

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
We can't take that chance so
we had to defend ourselves

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and we were able to sink it.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:90%
We were able to damage it.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:90%
How we did that, I don't know.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their force field was
down or their protection system

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:90%
was down.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, they have a dilemma.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So messages, as admiral
told me, flash messages,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
meaning top secret,
urgent messages

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:84%
was going from the
ships to Pearl Harbor

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, back and
forth, back and forth.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And the admiral was in a
position at Pearl Harbor

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.208 align:middle line:84%
to read these messages that
were coming back and forth.

00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What were they saying?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And urgent messages
saying, what do we do?

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
We just shot down an
extraterrestrial craft.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.267 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to handle that?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And what their main
concern was retaliation.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:31.272 align:middle line:84%
Now, Pine Gap had told them that
there were between 30 and 50--

00:14:31.272 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't count all of
them, but there were at least 30

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and 50 UFOs that they
spotted the day before

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
or a day and a half before that
was flying up from Antarctica.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So now, they're figuring,
we just shot down

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:90%
or we just sunk a UFO.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Did they send out a message or
an urgent mayday themselves?

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And now, are we going to
be attacked by other UFOs?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And this was their
primary concern.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:10%
So what the Navy did was they
sent all the air, all the ships

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:10%
in that area, that
they could get there

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:10%
in a reasonable amount of
time according to the admiral,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:10%
down there, including
the USS Kitty

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.620 align:middle line:10%
Hawk which was an aircraft
carrier with airplanes

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:10%
on board.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:10%
So eventually, over a
period of 14 to 15 hours,

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:10%
there was 6 or 7 ships
that got to the scene.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were setting
up just in case

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
they were going to have
to do battle with the ETs.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Only one came back.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
One came over and flew
around, never made,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:84%
according to admiral,
never made any hostile acts

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
or didn't shoot at any
of these surface ships.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But it stayed in the area
for a long time period,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
flying really low over
the different ships.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.550 align:middle line:84%
When the Kitty Hawk got
there, which had aircrafts,

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:84%
the Kitty Hawk
launched two aircrafts.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.262 align:middle line:90%
And I believe they were A-4s.

00:16:05.262 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A-4 Phantoms, right.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: A-4, and
anyways, they took off

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.910 align:middle line:90%
and they trailed this UFO.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost as if the UFO
was letting them trail them.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't trying to outfly
them, got real close

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
to the two Navy
airplanes but never

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:90%
showed any kind of hostilities.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But never tried to
fly away from them.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the A-4s
had to go back and land

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and there were other
planes that came up.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:90%
It was if there was--

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:84%
at first, the captain of
the carrier group on board

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
the Kitty Hawk
thought that they're

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with us.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're doing it.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They're waiting, right.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're
waiting, and they're

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with us.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:90%
So let's try to communicate.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So they were using all sorts of
hailing frequencies and radio

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:84%
frequencies and everything
they could think of.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't get
any contact with them.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, well, let's
try to do telepathy somehow.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:84%
So pilots were flying
around trying to mind-meld,

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, with
this alien ship

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and that wasn't working either.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But the alien craft is
staying in the exact same area

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
as if maybe guarding their
buddies who were down

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.042 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:17:27.042 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, we're days into
this, correct, at this point?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, we're in about
96 hours into this now.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the third
day, another UFO came in.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And what this did was hit
the water and went down.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.188 align:middle line:84%
So we figured they're
going to try to rescue

00:17:45.188 --> 00:17:46.230 align:middle line:90%
their buddies down there.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:84%
This is what the admiral is
saying everybody consensus.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.012 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to move back.

00:17:51.012 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move back
and let them do their thing.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
interfere with anything.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, some time
period, hour or so, that vessel

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the UFO came up and
flew away, and then

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
the other one then flew away.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, they
thought, well, OK, there's

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:90%
nothing down there.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they rescued
their buddies.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
be here anymore.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But the Navy of
Pearl Harbor sent

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
messages back saying, no,
no, no, no, we want that.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:90%
We want that craft.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to send a
salvage team down there.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So over a period of
the next 15 days,

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:84%
they stood around there, waited
there, brought other ships in,

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and they brought a big
salvage ship in from,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.063 align:middle line:90%
I think, it was from Long Beach.

00:18:38.063 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
determined that, Rick,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
what the United
States seems to be

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
in charge of this mission,
because Australia was there,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.048 align:middle line:90%
why did we take the precedence?

00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think we took
the precedence because we

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:90%
had overwhelming odds here.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:84%
We had more ships there
than the Australians did.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.348 align:middle line:84%
I think that eventually,
the Australians got

00:18:56.348 --> 00:18:57.640 align:middle line:90%
some of their Navy ships there.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But one other country
that assisted us there

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:90%
was a Japanese freighter.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a Japanese
defense warship,

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
it was a Japanese freighter that
offered assistance not knowing

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
exactly what was going on there
other than the airplane had

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
crashed, they knew that
an airplane had crashed.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.725 align:middle line:84%
But the Japanese didn't know
anything other than that.

00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:90%
So they were there to help.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Hey, we're here.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:90%
We're a freighter.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you want.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And we just let them hang around
there but we were in charge.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So that somebody,
the powers that

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
be in the Pentagon
or Pearl Harbor

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:84%
decided we wanted to
recover whatever's

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
down there, so we're going
to do a recovery operation.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's when the recovery
operation occurred.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that didn't go too
well because, number one,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't find it.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:90%
They can't find it.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:84%
They knew it was damaged
but they can't find it.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They figured it might have
imploded, they don't know.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But almost a month into
this, we're in a month

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
into this, all of a sudden this
huge round capsule surfaces.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Right in the middle of all
these ships, in fact, almost

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
hitting the bulkhead
of the USS Kitty Hawk.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So they brought in
a ship with a crane

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.710 align:middle line:90%
and brought this big object up.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.762 align:middle line:90%
It's a big ball.

00:20:18.762 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How big is the ball?

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:20.803 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: A huge ball.

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Probably a size of a semi-truck,
a commercial motor vehicle

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:90%
truck.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And they put it on the
deck of the USS Kitty Hawk

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:90%
with Marines guarding it.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
They looked inside and saw two
extraterrestrial creatures.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, they figured, oh maybe
this was the rescue vessel

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that might have came up
from this down craft that

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
was down there.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what it was.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, what is this?

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But they connected
it to the one that crashed.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.792 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, they don't
know what to do with it.

00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:84%
They can't-- they
couldn't open it.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They tried everything
possible, try to open it.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But they saw that these two
entities inside, these ETs

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:90%
were alive.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.280 align:middle line:90%
They were moving.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:90%
They were breathing.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:90%
They were moving.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So they knew they
were all right.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It was transparent?

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.235 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It was transparent.

00:21:11.235 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:90%
They could see through it, yes.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:90%
So eventually, it opened.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.162 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and they
took these two--

00:21:18.162 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
describe how it opened?

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Was there--

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It just opened with some
water in it, the admiral said.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they opened
it themselves from inside.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It opened, some
water came out of it,

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
but the two were in
seat-- were in seats

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of escape,
maybe escape vessel.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what they figured.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were not in the
best of shape, so to speak.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they figured that
their environmental systems

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:90%
were failing.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So they had to figure out how
to keep these things alive.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So they tried all sorts
of methods to do it.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to figure
out what kind of air

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
they were breathing, and they
weren't breathing oxygen,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:90%
it was something else.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the admiral couldn't
explain how they did this,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:90%
but they kept them alive.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
They put them in an
infirmary under heavy guard

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and they transported, they
went to Perth, Australia.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
did they look like?

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They were Greys.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
They were typical Greys,
the big eyes, no ears,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:90%
slits for mouth and nose.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
They had just four fingers with
suction devices on each finger.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Their arms were a
little bit longer

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
proportionally
than a human body.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Their skin was changing colors.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:84%
The admiral says the doctors,
the Navy doctors had--

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:84%
knew nothing about these things
so they couldn't obviously

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:90%
treat them.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But they noticed that the skin
was getting darker and darker

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:90%
and darker and darker.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors figured that
meant that they were probably

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
going to die.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:90%
They're losing their life form.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
what to do to help.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, as the ship
was going to Perth,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:10%
a UFO came within distance
of the USS Kitty Hawk.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, no ship can ever
approach an aircraft carrier

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:90%
as an admiral told me.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
They have destroyers and
planes that will take off.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going to let
anything close to that aircraft

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:84%
carrier, but this
thing somehow did.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.197 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up
landing on the deck.

00:23:32.197 --> 00:23:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're in a
dilemma, what are we going

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:90%
to do, now that we got these?

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So the captain says, let's just
turn these things over to them.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't happen.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, a new or some
kind of environmental controls

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
was left on the deck
and this UFO took off.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Navy personnel took this
stuff down to these two ETs

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and put them in the room and
they knew what to do with them.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And they came and their
skin started lighting up.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:90%
So they basically saved them.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Why did they do this?

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.733 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I asked the
admiral over and over again,

00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't make
any sense to me.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they just
take their buddies back?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Why did they give
them the light--

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe they wanted
them to stay with us?

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Was that what happened?

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And admiral says,
that's the consensus,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
is that they didn't
want them maybe.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Here's-- you can keep them alive
but we don't want them anymore.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make any sense.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:90%
But they got back to Perth.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.810 align:middle line:90%
They were all right.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:90%
They seemed to be surviving.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
A C-141 Air Force plane
flew in from a base,

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:90%
probably Hawaii, Hickam, landed.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:84%
They had these containers that
they placed these ETFs into.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Put them on board this
C-141 and flew away.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, that's
a great story, admiral,

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:84%
but there's got
to be more to it.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got
to-- did you ever

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
recover that other
spacecraft that crashed?

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Where did the ETs go?

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They say that
they ever communicated?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Those are all the
questions I asked him.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they
ended up in Area 51.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, so they took
them in 1981 to Area 51?

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:90%
And what did they do with them?

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't know.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I had no connections
with the operation

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:90%
after they got to Area 51.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:90%
The Air Force took over.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We recovered, the United
States Navy we recovered,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
we did our recovery
operations, and the Air Force

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:90%
took over from that point on.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened to them.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if
they're still there

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were
returned to their kind

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and flew back to their
planet or what happened.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what happened to
the recovery of the craft that

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:90%
crashed?

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, three years
later we recovered it.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.672 align:middle line:84%
A foreign salvage
company, I believe

00:26:03.672 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
it was a Japanese because
they're the best in salvage

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:84%
operations back in
those days in the '80s,

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
they came in and
managed to bring it up.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
heavily damaged UFO.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it got
to probably Area 51

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know where
it went from there.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I asked the admiral
many questions as did others

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
in the room that was
talking, Wendelle

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Stevens and some others,
but the only information

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.448 align:middle line:84%
that the admiral had was
what I just told you.

00:26:32.448 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why do
you think it took place

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.040 align:middle line:90%
in such an isolated location?

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Why were they interested
in Kerguelen Island?

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's
something down there.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a base down there.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's close
enough to Antarctica.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it's a
relation with Antarctica

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
because that's where they
all came out of, you said.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, they all
came from Pine Gap on radar

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:90%
from Antarctica.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So the next big
question is, is there

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
an alien base for the Greys
somewhere around Antarctica,

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:90%
under it, deep under it.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Close to it?

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Do we know about it?

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.393 align:middle line:84%
He said, of course, me being
the former intelligence

00:27:18.393 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
officer said, you probably
know more about that than I do.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:90%
And I don't.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know much
about Antarctica.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know about the weapons
that were tested down there,

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Zeus and Spartan, and some
other things about Antarctica

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and the bases that were
established down there.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And a missing submarine
that occurred down there.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
anything other than that.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.977 align:middle line:90%
There's a Navy base down there.

00:27:38.977 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I would think an admiral
in the United States Navy

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.143 align:middle line:90%
would know more than I do.

00:27:42.143 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And we joked back
and forth about that.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't know anything more
or he wouldn't tell anything

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, they took
the specimens to Area 51.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And two years
before that, the sub

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that was missing for 20 years
actually showed up near there.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there some sort of exchange
program going on here, Rick?

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: You know,
that's what I think.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:84%
We lost-- the United
States Navy lost 69 men

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.870 align:middle line:84%
aboard that submarine
that disappeared

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.810 align:middle line:90%
in 1959 around Antarctica.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But the submarine
appeared in 1979

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:84%
near Heard Island which is
some 400 or 500 miles south

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:90%
of Kerguelen Island.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
There's too much
going on here that

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
could connect the two without
actually connecting them.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of
commonality between, maybe

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
between the submarine that
disappeared and the one--

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and then they found it,
and then this crash.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Was there an exchange program?

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.640 align:middle line:84%
They have 69 of our people
maybe someplace on their planet

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:90%
or on their base--

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
under the ocean
or wherever it is.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And now they gave
us two of theirs.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we just couldn't
understand it.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were trying
to communicate with us

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
with that message,
and listen, you

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:84%
can have these two, let them
help you develop technology

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, I mean,
that they could assist us

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
in our society or our
advancement of research

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
into reverse engineering
of their craft.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe these
things are happening

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and we just didn't have
the ability to communicate.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:90%
We're the ants.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:90%
They're the humans, so to speak.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand them
and they don't understand us

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:84%
but they're more
advanced than we are.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, coming from
wherever they're coming from

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and doing what they're
doing on Earth.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
They can defy gravity,
they can defy the ocean.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:90%
They can defy water.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.310 align:middle line:90%
The resistance inside water.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, resistance
is big inside water.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Our submarines can't travel at
lightning speed under the ocean

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.880 align:middle line:90%
but their crafts can.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.990 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they will help us.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these two entities
that came up out

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean that we
have now in our custody,

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and now are going to Area 51 or
are now at Area 51 maybe they

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.080 align:middle line:84%
can answer all these
questions for us.

>>EMERY: Well, Rick, thank
you and thank the admiral

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:90%
for such a fascinating story.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The Intel on this, I
think, a lot of our viewers

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:90%
were really going to absorb.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
being on the show.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:90%
