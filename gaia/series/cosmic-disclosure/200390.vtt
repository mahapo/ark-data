00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are talking with Randy

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Cramer, a veteran of the
secret space program,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
known as the Earth
Defense Forces.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people talk
about time travel,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:84%
what can you elaborate
on that for us?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's one of the
most complicated subjects

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:10%
technically and
scientifically that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:10%
exist within covert military
space program activities.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Agreed.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding is the
personnel which are selected

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:90%
to work with Time Corps--

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:90%
so, I guess, we'll start there.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
there's a Time Corps.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:90%
They regulate all time travel.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Who's in control of
the Time Corps, though.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Time Corps is in
control of Time Corps.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> And who's in control of them?

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> They are associated
with the military,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
but they don't answer
to the military.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Nor do they answer to any
political or ruling bodies.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
They actually are
operating under mandates

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
time-space stream.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And will do whatever they
deem is necessary or required

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:90%
to keep the time stream clear.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they human?

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, all terrestrial humans.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.730 align:middle line:90%
All terrestrial humans.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of the smartest
people on the planet.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
a certain IQ just

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to be able to really
understand temporal mechanics.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So they only take the
smartest of the smartest.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:90%
You don't get to volunteer.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.747 align:middle line:84%
There's no I want to
sign up for Time Corps.

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
You get recruited from another
program because you're capable.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> They find you.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> They find you, bring
you into the program,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and then put you through
their training programs

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and their temporal mechanics
classes and so forth.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So that people can
understand what they're doing

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%
and how they operate.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And how they tinker with time
travel and how they do that.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:90%
And what they do it for.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In the projects,
when I was there,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a lot
of these classified files

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
and reading things that my
clearance was allowed me

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:90%
to read.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And even back then,
in the early '90s,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
it didn't seem they like
perfected it at all.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So where do you
think it's at today?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And still, what determines
why are we traveling?

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that, like
all of the technologies that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about when we
talk about any of these covert

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
military space
program technologies,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
there's definitely a
curve of advancement.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
what is right now,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:84%
it's not the same as what was
10 years ago, 20 years ago.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same as what it's
going to be 10 years from now

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
because we're making
constant advancements.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> When was the first time
this was actually invented

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and discovered that
you're aware of?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding is that
there was tinkering with time

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
travel all the way
back into World War II,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
both by the Nazis
and by Allied forces.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.258 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we perfected--

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't want
to say perfected--

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say, I
don't think we were

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
able to get a functional device
probably until the 1960s.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But even then, my
understanding is

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the first couple of people that
went through, we lost them.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:90%
They went somewhere in time.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:90%
We're not sure where.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So we've lost a few people
doing that in the early days.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, we've definitely
had early programs.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Basiago was part
of Project Pegasus.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:10%
He's extensively discussed that.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:10%
I talked him about that.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:10%
I think he's a completely
legitimate source

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:10%
for that information.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So even he talks about how
they were testing the programs

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and running kids through the
programs to test and so forth.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So where they've
gone from then to now

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
is far more
sophisticated, but yeah,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.632 align:middle line:84%
it's a constantly
changing process.

00:03:48.632 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
where they are now

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.240 align:middle line:84%
is much more sophisticated
than they used to be.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Probably the number
one thing that they do

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
is regulate space travel in
which time travel is a factor.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So we know, for instance,
in the training programs

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
that I was trained under, that
it was fairly common to go

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
for a training period
and then come back

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:90%
"15 minutes" after you left.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
All of those trips have to
be run through Time Corps.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way that if
you want to fly on a plane

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, you can't just get
in a plane and jump in the sky

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and go where you want.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:90%
You have to file a flight plan.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.062 align:middle line:90%
You have to let the FAA know.

00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to let air
traffic controllers--

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're like the
tower of space travel.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> They are space
traffic control.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So anytime anybody
wants to go somewhere

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.173 align:middle line:84%
that involves time travel, you
have to file your flight plan.

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:90%
They have to clear it.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So that they make
sure that people

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
don't run into each
other in places

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
supposed to run into.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.962 align:middle line:84%
So in the briefings that I got--
and I don't know how accurate

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
this is because I think some
of it might have been a little

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:90%
hype--

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but the Time Corps
personnel, always when

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
talking about time
travel, say things like,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
if you ever run into yourself,
don't talk to yourself.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Hide.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Don't make physical
contact with yourself.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if you make
physical contact

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
with another version of
yourself in the past or present

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
or future, quantum explosions
can potentially happen.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
They will say don't
shake your own hand

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
or you could rip a hole
through the time space fabric.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, they told me new
timelines can actually form.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:90%
that does not include you.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you can screw
up time really bad.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a whole
set of protocols on dos

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and don'ts when you're involved
in any amounts of time travel,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you ever involved
with any of those programs?

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I've traveled through time
in the sense that anytime

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been on a training program,
my tour of duty was ended

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
by a trip in time back to
15 minutes after I left.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's about the extent of
my time travel experiences.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know there's different
levels of time travel,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
which we'll probably get
into, because just going space

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
travel, you're
actually losing time.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Then there's actual
portal technology,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:84%
wormhole technology,
black hole technology.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And then actual
devices that we have

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:84%
created that you actually get
into and go on your missions.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Has any of this been
controlled by the SSP?

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all of the
technological development

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
by the research and development
programs through the SSP

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
eventually get filtered
up to Time Corps.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They take anything
and everything

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:84%
that's useful to them
in managing time travel.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What happens when various
people from Earth time travel

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to other planets, and other
destinations, or even,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
within the Earth's time
frame of its existence?

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like I said, there's
a lot of dos and don'ts.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who is involved in
a time travel program would be

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:84%
given the briefs on the dos and
don'ts of what you're supposed

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Not do.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Interactions you're supposed
to have or not have.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But why would the Time Corps
send anyone into the future

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:90%
or past?

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, time wars are a thing.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So there are conflicts
throughout time

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:84%
in which other people or species
attempt to manipulate points

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in the timeline that Time
Corps goes back and corrects.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's other Time Corps
fighting with Time Corps?

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are other species
who have access to time travel

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
technology who are attempting
to manipulate our timeline.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And Time Corps has
to alter any attempt

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:90%
to alter our own timeline.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So they have to deal with the--

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Time Corp protective unit.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's their
jurisdiction-- yes.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And what species
are these that are

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.052 align:middle line:90%
competing with us with this?

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we know that the
Zetas were one of the first

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate a time
window, that they could get

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
into our timeline and then move
up and down in the timeline

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.725 align:middle line:84%
to try and manipulate our
history and our affairs.

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So they were
certainly the first.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The Draconians played with
that for a little while.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So at first, it
was kind of a mess

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't able to go
back and correct these things

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Other advanced species
were doing it for us.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And then after they had
to do it a few times,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.770 align:middle line:84%
they went to some personnel who
were involved with time travel

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
mechanics and time travel
technology and said look,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
we've had to repair your
timeline eight times this year.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
We would like to not have
to do your job for you.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's help you understand
how to do this job yourself

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.005 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't have to
keep fixing your timeline.

00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can fix it when someone
wants to come in and mess

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.288 align:middle line:90%
with your world.

00:08:20.288 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the questions
I get a lot, Randy,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
is if someone were to travel
into time and maybe assassinate

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
someone or even go back in
time and move your coffee cup,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:90%
would we be aware of that?

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It turns out there are a
complex set of algorithms

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that can be done to determine
whether changing something will

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:90%
really matter.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, not
to diss some people,

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
but some people have very little
or no effect on the timeline.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And if they were to disappear
or fall off a cliff,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
it would not be likely that
anything significant would

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:90%
be affected down the timeline.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you take people who
are large impacts on life

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:84%
like political figures,
social figures, people

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
who have a large impact on
society or civilization, well,

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
that's going to potentially,
rapidly change timelines.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
calculations like,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
what if I move my cup
from here to here?

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Or what if I move your
cup from there to there

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and then you have to take a
few extra seconds to move down

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.573 align:middle line:84%
Well, there, again,
there's these algorithms

00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that the Time Corps folks can
crunch numbers on and determine

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:84%
how many variations that might
make and whether they matter.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The variations might
make a difference

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
in whether you use the
restroom at 2:45 or 257.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And that may not
matter to anything.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
If there's a phone call
in there that's critical

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that you have to be on at 2:50
and you don't get on that phone

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:84%
call, well, then maybe that's
going to change something.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So again, there's
these algorithms

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:90%
on how they figured out.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not black and white
where you change something

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
drastically change time.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:90%
The butterfly effect--

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I step on a butterfly
and all of a sudden,

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.695 align:middle line:84%
then we come to a reality
where Nazis won World War

00:10:08.695 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:90%
II, or something like that.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Which is just not
the way it works.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's complicated algorithms.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And certain things can have an
impact and certain things just

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
won't.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Have you experienced this
Mandela effect or something

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that you've seen in the public
eye while you're in a 3D

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:84%
that you've questioned, wait a
second, that wasn't like that?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, yes, I do.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, I actually asked a
friend of mine, I was like,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
so I haven't really gone into
this Mandela effect thing.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And we spent some time,
he was pulling some things

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
off the internet going, how
do you remember this thing?

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.253 align:middle line:90%
How was this spelled?

00:10:44.253 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember it this way?

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.878 align:middle line:84%
And then he would click on it
and go, that's the way it is.

00:10:47.878 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled up like a
dozen different things

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that he and I and another
roommate were discussing.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And there were all
kinds of differences,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.412 align:middle line:84%
where we remembered it one
way and then could look it up

00:10:58.412 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
on the internet and
it's a different way.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.063 align:middle line:90%
So there's a few of those.

00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
My understanding-- I'll
just say super quick--

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
my understanding
is the reason that

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:90%
exists is collapsing timelines.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:84%
That there are timelines
that have collapsed

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and that they have merged
with other timelines.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So the timeline we're on is
not a singular temporal chord.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It is a merging of multiple
temporal chords, in which

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
diverging realities, in which
certain things were completely

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
different on one
timeline to another

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and now, they've come together.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you have people
who just remember things

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
completely differently
because they

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:90%
were on a different timeline.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's overlapping.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're
merging together.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Joining together.

00:11:36.605 --> 00:11:38.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're
merging together.

00:11:38.022 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And people are having similar
experiences from history,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
but not exactly.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's questioning that.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and the divergences
are pretty definable.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of things you can
say, well, look, you either

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:84%
remember it this
way or this way.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.398 align:middle line:84%
And there usually isn't
a third or fourth option.

00:11:58.398 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Says, no, no, I
remember it this way.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It's usually oh, yeah,
it's either this or that.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
look it up to confirm,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
there's only one way that it's
defined in the current way

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:90%
that we exist.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of other people
have a common experience

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:90%
of it being another way.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.565 align:middle line:84%
Which is it's a super
fascinating thing.

00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:17.365 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Super fascinating.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It certainly gives
us an indication

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
of just how literally
liquidity flexible time is.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not a rigid concept.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not a constant
mathematically at all.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a very flexible
and fluid variable

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
in the mechanics of the
physics of the reality we live

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in, it's incredibly complex,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any negative agenda
that you're aware of with time

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
travel that other species might
have besides the Time Corps?

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
There are other
species who use time

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate species
timelines, their past.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.440 align:middle line:90%
To make them more controllable.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
To destabilize them.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Or to make it easier to
divert evolutionary pathways

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.652 align:middle line:90%
It's a very common thing.

00:13:07.652 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
That once a nefarious
actor species

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.620 align:middle line:84%
gets that technology,
that they're

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
going to use it for a
negative purpose, if they can.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Which is one of the
reasons why, at some point,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
we had to develop
our own program so

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that we could have our own
defense network against that.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Because ETs don't
want to babysit us.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
The reason they've
been helping us develop

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:84%
our own military space
program is so that they

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:90%
don't have to babysit us.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
The reason they help us develop
our own Time Corps program

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't
have to babysit us.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they want to
do to help us grow and advance,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:84%
the primary reason
is so they don't

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
have to take the time and
energy and babysit us.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:90%
That's really it.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the
benefit out of this.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there any other benefits for
time travel for us, as humans?

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.720 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
that the one time

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that I had a conversation
with an officer

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
from Time Corps, which
was a few years back,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
he was explaining a little
bit about how they function.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he was explaining to
me that their headquarters

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:90%
is actually in the future.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to go to
Time Corps headquarters

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and you went to the
physical location

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
where they're at today,
there would be nothing there.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not in the
present, they're in the future.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So their headquarters
is in the future.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And as it was
explained to me, it

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.443 align:middle line:90%
exists within a temporal bubble.

00:14:29.443 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sure it's
more complex than this

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.708 align:middle line:84%
because he said to
me, he said look,

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to dumb this down for
you so you can understand it.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So he prefaced that when
I explained this to me.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'll preface that
when I explain it.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.150 align:middle line:84%
This is how it was dumbed down
to me so I could understand it.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
He said think about a
bubble in time and space

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
with a military
headquarter base in it.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So that every day
when you wake up

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and you look out at
the world around you,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
it exists independently
of that bubble.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:84%
He said so some days we
wake up and the planet

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:90%
is burnt to a cinder.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And we know that that's a
day that the day before we

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:90%
didn't do our job very well.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Some days we wake
up in the morning

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:90%
and everything is shiny.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Cities with flying cars
and clean green atmosphere.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we know
we did our job right.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So apparently,
what they're doing

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
is nudging the timeline as
it approaches the point where

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:90%
they are in the future.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So that they can guide
the complete outcome

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
of civilization
to a better place.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So they want to aim for
that shiny, flying car city

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:84%
future, not the burnt
to a cinder future.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, as we get
closer in time to the location

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.763 align:middle line:84%
where they are, and we're
within a few years of that,

00:15:46.763 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
well, they'll just move
another 50 years ahead

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and they'll do the same thing.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.948 align:middle line:84%
And they'll nudge
it down that way.

00:15:50.948 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So probably, the
greatest benefit

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:84%
is people who are actually
tinkering and nudging

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
whether or not extinction
events can occur,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
global thermonuclear
war could occur.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So they're able to
on a daily basis,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
nudge the timelines
to end up in a place

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
where it's preferable, instead
of just, let's roll the dice

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and see where we end
up in 20, 30 years.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So they can't really
have a timeline collapse.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they can move
out of that timeline.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, if a timeline
collapsed onto the timeline

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
that they were on, they
would have to recalculate

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:90%
their algorithms, basically.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.690 align:middle line:84%
To just figure OK, we've
got more variables that

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.090 align:middle line:84%
have entered into the
timeline that we're on,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
so now we have to
recalculate our algorithms

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to
nudge to get to the point

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:90%
that we want to be on.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we always on a timeline
collapse trajectory or?

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Not that I understand.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Timeline collapsing
is a result of some

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
of the other experiments that
are being done in opening up,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:84%
in some cases,
very large portals,

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
portals big enough

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that you could fly
a ship through.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's some of
those have incurred--

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:84%
let's just say--
temporal accidents

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:90%
in which somebody screwed up.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:21.279 align:middle line:84%
And an entire universe
folded in on itself.

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And in order for it
not to cease to exist,

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that timeline then merges
with another timeline.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't cease to exist,
it joins another timeline.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And then that has to
merge and go forward.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it just becomes
part of another timeline,

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
rather than just blinking
out of existence.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I was taught at one time
that when time traveling

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and changing time, if you
were to for whatever agenda,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that if it were to be found
out, that you create another

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
timeline.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there's now
multiverses and multiselves

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
now fix that, too.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Has that ever happened?

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
That if someone makes a
mistake and screws up and makes

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
10 different
alternate timelines,

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
then that may make a lot of
work for the guys at Time Corps

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:90%
to tie those loose ends up.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And either bring the
timeline back together

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
or tie up the loose
ends so that you

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
have timelines that aren't going
to screw with the universe.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible to say
there are infinite timelines

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:90%
and multiverses?

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>> In theory.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
The way that it's been explained
to me that that's in theory.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
That there are an
infinite number

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities that can be
happening at any given time.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But that in actuality, only
some of those realities

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:90%
actually happen.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's a
weird hair to split.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, just by having

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
a thought-- if I think do I want
to go have Chinese food today,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
or do I want to have Mexican
food today, or do I want to go

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:90%
have pizza today?

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Just thinking
about those options

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
creates three possible timelines
that are possible and are not

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:90%
quite real.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But they become part of that
infinite possible probability

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
stream, but the only one
that actually happens

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:90%
is the one I choose.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And there may be another version
of me in another timeline that

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:90%
makes a different choice.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But all of those choices
don't actually exist.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
The possibility
and the probability

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
exist, but they don't actually
exist until they happen--

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%
if that makes any sense.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It totally does.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.467 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of questions,
too, about when is,

00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:84%
let's say, disclosure
going to happen?

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Or when is this ET fake alien
invasion going to happen?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
When is the next big
threat from the asteroid?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
they're always there.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It's always the possibility
of that happening.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to win
the lotto next year?

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a possibility.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one of the timelines.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing this
year and what is the world

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
doing at that time
that guide you

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to these different
realities on the timeline?

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's changing
constantly-- constantly.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So from here, no one
can truly predict

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
six months from now.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're in the future,
if you come back here,

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that future can change based
on choices and decisions that

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:90%
are made here.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%
So there is no fixed future.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And there is no fixed past.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And there is no fixed present.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But somehow-- and this is
the part that blows my mind--

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
it all works itself out
without time and space

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:90%
coming to an end.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
There's governing
laws of physics

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that decide how these
things sort themselves out

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that just go beyond us
understanding, necessarily,

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:90%
why does a rock fall?

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
We understand gravity, but
why does it even exist?

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So we can ask ourselves
these questions about time.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Why does this exist?

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Why does this work this way?

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And some of those questions,
we have no answers to.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We only understand
well, it just is.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding and how
other species understand this,

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
this is just the
way that it works.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's been the
understanding of it.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And we obviously have to be
a lot smarter, a lot more

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
evolved to be able to ask the
more complicated questions

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:84%
or to know the answers to those
more complicated questions.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> With other different factions
that are aware of the time

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
travel technologies, possibly
even using the time travel

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
technologies for good
or bad or to fix it,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:84%
are they changing the timelines
for their own benefit?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it depends on their
ethical and moral center,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:90%
if they have one.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So some species
may be manipulating

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:90%
time for their own benefit.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Some species may be
attempting to manipulate time,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
hoping or believing that
it's benefiting someone else.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe somewhere
in between, where

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:84%
there's some self-interest
and some interest

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to help someone else.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it fair to say that these
time travel wars going on have,

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe, different agendas
specific for that species?

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Like, you kind of were saying
that's possible, but is there

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
anything that you're aware
of, or have heard of,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
or read up on that that's
actually happening?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the basic
answer to that is yes.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
these species, one

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
of their primary
attempts to tinker

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
are to go back to
military conflicts

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.515 align:middle line:84%
where very decisive events
determined whether we're

00:22:44.515 --> 00:22:46.140 align:middle line:84%
going this way in
time or whether we're

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%
going that way in time.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And so by tinkering with
wars and military events,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:84%
you have the greatest
possibility to change, well,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:90%
who's in charge when it's over?

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Because who's in
charge when it's over

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to depend on one
line of history or another.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Now are they're time
travelers from the Time Corps

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that are put in
place to say, well,

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be this person
that's going to be in charge

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:90%
of this to prevent this chaos.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds like it's got
to be a pretty a chaotic event.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
they do is Time Corps

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
representatives, one
of the main things they

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:84%
do when they travel back through
time, is talk to key figures

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and nudge them.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And basically have a
sit down and say so,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I know you're thinking
about this choice.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me recommend that
you do this thing.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Without exposing themselves
or exposing themselves?

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes completely exposing
themselves and just being

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:90%
completely honest.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:84%
That was what happened
when the Time Corps

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:90%
officer came and talked to me.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
He was in an
environment suit that

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
protected him and the
environment that he was in.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So that he couldn't
spread bacteria

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:90%
or get contaminated bacteria.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the thing when
you're traveling through time,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
you can take viruses and
bacterias back with you

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that no one can defend
against during that time.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Or forwards or backwards,
you have to be sterile.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And we had a very
straightforward conversation.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I was in the middle of
this very complex moment of

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
should I do A, or B, or C. And
I was being very indecisive

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And he showed up
to say look, I know

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
you're being really
indecisive about this.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Just make up your mind.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Do the thing that's the
most you and it'll be fine.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But let me encourage you
that for your timeline

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to work out right, according
to the bigger timeline,

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.540 align:middle line:84%
it really would be best
for us if you'd be the best

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:90%
you that you know how to be.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Because that helps the
long-term timeline.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
If you just do you,
then you'll make

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the decisions that will end
up in the correct place.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you're indecisive,
and you're not certain,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know what
you're doing, and you're not--

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.867 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to end up
here destroying the world.

00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You could end up way
over here and not helping.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And we would like it if you
do the thing that you're

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:90%
supposed to do and be helpful.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
straightforward, honest,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:84%
all cards on the
table conversation.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
There didn't seem to
be any hidden agenda.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:84%
His goal seemed to be to just
so that I understood the bigger

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:84%
picture and did the things
that were the most appropriate

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:90%
for that big picture.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they visit
not only people--

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
political figures-- but
do they visit lay people?

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, will they come back
and visit a scientist

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that's 18 years of
age that's going

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to develop an overunity device
that saves the planet from gas,

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:90%
coal, and oil?

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And would they bring back a
little secret circuit board

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:90%
to say utilize this?

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> They would not bring a
piece of technology and hand it

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:90%
to someone.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
That would be a violation
of the temporal laws.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But if that person was having
an indecisive moment at 18,

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
then they might get a
visit by someone saying,

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
hey, I know you're contemplating
architecture or physics.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.773 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to encourage
you to pick physics.

00:26:05.773 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
be the path that's

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:90%
going to work best for you.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, they
just want to appeal

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to your more sincere
sense of yourself.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So they don't tell you you
need to do this thing that

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
is completely out of your nature
or against what you would think

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:90%
you would want to do.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Usually, they're just
encouraging people

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
to be the most of
whatever they are.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Because that will ensure
the more likely outcome

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:90%
that they want to have.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.065 align:middle line:90%
So it depends.

00:26:36.065 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
If someone's having that
waffling on the fence moment

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.837 align:middle line:84%
and it creates this
divergence of two options,

00:26:41.837 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
then yeah, they might
have someone come back

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and give them a little nudge.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And it can be scientists.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It can be political figures.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Might be a cab driver.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you're at
this corner tomorrow

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and you pick up that guy.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Or make sure you're
not at that corner

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and you don't pick up that
guy and you're over here.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Because that's going
to be important.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's whatever
the algorithms tell

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
them are important events that
where this one little key log

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
event needs to go either
this way or that way.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of any
specific time or agenda going

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
on, on this planet
or off planet?

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like I said, I
certainly know that there have

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:84%
been attempts by certain species
to manipulate our own timeline.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And Time Corps to correct
that whenever necessary.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it
happens elsewhere.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure that I'm read
in on something that I could

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:84%
say specifically here, I know
of this program or this agenda

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I guess I, could say
that by answering, I

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:84%
do know of some specific events
that I was briefed on when

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I was read in on
the fact that there

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:90%
are conflicts throughout time.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:84%
That there are a
number of-- well,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
let's say, so
during World War II,

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
there were a number of
attempts to sabotage

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Naval missions on both sides.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So there were
occasionally, someone

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:84%
who would come in
from another time

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
space, extraterrestrial
place and come in

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and plant bombs that would blow
up submarines or ships that

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.480 align:middle line:84%
in a conflict would have tipped
the scale if they had gone off.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And that we had to send
people to those ships

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to diffuse those bombs so
that they wouldn't blow up.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Why don't you think they
stopped Hiroshima and all these

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.208 align:middle line:90%
invasions?

00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Because some of those
things are part of the natural

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:90%
timeline.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
They're not someone coming in
and trying to screw things up.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:84%
They're just our own mess
ups and our own screw ups.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I think sometimes--
what do you think--

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have to go through
these horrible incidents

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
so we can become more conscious,
because if m we won't be there

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.872 align:middle line:84%
And possibly, these
extraterrestrials

00:28:56.872 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:90%
won't be there, either.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there seems
to be some truth.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
That if we were to go through
history and delete our most

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:84%
traumatic civilized events,
we wouldn't be the species

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be
who we are at all.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
things that we just

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
have to go through as
a planet and a species

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to grow up.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So my next question is, is
it possible that another species

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to help us evolve more
consciously could come back now

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and create a war or a
cataclysmic event that would

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:90%
bring us even closer together?

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.203 align:middle line:84%
>> They could
attempt such a thing.

00:29:34.203 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But if they attempted
such a thing

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:84%
without the cooperation
of Time Corps,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Time Corps would interfere and
stop that thing from happening.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how many people are
involved with Time Corps?

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
How many time travelers are
actually traveling right now?

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands, from
what I understand.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of
personnel within Time Corps.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And at any given moment,
on any given day,

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
they could have over
1,000 officers traveling

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:90%
through time.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And what gives them this
power and right to decide

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.940 align:middle line:90%
what's best for us?

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Or are they just doing
damage control all the time?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, what gives them
the right and the authority is

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.510 align:middle line:84%
they understand it
better than anybody else.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And so anyone else who
comes along and says,

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
hey, what gives you the
right, their questions can be,

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:84%
do you understand how
temporal mechanics work?

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand how
collapsing timelines work?

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand how
to work the algorithms?

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And when someone
says no, well then

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:90%
shut up and let us do our job.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So their main
authority is the fact

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.335 align:middle line:84%
that they know how to do
it better than anyone else.

00:30:30.335 --> 00:30:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, no
one else is qualified

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:90%
to manage it other than them.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a lot to say.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
understand the science

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:84%
behind something that
I don't understand,

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I would want that
person in charge of it

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and just give my
faith into that.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But if there was a
way to expose that,

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.970 align:middle line:84%
do you think it will be
ever exposed so people

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.950 align:middle line:90%
can learn more about this?

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
anyone can learn this

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.540 align:middle line:84%
if we have the right
teachers teaching us.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
there's an inevitability

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.010 align:middle line:84%
after a disclosure event
when that could happen.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I would just not know how
to speculate whether you're

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.490 align:middle line:84%
talking five years after
disclosure, 10 years

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:84%
after disclosure, 15, 20
before people start talking

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:90%
about time travel or not.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It's going to depend
on how we absorb

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the other
information, I think.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So do yo u think they're
monitoring us to see how well

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and how conscious we're going
to become to be able to use this

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it seems that right
now that they're in complete

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:39.940 align:middle line:90%
control of it.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:90%
They're tinkering with it.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And there could be catastrophic
events happen because of that.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.628 align:middle line:84%
And we wouldn't even know
that that even happened.

00:31:48.628 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:84%
We're just rolling with the
timeline-- no pun intended.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, pretty much.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much
in the situation

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:90%
where we have a choice.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.910 align:middle line:84%
We can either trust them
because there's no ability

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and no way for us to interfere
with that process that

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
could come in and
say, hey, we don't

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:90%
think you're doing this right.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:84%
We want to do it
this way and have

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.050 align:middle line:84%
the right, or the authority,
or the power to do that.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of have
to trust them.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Or spend a lot of
time mistrusting them.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say
that experience

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:90%
has taught us to trust them.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So, so far everything that they
have done and every interaction

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.300 align:middle line:84%
has been in the
highest integrity.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And appears to be
for our best outcome

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and not for any other reason.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I first had this
conversation with this officer

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.720 align:middle line:84%
from Time Corps,
it was news to me.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was explaining
all sorts of things

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:84%
about how they do
their operations

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.070 align:middle line:90%
and how they tinker with things.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And it actually left me with a
sense of security knowing wow,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.562 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad somebody smart's
in control of that.

00:32:52.562 --> 00:32:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, who
knows what would happen.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So I personally think we've
put the smartest, best

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.822 align:middle line:90%
people in charge of it.

00:33:00.822 --> 00:33:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, they seem
to be able to handle it better

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:90%
than anybody else.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So until that changes
or they give us

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:84%
a reason for that to change, I'm
going to go ahead and give them

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.350 align:middle line:90%
my confidence, as well.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if these time wars
are always changing realities,

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:84%
where do you think we're
heading with humanity

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and as a collective
consciousness?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> To a better future, if
the guys from Time Corps have

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:26.850 align:middle line:90%
anything to say about it.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So their goal is to lead us
toward that future, where

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:84%
you have clean
energy, flying cars,

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and poverty has been eliminated.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And transportation,
both ground, air, space

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:90%
is integrated into civilization.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.100 align:middle line:84%
The most advanced computer
technology is integrated.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And we actually get to
have the civilization

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that the tools we have says we
could if we just applied them.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So the civilization
that we have right now,

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
it's like we have
all these tools

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and we just keep using hammers
and screwdrivers to build

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:90%
brick mortar, steel girders.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:84%
When we have better
technology that

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.870 align:middle line:84%
could build better
infrastructure,

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
better buildings, better sewer
lines, better water lines,

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.594 align:middle line:90%
better power lines.

00:34:15.594 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:84%
And create a better civilized
infrastructure than the one

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that we have, if we just
applied the technology

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.139 align:middle line:90%
that we actually have.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do you see time
travel and consciousness going

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:90%
for a benefit to the world?

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If our most advanced
extraterrestrial friends

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and neighbors suggest to us
through their own actions

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:84%
and their own choices what that
could work out for, it could

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.860 align:middle line:84%
work out to be the best thing
that we could ever hope for.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
That we could end up
not only in a place

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:84%
where we get to choose our true
outcome for the next 1,000,

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years or longer by
understanding how to manipulate

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and nudge timelines.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And as we master
that technology,

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
then we find ourselves being
able to be in the position

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that some of these
other species have

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.720 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help and
tinker with other worlds

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:84%
in our corner of the
galaxy of the universe.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So the better we get at this
technology, the more of our own

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:84%
policing that we take over
from other species who

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.760 align:middle line:90%
are doing it for us right now.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Randy, thank you, again.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful conversation.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for having me.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
