>>SÉBASTIEN MARTIN:
Those technologies

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.520 align:middle line:84%
are so advanced
that sometimes it

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.000 align:middle line:84%
requires more than just
being humans to use them.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They've been able to
go through portals

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and travel onto other
worlds from the US.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Those alien beings working
with the SSP in Australia

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:90%
were in control.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:90%
The SSP was not in control.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
helping the SSP

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
to navigate through the cosmos
using their own technology.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic maps allows you to
navigate through the cosmos,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.772 align:middle line:84%
but also breaking the
barriers of space and time.

>>JOSH GOLEMBESKE: This is
a roadmap to the universe,

but also showing you
where the portals

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:84%
are that you can jump in and
out and go where you want.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

cooperating with them?

Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:10%
joined by Sébastien Martin,
a former multinational CEO

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:10%
in remote viewing
experiencer, to explore

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:10%
what global intelligence
networks and secret alliances

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:10%
with ETs reveal about
who's really in control.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske, MUFON field
investigator and your guest host

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Sébastien, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.012 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, thank you very
much for having me back again.

00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Now, Sébastien, with
your various interactions

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
with different intelligence
operatives around the world,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed any
reoccurring patterns when

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the ET reality?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, of course.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Lately speaking, I
was communicating

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
with agents working
for the CIA and also

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:84%
for the SSP, sometimes
agents from the CIA works

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:90%
for the SSP and vice versa.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was those
guys are literally telling me

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that they are working
with alien technology,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
but in order to work with them
and to be able to use them

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
they have to have enough
knowledge about themselves

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and about the
technology otherwise,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
the machines won't
be functional.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:90%
But they are human beings.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
However, they have
knowledge not just

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
to make them function
because they are either

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.717 align:middle line:84%
engineers or specialty engineers
or agents in the field,

00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:28.800 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter what it is.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
those technologies

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
are so advanced
that sometimes it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:84%
requires more than just
being humans to use them

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
even if they are
accessible to humans.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So for that purpose, the
Pleiadians, for example,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
have unlocked certain
components within those agents

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:84%
so they can actually
use those machines

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and help the governments
they work for.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's just one aspect of it.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, they've
been using Stargates,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
so they own Stargates
within the US.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
They've been able to
go through portals

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and travel around to
other worlds from the US

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and using those technologies
within those agencies.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But those people
are usually hybrids,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.765 align:middle line:84%
so they know they're
hybrids, but they're also

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:90%
working for the government.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
A regular person,
like a regular agent,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
would not be able to go through
those Stargates, for example.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I understand.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's various countries
and intelligence apparatuses

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
around the world all
sharing the same problems,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.925 align:middle line:84%
and working with
the same species.

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They've all come to
the same conclusion

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that they need hybrids to help
access some of these tracks

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:90%
like a portal.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct, yes.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Not just hybrids,
for example, we

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
talked in the past about
the Stargates in Iraq

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and how the SSP
engineers were working

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists were working
with Stargate for those Anunnaki

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:90%
beings to come through.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.748 align:middle line:84%
So the SSP was already
working with those beings

00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
or communicating
with them, at least.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe
that they were

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
going through the portals
of the Stargates themselves.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It was only
basically one access for them

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But in Australia,
for example, when

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I worked with the
intelligence officers there,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
there was one
officer in particular

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
who was picked and chosen
to work for the SSP there.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling
me stories about what

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
he was doing with those ETs
that they were physically

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:90%
interacting with for fun.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: For fun?

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, just to learn.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
there was one race

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:84%
in particular that was a stick,
a stick that looked like a broom

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:90%
stick with arms and legs.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were like
yellowish, pretty much

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
like the same ones that were
held at the Sandia Labs facility

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about in
the previous episode.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I was working with
those people, what came out

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
of that was those alien
beings working with the SSP

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
in Australia were in control,
the SSP was not in control.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: In control of
what, the relationship?

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.922 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They were pretty much
controlling the relationship.

00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So if they decided we don't
want to work for you anymore,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
we go and there's nothing that
those agents could have done.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: And we're still talking
about the stick beings here?

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We're still talking
about the stick beings, yes.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But they had access to
knowledge and information

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
on basically agendas, same
as the Draco Reptilians

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
or the Pleiadians,
but they were sharing

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
other types of
information and knowledge

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:90%
on reverse engineering.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Same idea as the Pleiadians,
but on a different level.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And so Australia has
access to technology

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that is shared within the
Five Eye organization.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So they are sharing information
and intelligence information

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:90%
to do with that as well.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.273 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: The Five Eye's
just for the audience

00:05:45.273 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:90%
is Australia, New Zealand, US?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yep.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: France?

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.923 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: France is not
part of it, UK and Canada.

00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: UK and Canada.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But France does
participate within the Five Eye

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
organizations, but are
not officially registered,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:84%
but they do still
share information.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Great.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have to know more
about these stick beings

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:90%
before we go deeper.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
This is new, I've never
heard of this before.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:90%
It's super fascinating.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.352 align:middle line:84%
So can you just more describe,
I see a stick figure in my head,

00:06:11.352 --> 00:06:12.810 align:middle line:84%
can you give me
any more than that?

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.893 align:middle line:90%
What their face look like?

00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:90%
What are their eyes?

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.305 align:middle line:90%
They're 3D, it's not like 2D,

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: They are 3D, yes.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.638 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: --walking around in--

00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, they're 3D
beings, they are 6 foot tall.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty tall.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they have
just like a slit for their mouth

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and a seat for their eyes,
and so they can open wide.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine a few inches
wide and just gulp things up,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes into whatever
digestive system they have

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and which must be
very intricate,

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:90%
but at the same time limited.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, those
beings are super telepathic.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
They can also use
telekinesis, so they

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
can move objects and stuff like
that as well from a distance.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have had
a lot of knowledge

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and ancient knowledge
about the universe, mostly,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they were
sharing with the SSP.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
They were sharing informations
on cosmic maps, for example.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So not so much about
our world, even

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:84%
if we are part of the cosmos
and we are on the map.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But they were actually
helping the SSP

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to navigate through the cosmos
using their own technology.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.475 align:middle line:90%
So that was their main purpose.

00:07:20.475 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Do you know
where they're from?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I don't know.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Are they benevolent?

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.015 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like they are.

00:07:26.015 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, they
were benevolent.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
they were powerful.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look
like threatening.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem to have
come with an agenda,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
but the SSP knew that they
had an agenda of their own.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't know
quite what it was.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know if they had
an alliance with other races.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.428 align:middle line:84%
They were not part of
the Galactic Alliance.

00:07:46.428 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, that's interesting.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And they had
no connections to Earth,

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and they had no soul
contacts with human beings.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So the question as to
why they were there,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.303 align:middle line:84%
it came out as they were only
there to help us with the maps.

00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Just the maps.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Just the maps.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: How do we make
contact with them originally?

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.568 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I don't know.

00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that part.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I got involved
into a mission that

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
was involving the
SSP in Australia,

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and then those stories came up.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really
know the full details

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
on how those beings were,
where they came from.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I only knew glimpses of stories
like that of these people

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they work with
the Australian government.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So the maps are quite
interesting to me

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:90%
because I heard this as well.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
And I remote viewed
the cosmic maps before.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
So I understand how that works,
especially for the Pleiadians

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
or from the Pleiadians
perspective.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So I know this is accessible
to more than just one race,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: The maps themselves
are accessible by more

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
than one race, is that
what you're saying?

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And the cosmic maps allow you
to navigate through the cosmos,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:84%
but also breaking the
barriers of space and time.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can use it
as a time traveler.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
You can go back in a specific
region or portal in space

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to go back to an actual
time or specific time

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.780 align:middle line:90%
on Earth or elsewhere.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Really?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Well, this
is correlating

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
with other recent whistleblowers
who've come on cosmic.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is a roadmap
to the universe,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
but also showing you
where the portals

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
are that you can jump in and
out and go where you want.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Did they talk about
also traveling in time

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
through these portals or just
moving through present time?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of times.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Each portal has a different
specific location and time.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
complex to the cosmos.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:90%
And it can be accessed through--

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
it's like an elastic
band, you can stretch it.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So a mothership
can go through it

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
or one person can go through it
depending on what is the need.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So each one of
those access points

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
can be stretched
to on demand based

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
on whatever is confronted
through that portal.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So you go in front
of it, and then

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
the portal
automatically knows what

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
is the requirement for space
and size to come through.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
into too many details,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
but this is like paralleling
another conversation I just had.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:84%
This is really,
really fascinating.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if these
portals are engineered

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:84%
or they're just naturally
in the universe?

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Both.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Both?

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So they are both
portals, they are

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
portals that are man-made
using ancient technologies

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that the Pleiadians, even
the Dracos have created.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And then there are also some
natural portals in space

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that were analyzed,
identified pretty much

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
the same way as we would
identify stars in the cosmos

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.330 align:middle line:90%
with our telescopes.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And we can just say, OK,
we can identify this one

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and put a name to it.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
They have the same ability
with portals in space

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and see how they react.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
They can go through it, come
to a certain time and space

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and location, and then go
back using a different portal

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.305 align:middle line:84%
because the same portal
can be used twice.

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Once you go in
once, it shuts down forever?

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.763 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's a one way portal.

00:11:10.763 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you go
through a portal, it

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
brings you back to a specific
time and space into a location.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's say the Pleiadians
come from the future,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
they want to go back to
planet Earth let's say 200 BC

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they want to
go back to that time,

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
they have to use a different
portal to go back to that time.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
They can't use the same
portal they came in through.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:84%
That's really,
really fascinating.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:90%
So the portal is still there.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:84%
When they go through
it, it's still there.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
They just can't exit that same
portal is what you're saying?

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.282 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Thanks for the clarity.

00:11:42.282 --> 00:11:44.433 align:middle line:84%
And what is the closest
portal to Earth?

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There
are some on Earth.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.735 align:middle line:84%
Lots of portals
on Earth directly.

00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: They talk about
Stargates or just something

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%
different?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.115 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No portals.

00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have portals
all over the planet.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:10%
Like, if you go to Peru alone,
you can see those portals.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:10%
They have-- shaped
basically doorways

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:10%
on walls that can be activated.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:10%
So you can go through that.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the technology
to do that, but local shamans,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and I talked to one of them
recently like a week ago,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
that told me that they
go through those portals

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
because they can activate
it through frequencies,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:90%
but it's a one way street.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So they usually don't go all
in, they just put their heads

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
through it, and then they can
see what's on the other side

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and they can feel the energy
from it, whatever it is.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's like a
different way of activating it,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I guess, from what it used
to be used in the past

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
or how it used to
be used in the past.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there are many, many
portals on planet Earth,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:84%
even into the ocean, above
the ocean, in the air,

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
they are so many places.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And these shamans,
I mean, I imagine

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have
advanced technology,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
they must be using consciousness
in some way to activate it.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, that's correct.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: And they just
peer in for a second.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.305 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Pure meditation,
consciousness, and vibrations.

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And then did they
tell you what they

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
saw on the other side
of any of these portals?

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They tried to
connect to the Pleiades mainly.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
They truly believe that
they are connected to that.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
People, especially
first nations,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
have direct connections to other
races, like the Pleiadians,

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, even in
Canada, on Vancouver Island,

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
where I reside, they
have connections directly

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:90%
to the Pleiades.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they don't
look white people.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.342 align:middle line:90%
They're not white people.

00:13:31.342 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But that's basically
my knowledge

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
on portals to know how many
they are around the planet

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and how many are used
by our governments.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that either.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
What I know is that
there are governments

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and for those that
have been working with,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
mainly, they've been
using man-made portals,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
within certain facilities,
and that's what they use.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen them using
natural portals on the planet.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Sébastien, you're
obviously a French national,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:59.620 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.217 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: We don't
hear about France

00:14:01.217 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
too much in the world of UFOs
and secret space programs.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.513 align:middle line:10%
We have the famous
COMETA report back

00:14:05.513 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:10%
in the day, which is
really interesting.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:10%
But what can you share about
France and its cooperation

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.537 align:middle line:10%
or relationship
with different ETs?

00:14:12.537 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, that's
very interesting

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't
aware of that myself,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and I was surprised
when I was told

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
by one of the secret
services in France

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
telling me that the
French government had

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
worked with the Grey aliens
for the last 50 years.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:90%
And that was big news to me.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's not
surprising, but the fact

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that the French had knowledge
and not just knowledge,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
but also bases of
crafts in the Alps,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:84%
for example, close to the German
border and the Swiss border,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:90%
and they had bases over there.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:10%
There's also
Jean-Pierre Petit, who

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:10%
was a French scientist who was
working for main scientific lab

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:10%
in Paris.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And then he got contacted
by some aliens or messages

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:84%
through documents
called the Ummites.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Ummites had information
on reverse engineering

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:90%
or technology.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
He was a scientist so
he looked at the codes,

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and the codes were
very advanced.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And so he believed
that a regular hoaxer

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have done that.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It was too complex
and he wrote about it.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was fired from his
job from making it public.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I've discovered was
the French equivalent of NASA,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:84%
also have developed
technologies to create

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:84%
glass holes portals inside
of a lab on a smaller scale.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to one
of the scientists who

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
told me and explained,
again for fun,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:84%
saying that while they
were doing the experiments,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:84%
they were throwing Coca-Cola
bottles through the glass hole.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:90%
The bottle was disappearing.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And on the screen they
could see its path going

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:90%
to someplace in the cosmos.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they
were able to harness

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
one of those natural
portals that they

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
were able to bring back into
this lab on a smaller scale.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
they were doing it,

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.403 align:middle line:84%
but that's what they were
trying to explain to me.

00:16:15.403 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So that portal was
not fixed in place.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It was movable.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So they didn't create a
portal, they moved into a lab.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They moved it into
a lab on a smaller space.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And throwing that can
was enough to show

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that the portal recognized
that was the only space needed

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:90%
so it stayed small.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
When they threw the
can, it was stay

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
in the same dimension as the
can, it was not going any bigger

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
or trying to be
expanding to the point

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that it could literally
swallow the whole lab.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So it stayed in a
very controlled zone

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:84%
in the lab to use
small objects, only

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:84%
using small objects
to throw through

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and trying to find out
where it was going.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I have 80 questions.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So the portals adapt to the
size of the object trying

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:90%
to walk through it.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you walk through
it, it'd be like,

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'll get a little
bigger for you.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, that's right.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: And then the
Coke bottle does that

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.603 align:middle line:90%
and it just does it intuitively.

00:17:04.603 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
It just knows what's--

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.603 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It knows itself.

00:17:06.603 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It knows how to
adapt to whatever

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:90%
shape and forms come through.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow, that's fascinating.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
Just to clarify, what you mean
by glass portal or glass hole,

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
that's not actually glass.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.968 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No, it's not glass.

00:17:17.968 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But this is, again, I'm
only repeating the names

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that those guys repeated
because I remote

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
viewed the actual portal itself
and the whole experience.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to see it
looking like a drinking glass.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.547 align:middle line:84%
And so it felt
like you could see

00:17:35.547 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
if you look at from the
bottom of the glass,

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:84%
you can see the shapes
distorting and pretty much

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
the same thing as what you
would see through that portal.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
You could see the lab behind
the actual glass hole,

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
so you could see the
lab, it was distorted.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you were
able to see through it

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and see what's in the
cosmos, you are only

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.290 align:middle line:84%
seeing what was in the lab,
but in a distorted manner.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: But this was less
about where they were going,

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
it was more about moving the
portal around and using the--

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's interesting.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
they were doing it.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, I do believe that they
used the help of the Greys

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:90%
to move that portal.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I think the Greys, pretty
much like all races,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:84%
have access to that cosmic
map that we talked about.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys have
access to the same maps,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.210 align:middle line:84%
but they also have
access to other portals

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
on the planet where they
know where they're located.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
They use it to even
send a craft through,

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes to escape
curiosity from most people,

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes even
our own military.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So they basically decide
to be very evasive

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and use portals to go in and
out of places without being

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:90%
detected.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.613 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Do you have any more
information about the Greys

00:18:46.613 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:90%
and their bases in the Alps?

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sort of, yes.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that they have, within
the Alps mountains, basically

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:84%
closer to let's say a
large meadow a field.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And then right above
that, you basically

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
enter the mountain into a base
that's inside the mountain.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's not really high up.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
The access to those bases are
pretty close to the ground.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people would think,
oh, there are so high up

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.380 align:middle line:90%
that it's hard to access.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
that one base

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I've seen remote
viewing it in the Alps,

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I could see the green meadow,
I could see the entryway,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and the entrance actually opens
up the mountain shapeshifts

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and is completely
cloaked and crafts go in

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and then the
mountain forms again.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you don't
see any entryway.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just pure mountain.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen the
inside of the facility,

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I've never remote
viewed what was inside.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I only remote viewed
the exterior of it.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So it's
not really a door,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.490 align:middle line:84%
just like they can
materialize through it.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.907 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's
kind of materialize

00:19:53.907 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:84%
like a rectangular shape opens
up, and then the craft goes in,

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.493 align:middle line:84%
and then it just shape
back into the mountain.

00:20:00.493 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's no
doorway, there's nothing.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.443 align:middle line:90%
It's pure visual.

00:20:03.443 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I heard that before.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:90%
That lines up actually.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I once remember hearing
about a physicist who

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
was the director of the
National Center for Scientific

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.357 align:middle line:84%
Research in France, and
he spoke about ET contact.

00:20:13.357 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell me about that?

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: So this is
the Jean-Pierre Petit,

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:10%
that's the man who basically
received the documents

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:10%
about the Ummites.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:10%
And so he was in
charge of the CNRS

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:10%
in France, which is the main
research for the equivalent

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:10%
of NASA, basically in France.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And when he received
this information,

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:84%
it was definitely a language
or code that was known to man,

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
but it was very advanced
quantum knowledge, basically,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that he was able to use for
his own books and propulsion

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.955 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I think you just said
a new ET species I've never

00:20:49.955 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:90%
heard of before, Ummites?

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.815 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Ummites,
U-M-M-I-T-E-S.

00:20:54.815 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Who are these guys?

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No one really knows.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Those beings were never
in contact physically

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
with Jean-Pierre
Petit or anybody else.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
They first appeared in Spain
and they shared information

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.040 align:middle line:84%
through computers with a
journalist at the time in Spain.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And Jean-Pierre Petit
received the information

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
because I believe he had
one of his friends working

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:90%
for one of those news agencies.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And so he was able
to read the codes

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
or the mathematical
equations that were given,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:90%
pages and pages of it.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't really make
sense for journalists,

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:84%
but as a scientist,
Jean-Pierre Petit,

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
was able to read it
and understand it.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this
is very coherent.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
This is not coming from
a hoaxer because it

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:48.554 align:middle line:84%
shows mathematical equations
that are not known to us yet.

00:21:48.554 --> 00:21:49.354 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yet?

00:21:49.354 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yet, but
it makes sense.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to decipher
the codes because there

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.730 align:middle line:84%
were some elements of
it that he understood

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:90%
because he knew of them.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But there were new
information that he

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:84%
had to wrap his brain
around because he said,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:90%
this is new information.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And so he even did presentations
years later on those equations

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
for saying this is basically
information on how to create

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:90%
a new propulsion system.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:90%
So they were sharing how to?

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly, yes.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:84%
But because of that knowledge
and because of Jean-Pierre

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Petit's involvement with
that and making it public,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:90%
he lost his job because of it.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.323 align:middle line:84%
Well, some reason that
doesn't surprise me,

00:22:35.323 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:90%
but backing up a little bit.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know what
these beings look

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:90%
like, we don't know the basics.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.678 align:middle line:84%
They communicated through,
you said a computer?

00:22:40.678 --> 00:22:41.478 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:22:41.478 --> 00:22:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: And we gave
the code and we

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
knew it was some
advanced species and then

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:90%
that was shared.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't know anything
else about the species?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No, we don't.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Because I
know I personally,

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to be honest with
you, would want

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to know every little detail,
you know what I mean.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But that's OK, that's still
amazingly fascinating.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.442 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I still
find it interesting

00:22:56.442 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that those beings decided to
share mathematical equations

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that made sense to really
advance strong scientists who

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:90%
are able to write about it.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
didn't know much about

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
those beings, where
they came from,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:84%
have they tried to interact
with other human beings?

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew because all
they did was communicating

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:90%
through computers.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
why at the time

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
it was said that this was a
hoax because nobody believed

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:90%
that this could be real.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And Jean-Pierre
Petit kept saying,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
no, this is not a
hoax because I know

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that those equations are very
real and it makes sense to me.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So someone who was not really
strong enough or had at least

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
had a PhD level could not
have done those notes.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: There's no way.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Well, it's interesting.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like they
wanted to help us.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.180 align:middle line:84%
It seems like a benevolent
species that reached out,

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason,
to help push us along

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:90%
from a technology standpoint.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting to me
is while Jean-Pierre Petit did

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.460 align:middle line:84%
some presentations with these,
he even wrote a book about it.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he decided to do
presentations in America

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and other countries about
that new propulsion system.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
exactly where it went.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he took
track or anything else,

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't be surprised
if the US government decided

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to take it on because maybe
they already knew about it,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe they didn't, and maybe
they were trying to compare

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
the notes, I guess between the
Pleiadians and the Ummites,

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.185 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Is there any details of
what this propulsion system was

00:24:32.185 --> 00:24:33.580 align:middle line:90%
or how it differs from anything?

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I don't know.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: You don't
know, just some new--

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.845 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I don't remember.

00:24:35.845 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was written, in
details by Jean-Pierre Petit,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.878 align:middle line:84%
but I don't remember
the facts on that one.

00:24:41.878 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Fair enough, that's OK.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.997 align:middle line:84%
With all these
different ET races

00:24:45.997 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:84%
cooperating with different
governments around the world,

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.607 align:middle line:84%
are all their
agendas matching up?

00:24:50.607 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Are they competing
against each other?

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Are they cooperating?

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:84%
What is the overall
picture here?

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I do believe
that they each are cooperating

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:84%
with the governments
for a specific agenda,

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:84%
like the Pleiadians helping
with reverse engineering,

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
even helping Lockheed
Martin, for example.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:84%
They won't admit to that, but
that's what they're doing.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And the way they describe
that technology and what

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:84%
those technologies
can do today is

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:84%
far beyond what we can
design without their help.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So the advancements
in technology

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
has been very drastic
in the last years.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Basically it's an advancement
of technology for us

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
by 50 to 60 years within just
the last few years that we got.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So the new technologies
that will be coming up

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
that will be used by either the
SSP or even by the US government

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
alone, will be far more advanced
than what they used in the past.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's easily confused
with actual UAPs

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that people see in the
sky because sometimes they

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:90%
even look the same.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's very confusing,
and the governments

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.340 align:middle line:90%
won't say this is ours.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
They won't even
mention it because it's

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.060 align:middle line:84%
too top secret at that
point, maybe down the line.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:90%
But today they won't mention it.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Got it.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
