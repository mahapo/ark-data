00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today,
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:10%
we are with former US
Marine Mike Herrera.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
distinguished service record.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
Today, we discuss
the P3 program.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.463 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.713 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE HERRERA: Hey, thank
you for having me on Emery.

00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is this
P3 program you speak of?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So P3 stands
for Psionic Predisposition

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Potential.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
kind of the door

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to screen these people
in order to partake

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:84%
in the other programs
that they have.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So P3, just think of
it as like the door

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to screen these people
before they can come in.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And the way that they
screen these people

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
is based off of the demographic
of being very enlightened

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, as
well as consciously.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.367 align:middle line:84%
So they essentially have people
from Third World countries

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that participate in
this because they're not

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
sitting behind a television
staring at this all day.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're
not pre-programmed.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.853 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No they're not.

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that they
come from these areas.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
The other demographic too
is people from the Bureau

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:90%
of Indian Affairs.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
They also do this
because the fact

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that they're spiritually
adept in a very advanced level

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness compared
to average people.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there certain
countries that they go after

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:90%
for these P3 people other than--

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
is there someone that's more
conscious than the other

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:90%
around the world?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea
to tell you the truth.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But I just know that it's
Third World countries

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:90%
as we talked about before.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like the United States
trying to find a cheaper labor

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:90%
force outside of this country.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:90%
They're doing the same thing.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, because
of the demographic

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
of people being
spiritually elevated.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how are
they measuring that?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: That I don't know.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I know the demographic of people
is mainly women and children.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And some gay men are the
ones that they also seek to.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Those are usually at
least from the contact

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that has briefed me on
this-- that is usually

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:84%
the people he's ran across that
have these specific traits.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.292 align:middle line:84%
What kind of technology
is involved with this?

00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't
know the extent of how

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:90%
they screen these people.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But they get them into these
facilities or these programs.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So these people essentially can
hook up to advanced technology

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:90%
and ET technology.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So the black team in a sense
has created technologies that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%
can hook up to these P3 assets.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the P3 assets
hook up to the technology.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
it as black team being

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
A, psionic person or P3 being B,
and the ET and AT being C. So,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.985 align:middle line:84%
essentially, A can
control C through B.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why do they
need these P3 beings?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, the black
teams cannot control the craft

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
or the technology
just by themselves.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not at that level.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
have to put this labor

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:84%
force of people
who are consciously

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:90%
adept to actually do it.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're using these
people with this technology

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.868 align:middle line:84%
to connect to this
other technology.

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding--
I mean, because these

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
are militaristic people, being
as a black team operative

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
with these people, being
from Special Operations

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of all walks of life, even
contracting companies,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:84%
if you will, they're not at
a spiritually adept level.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure that some are.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But these people can do
some very amazing things

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:90%
with their consciousness.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned people
from South America and others.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's some sort
of genetic lineage or something

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.037 align:middle line:84%
that's in them that makes this
a little bit more adept to this?

00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, genetically
speaking, I'm sure there is.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And they've kind of explained
it more on a genetic level.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, if coming
from somebody who's

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
learning about this as
much as everybody else is,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
so I'm having to kind of
figure out what they're saying

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and how--

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Piece it together.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So I
mean, somebody who

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
does this for a living
day in and day out,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
they could tell you like
the back of their hand

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:84%
on how they screen it
or what these people's

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
genetic abilities
or at least how

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.452 align:middle line:84%
they screen the genetic
predispositions for that.

00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Mike, what
kind of numbers

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about
with these P3 beings.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
We're talking hundreds a
month, a thousand a year

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
or how many people are
they collecting for this?

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: From
what I understand

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
because these people,
again, are human,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
so they're susceptible
to obviously

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
the adverse effects that come
from operating this machinery,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
if you will, as well as the
drugs that they flood them

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're flooding
with serotonin

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of other
uppers because it also

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.902 align:middle line:84%
keeps in a very high
consciousness level.

00:04:22.902 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like somebody
going through hospice

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.812 align:middle line:90%
who's dying of cancer.

00:04:25.812 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, they flood them
with these similar drugs.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.832 align:middle line:90%
And they're feeling good.

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel
like they're dying.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So they partake
in these programs

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.098 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
good all the time

00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
until the inevitable happens,
which is unfortunate.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And what is that?

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.158 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, obviously,
dying from the drug overdoses

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing
with these uppers.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there's a shelf
life on these human beings.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes, there is.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they have to
continually keep refreshing

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:90%
the stock, if you will.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.617 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And how long is that?

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: It spans from--

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I've heard instances where
as soon as somebody gets

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:84%
hooked up to this machine
that they either die

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
or some best case
goes to a coma.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody has this.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But on their earlier
stages of when

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.222 align:middle line:84%
they were refining this
project of hooking people up

00:05:03.222 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:90%
to this advanced technology--

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it like after
a month, a year or--

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't know
the specifics of that.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it just depends on
what the person's threshold is

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.027 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:05:12.027 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're
a disposable item.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Pretty much.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call
them assets or P3 assets.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, assets

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Pink assets.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And this
equipment, where does it

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
come from originally,
talking about the interface

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
between the P3, the
ET, and the agent?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.593 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I
don't know specifically.

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming that
it's coming from

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial technologies
that actually incorporate

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:90%
into these P3 assets.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's essentially a
device that can control.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to plug
something into you

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
predisposition to hook up

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.663 align:middle line:84%
to this advanced technology
and craft, then I control you,

00:05:40.663 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing,
and then you're

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.622 align:middle line:84%
going to relay the
information on how

00:05:43.622 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
we can utilize that
equipment either they

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:84%
can turn it into
a weapon system,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
into some sort of other
advanced technology,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:90%
or even reverse engineer craft.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now how far advanced
is this technology compared

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.882 align:middle line:90%
to human technology today?

00:05:56.882 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Form what I
understand thousands of years.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.257 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I've
personally witnessed, I mean,

00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:90%
that is way beyond cutting edge.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this a
form of consciousness

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:90%
assisted technology?

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, very
advanced, something

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that-- because when people start
coming out with Consciousness

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Associated Technology or CATs.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was in the '80s.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And present day,
I'm sure they've

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
refined this well
over the years,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
even coming in contact with
probably other methods of how

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:90%
to utilize this.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.382 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why haven't
they figured out

00:06:26.382 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
a way to eliminate the
P3 being and go direct

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.335 align:middle line:84%
with these craft and
their technologies?

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I mean,
the only way I

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
can describe it is like you're
trying to have a plumber

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.413 align:middle line:90%
work on a nuclear reactor.

00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:90%
He's not going to know that.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
He's not a physicist or
know how to do anything

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:90%
like that it's the same.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:90%
You're taking--

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Something can't be
taught is what you're saying.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You have to be born
with this consciousness.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, you either
have it or you don't.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So you said these beings can
go for just a certain amount

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
of time with the psionics and
the energy and technology.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they be
tweaked a little bit

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:90%
not to handle so much volume?

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.938 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I'm
assuming that that's

00:07:05.938 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:84%
what they've been doing
over the years is perfecting

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:90%
this system.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, it does
take a lot of assets

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
to go retrieve people, having
to screen them, and then

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
bring them back
to an installation

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and having to do the
indoctrination into this,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you have
people who are already

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the program
they're already in it.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I would make more sense
to refine the system

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and actually keep
them more stable,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
compared to just
having to rotate people

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
in and out because of
the inevitable death that

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:90%
occurs from dealing with this.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's
what I'm being told.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
actual knowledge,

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
firsthand, I don't
have that, so I

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
have to go off of what
they're telling me

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.915 align:middle line:84%
when they're actually
interacting with these people

00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and seeing this firsthand
on their account.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these P3s located
in one specific facility?

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.042 align:middle line:84%
Do they have living quarters,
or are they just worldwide?

00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: They're worldwide.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:90%
They have living quarters.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:90%
They've got medical.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.635 align:middle line:84%
They've got everything, all the
necessities provided to them.

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
They have things that they
can't get anywhere else.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Not only that, but--

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They are
compartmentalized.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
They can't pick up a
phone and call mom.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.875 align:middle line:84%
Well, realistic, from
what I understand

00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
is they don't have
anybody to call.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
if it depends on--

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a whole family
has this ability, or at least

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
this predisposition, then
I'm assuming the whole family

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:90%
is going to go with.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to keep
everything integrated

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:84%
with that, instead of having
just a segment certain people

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, now
they can't call home

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is, right?

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So is there
agents, Mike, that go out,

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
let's just say in Zimbabwe, and
they start looking for people?

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
How do they find
these specific P3

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.093 align:middle line:84%
individuals that are gifted
with this high consciousness?

00:08:43.093 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I'm going
to assume that it's

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.818 align:middle line:84%
with a certain
demographic of the world,

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
maybe certain areas
of the world that

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
are more of a hotspot
for these type of people.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the
actual screening itself,

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they do that.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could
have s machine that--

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's like a satellite
and it finds them or--

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.378 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: It could be.

00:08:58.378 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --they're
just conscious,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
people out there,
looking, that are

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:90%
hired to look for these beings.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: My
assumption would be

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that maybe because P3s can
probably connect to each other

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
as well, that they may be
used P3s to screen others.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.337 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: That's my assumption.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.045 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do we know about
the extraterrestrials that

00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:90%
are engaging with the P3s?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Are this just one species of
race, or is it multiple races?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Multiple.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one specific.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these P3s have
the conscious ability

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.760 align:middle line:84%
to connect to ETs
consciously, too, and connect

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:90%
to their craft.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
when they do this,

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
at least when they're
retrieving craft

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
because they're
shooting them down,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like these P3s
are hijacking that craft,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.682 align:middle line:84%
meaning that it
stunned, and then

00:09:44.682 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that's when they target it
with these weapon systems.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But the black teams
are working with the ETs.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, the black team's
using the P3s to summon these,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they're using
these people to essentially

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
lure them out, and then they
target them, and shoot them out

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:90%
of the sky.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, they're specific.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:90%
They're for bait.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.628 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:10:01.628 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Because they can connect.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.378 align:middle line:84%
Black team can't
connect to these beings.

00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:05.743 align:middle line:90%
They're not at that level there.

00:10:05.743 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the agenda
of the black team

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
is to use the P3s as bait to
get these higher consciousness

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
beings to planet Earth
or into this dimension,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:90%
so they can take them?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And take
the technology.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they're after?

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Genetics,
what are they after?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.413 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Multitude
of that genetics,

00:10:24.413 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, because there's
other things that they do.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
know all about it,

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
but specific with
the program, then,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
yes, they use these P3 assets
to lure these ETs out and target

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
utilizing their genetics

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:90%
for cloning or hybridization?

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes they are.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.178 align:middle line:84%
They're doing certain
things with cloning

00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
from what my
understanding is, even

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.303 align:middle line:84%
with something that's called the
program Life Forms, which are--

00:10:48.303 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure some people
are familiar with that.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's an ET that
they genetically cloned,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
but they integrate
the neurotechnologies

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
into them to be
controlled by humans.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, these PLFs
are almost like a P3 asset

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
to a degree, being
controlled by a black team's,

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
for using for false alien
abductions or to scare people.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:90%
We've heard all those stories.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course, yeah.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
There's P3, like
you said earlier,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:90%
that the agent controls them.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
remote control thing.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.270 align:middle line:90%
So have they lost all free will?

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, they just know
what they're being a part of.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they
have a resistance

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
really resist when

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
you have an
organization that has

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:90%
weapons and things like that.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But they don't know
they're going to die either.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not briefed on that.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they're not.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
They're humans at the
end of the day, you know?

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.223 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody knew
the inevitable was

00:11:39.223 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:90%
going to happen--

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
unless you're very
heroic on that.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, again, look at the
nature of what they're doing.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They're innocently targeting
innocent ETs, you know?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Federal government
prohibits people

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:90%
murdering each other, right?

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But there's no law that
prohibits humans to murder

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials yet.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Has there
ever been a backlash

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
from the ETs coming back
to the black program?

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I am
not aware of that.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I've never been
told that, but I'm

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
sure if there was a backlash,
it would be probably

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
in the magnitudes that would
affect this whole world.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Because my understanding
is that these ETs know who

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:84%
they're dealing
with to an extent.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:90%
They're not dumb.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.153 align:middle line:90%
I mean, but--

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They must
know that we're

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.855 align:middle line:90%
killing them and cloning them.

00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And that's
why they're not--

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Killing our own
humans to capture them.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, that's why
they're not intervening.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't blame them.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.187 align:middle line:84%
They could intervene
at any point.

00:12:28.187 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:90%
And maybe one day, they may.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But the relationship
with the P3s,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd understand,
for the most time,

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
it's a positive thing
with the connection

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:90%
with the extraterrestrials.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But then, you have
the outside element

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
of these black organizations
that are targeting them.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many ET races do
you think have we captured,

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and how many species
have been involved

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:90%
with this horrible program?

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't know
the specifics of that.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.593 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've heard estimations
throughout the year

00:12:53.593 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's been over like 67
different types of species.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's always the
hypotheticals with that,

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have
firsthand with that,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
so I can't really
exactly answer.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people out
there might think

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials
are superheroes,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and their craft are
just so invincible.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we
have the ability

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.967 align:middle line:84%
to capture these individuals,
shoot down their craft?

00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I mean, let's
look at the technologies.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
You have what's called scalar
longitudinal weapon systems,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
right, which is very
advanced versions of EMPs.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
They move faster than
the speed of light.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So if a craft materializes
into their zone

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
or wherever they're
operating these at,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:90%
it's almost instantaneous.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
they materialize,

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.415 align:middle line:84%
they have these tracking systems
that immediately lock on.

00:13:38.415 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Neutrino
light detectors.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they use
to target these things.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's instantaneous.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.738 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it destroys
it, but the impact

00:13:45.738 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of them hitting the ground
is, obviously, what does it.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Because of gravity,
by the same token.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I understand,
it's no kinetic weapon system,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.377 align:middle line:84%
like bullets or missiles
that they're using.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're using these
very advanced weapon systems

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
that essentially stuns them.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So you have that in
combination of the P3,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
hooking to that craft,
and almost hijacking it.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But then, you have that neutrino
light detectors on these weapon

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
systems that target them
instantaneously with the scalar

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.558 align:middle line:84%
technology that instantly
shoots them down

00:14:13.558 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:90%
faster than the speed of light.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.683 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:14:15.683 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I always say, once the ET
craft gets here from wherever,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
once they get into
this third dimension,

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
they fall under
the laws and rules

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:90%
of this scientific dimension.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes, they do.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're
not bulletproof.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yep, and that's how
they've been doing this ever

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:90%
since 1947.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people
think that you have

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
a race that's so advanced
that they can bend space time,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
go from one point here,
and, all of a sudden,

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
just apply to Earth.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, all of
a sudden, crashed

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
in a flat high desert
of New Mexico, that

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make any sense to me.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.905 align:middle line:84%
But then, coming back
and understanding

00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:48.452 align:middle line:84%
how the history
of this happened,

00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:90%
it makes perfect sense.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been aware
of P3, through telepathy,

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
connecting to an ET, to
ask for them to be saved?

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.867 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Not to my knowledge.

00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I
understand, these people

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.132 align:middle line:90%
are treated very well.

00:15:03.132 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:90%
So if they're taken care of--

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they think
they're doing something good.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes,
well, exactly it.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:90%
They're being misled.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how many
times these P3s go out

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:90%
and participate in this.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
think it's a fluke.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.793 align:middle line:84%
If they see something
and shot down.

00:15:16.793 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
keep rotating in and out.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
the specifics of that,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:90%
but they're being misused.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they also just mind
controlling them to an extent,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:90%
in addition to the drugs?

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.615 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: My understanding
is that they're all chipped.

00:15:30.615 --> 00:15:31.415 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: and because
they're chipped, I mean,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.237 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
theories to that,

00:15:34.237 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to where they can
probably be controlled.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of the
black team operatives

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.672 align:middle line:84%
are chipped as well and
more of a tracking system.

00:15:41.672 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can obviously
listen in with other advanced

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
technologies, compared to using
a tracking device that they've

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:90%
been implanted.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.438 align:middle line:90%
So that's the other instance.

00:15:50.438 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:84%
At least, my understanding is
if they're going to be chipped,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.318 align:middle line:90%
it's for a reason.

00:15:54.318 --> 00:15:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You think
this is a specific

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to an American program, or
do you think maybe there's

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.517 align:middle line:90%
other maybe countries involved?

00:16:01.517 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: 100%, there's
other countries involved.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.278 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, these
guys move in and out

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:90%
of boundaries they don't exist.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But above the
presidential level.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Very well hidden.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.263 align:middle line:84%
It's a big secret they're
keeping for obvious reasons.

00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
These guys are making a lot
of money off of it, too,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:84%
but they're also have this
technology that essentially

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
puts every single human being
in the same level as what

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:90%
these P3s are even doing.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
access to that technology,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:84%
then we're all going to be
essentially free energy.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.633 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have to worry
about a combustible engine.

00:16:33.633 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Roadways will probably
be a thing of the past.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is their agenda?

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.605 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're going
to collect these craft.

00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
They're going to collect
this genetic material

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.460 align:middle line:84%
from these fallen ETs
that have been murdered,

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're just going
to keep doing this?

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:90%
And what do they plan to do?

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying
to go into space?

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
What is this black team
trying to accomplish?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.760 align:middle line:90%
What is the end game for them?

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: From
my understanding--

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:90%
I've heard this before--

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is that they've already
been out in space.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if they
want to capitalize on that

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and attack other civilizations
on their home planets,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.823 align:middle line:90%
if they're able to do that.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they working
with any extraterrestrials

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:90%
that you're aware of?

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: In a
negative sense, they

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.045 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be because
I don't think

00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:19.119 align:middle line:84%
any ET in their
right mind would want

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
other civilizations to come in
contact with a murderous human.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.177 align:middle line:90%
I know I wouldn't.

00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It'll be like having a
stranger come in the street

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.827 align:middle line:84%
into your house and
murder everybody.

00:17:26.827 --> 00:17:28.160 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't allow that to happen.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:90%
I know nobody would.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.705 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you
believe that we have--

00:17:30.705 --> 00:17:33.137 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the black team
has been in space?

00:17:33.137 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Oh, yeah.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Have you actually
met P3s before?

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I do have a chance,
though, coming up.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah?

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So I get
to see this firsthand.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
those things I hope

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't see someone getting
shot down because that's not

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:90%
going to put me in a good mood.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of
other programs out there

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.188 align:middle line:84%
where ETs are
working side by side?

00:17:52.188 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Not to my knowledge.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I've heard some
interesting theories

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:84%
about that, which somebody
on the outside that may not

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
be read into that deep
level could assume

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that maybe a PLF is
a real ET, that they

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:84%
could see in a lab
working with scientists.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I could see how
that could play out.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But if we're thinking,
realistically speaking,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
you have a program that screens
these people, which is the P3s.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And these P3 assets are
used to connect to ETs,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.480 align:middle line:84%
more for the specifics of
taking their equipment.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really
sound like it's

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%
working together with anybody.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just more of
somebody forcefully taking

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
something against their will and
murdering them in the process.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So could there be
a possibility where

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
those ETs on this planet
working with people?

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The thing I've
learned about this,

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.157 align:middle line:84%
going through this journey
since April of this year,

00:18:40.157 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
is that anything
can be possible.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
about the P3s being

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:84%
utilized to do stuff
other than acquire craft?

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Are they being utilized,
maybe, to figure out

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
how to use a weapon or a
different type of technology

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
that was acquired?

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, my understanding
is that they're manufacturers.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
can hook to this

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and actually know how to
utilize it to either create

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
a weapon system based off that
technology, maybe a transport

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
device, maybe something
medically engineered

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:90%
to help with them.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
interesting thing,

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
too, is if they can actually
think of something medically,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that's more of an astral level
or something, what an ET would

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
be able to utilize,
then maybe, in a sense,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that they actually may not
have to rotate through these P3

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
assets so quickly
because maybe they're

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:90%
refining with that technology.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that the P3s
are being used by this group

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
in order to help them achieve
what they're trying to do,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
whether it's something
that's illegal,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:84%
unconstitutional, something
that's against human morals.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:84%
They're being utilized
in a negative context,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's not always
something where they're

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
being misled saying, hey,
you guys are doing something

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
good because of the evil
ETs, as well as I do,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:84%
if they were evil, we wouldn't
be sitting here right now.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're
saying that they

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
could be connected to
maybe an extraterrestrial,

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
learn how to build something,
and then come back,

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:84%
have the schematics
and everything

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and give it to the agent
so they can reproduce this.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So I think,
realistically, yes, but I

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
think the agents are more of
like the force that's holding

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:90%
them to do these things.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding is these
P3 assets are also the engineers

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.590 align:middle line:84%
to make this stuff, too, because
they're very smart people.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It's their agents--
because I know that they

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:90%
have their own scientists.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
They have their own admin
personnel, if you will.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Because per scientists,
you're going

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:84%
to have a logistics
that are having

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to do all the other
stuff outside of that.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, so there's
handlers per P3?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes, there is.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
They have their own scientists
in this organization.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not coming from
Harvard or Stanford or anything

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:84%
They're plucked at
different organizations

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even out of high
school that have higher IQs.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they
go into these programs.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And what they think--

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
again, with anything else,
they're being misled.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So if they're being misled
and think what they're doing

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:84%
is completely consciously sound,
they're going to keep doing it

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:84%
until they actually find out
the truth of what they're

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.642 align:middle line:84%
being utilized to
do, which is only

00:21:04.642 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:90%
benefiting this organization.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not benefiting Earth
as a whole, and it could.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:90%
How could it?

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Well, think about it.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're using P3 assets in
a sense for peaceful purposes,

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
let's say if the
government had--

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
maybe in a near future,

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
where they have P3 assets on
the government side of things.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're making contact with
these organizations or even

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrials,
but in a peaceful context.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
That could even
speed up disclosure

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
because then, all
of a sudden, people

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:84%
start seeing these ETs
come out of nowhere.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You know so they could use
it in a positive sense.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:90%
But you have greed.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:90%
You have corruption.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
You have all these other things
that plague these individuals,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and that's all they care about.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.437 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to try to
sequester this technology

00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
from getting out to anybody that
they want the benefits of that.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Mike, working with
all this negative aspect

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:84%
of this whole business, how does
it make you feel personally?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: At first, it
was very disheartening

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:10%
because it's not something
I enjoy talking about.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it is negative, and
it's something that is dark.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Do I see a potential
upside for that?

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and that's why I'm
doing what I'm doing today.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if I get more knowledge
into the public's eyes

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
with this, as well as
everybody else has an open mind

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's
really going on,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.650 align:middle line:84%
then, all of a sudden, let's
say, disclosure does happen

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
or some intervention does happen
to where, all of a sudden,

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:84%
this gets put into
a positive sense,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
then it could benefit
us as a whole.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's got to be a
starting ground at some point.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you
aware of P3s being

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
used to actually pilot
these craft off planet?

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.525 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well I think if
they're reverse engineered--

00:22:35.525 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of
people would be able to.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think, let's
say, hypothetically,

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
if they do shoot one of these
down and they can't operate it

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.180 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they can get
the P3 to connect to it,

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:84%
to get it to move,
or to do something.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So, I think, yes, in a sense,
they may have done that.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be
against my surprise

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:84%
if they do because they're
the ones that connect to it.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:90%
They can connect to ETs.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:84%
If they can connect to an
ET, and the ET connects

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
to this craft the same way,
then, obviously, these P3

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
can also do the same
concept that these ETs do.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not in a
degree that they can,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:84%
but maybe to a little
bit of a degree.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, you mentioned these P3s
and their higher consciousness.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're chosen
for this, and they volunteer.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
What about the general
population of the planet,

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that there are conscious
people out there,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect with
extraterrestrials on their own?

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.288 align:middle line:84%
How do they fall into
category with all this?

00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I mean,
it's certainly possible.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know of people
that can do that.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It's very mind blowing
to how they describe it.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted they have
to go into a cognitive state

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
or a state of
consciousness or awareness

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
through meditation,
which is what I know

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:90%
a lot of that to happen.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But then, you have the P3s
that don't necessarily have

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:90%
to go through those measures.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They can just
instantaneously do it.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
be at that level.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
You know what I
understand, though, too,

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.633 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to keep them
very happy and satisfied.

00:23:56.633 --> 00:23:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
have somebody who's

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to meditate
on angry thoughts,

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to
be able to do this.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not to be able to
do anything because you're

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:90%
so clouded with emotion.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:90%
It's keeping you down here now.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.712 align:middle line:84%
If you're elevated,
obviously, you're not

00:24:06.712 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:90%
going to have those emotions.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be more high
spirited and very happy,

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
which translates to
feelings that are

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:90%
very encouraging and loving.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think people understand
that if you're happy and not

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
in a negative state, maybe
you do get into meditation

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you're
able to connect,

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:84%
then I believe that people can
have experiences of their own.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.812 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Mike, for all
the people out there

00:24:26.812 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that are getting
their small groups

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and trying to contact
ET craft, would you

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:90%
encourage them to do that?

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I would, as long as
it's their peaceful measures.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's nobody
sitting in their house

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:84%
with these advanced
weapon systems.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
They want to bring
something down.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.092 align:middle line:84%
I know people want to see
these things firsthand,

00:24:42.092 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
as well as myself, to see what
really is behind the veil.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think if it's for
peaceful initiative.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And I always support that,
100%, because, one, you're

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
going to learn something
more than what yourself.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we only learn what
we're exposed to daily.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
We learn exactly, from
me, coming on to the show

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and providing your
viewers and everybody

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
on this show the understanding
of what's really going on.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting this
more new knowledge.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:84%
My goal with this is at least
to take this new knowledge,

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:84%
eventually transfer it to a
peaceful means of operations

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:84%
to actually get
more of a disclosure

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and more of an involvement
from both aspects here

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of ETs and human integration.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And maybe humanity
takes off from there.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
That's at least my
wishful thinking.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people out there

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that are going and trying
to contact extraterrestrials

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:84%
have a really good positive
energy about doing it.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that would fall

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.200 align:middle line:84%
into a category of a
being P3 volunteer.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.368 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if a P3 is
being misled to do this,

00:25:42.368 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're being told
every single day that what

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
you're doing is great.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Keep it up.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You're getting attaboys or
however they create incentives

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:84%
for these guys, as
opposed to somebody

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
who is not in that
program that's maybe

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:84%
an elevated level of
consciousness that

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.183 align:middle line:90%
are having contact experiences.

00:25:57.183 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
a lot of people

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.058 align:middle line:84%
are seeing things that they
can't explain in the skies that

00:26:01.058 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
are not made, that they
can definitely tell

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:90%
are organic to a degree.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of it may come up

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:84%
from these people that
are not in those programs,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.945 align:middle line:84%
but they're aware
of what they can do.

a protection for you

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:90%

I want to thank you

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.457 align:middle line:90%
for being on the show.

00:26:20.457 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
It's been very informative, and
thanks for being so honorable.

>>HERRERA: Well, thank
you for having me on

disclosure to happen.
