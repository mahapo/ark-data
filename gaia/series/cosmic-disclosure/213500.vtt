00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:10%
EMERY SMITH: Today on
"Cosmic Disclosure"

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.545 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:10%
who served in the Air
Force Office of Special

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:10%
Investigations.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Today, we discuss
the Working Group.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:90%
RICHARD C. DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Are you still involved
with any active intelligence

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:90%
groups?

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Yes, the
Advanced Working Group.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:84%
This group containing
retired intelligence officers

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:90%
and retired military officers.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.075 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved with the
group for about 20 years now.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: How many people are
in that group, Richard?

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: It varies.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Of course, we've had--

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.695 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: People come and go?

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Unfortunately,
they pass away

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:90%
because they're up there in age.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think at the very
peak, we had 88 members.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're down to
about 64 members today.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.023 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: What is it made up of?

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:17.065 align:middle line:90%
What type of individuals?

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: We have actually
a former director

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of the Central Intelligence
Agency in our group.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We have some top
scientists in our group.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
We have military
intelligence officers

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that were involved with
the program of recovering

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial crafts.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We have two pilots in our
group that actually flew

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:90%
a reverse-engineering aircraft.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Not an alien craft--

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Impressive.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: --a
reverse-engineered craft.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
We have two-- up there in age,
but two former executive branch

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:90%
officers.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
lot of experience

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
with the subject of UFOs,
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:90%
and biologics in our group.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Are any of them active?

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: No, they're all retired.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
One of the requirements
is you have to be retired.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And although-- we don't have
security clearances, none of us

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:84%
do, we have experience and we
have knowledge of what we did

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and the projects that we
dealt with while we were in.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And we have contacts.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Of course.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Especially the ones
who recently retired or were

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
involved with the
CIA, let's say,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
back in the 2000s
or before that.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And so they have contacts.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And they keep abreast
of information.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But we're not out there to give
out intelligence information.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
We're out there to facilitate
whistleblowers and try

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.615 align:middle line:90%
to move along disclosure.

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Well, what is your
group doing to help contribute

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.596 align:middle line:90%
to the UAP disclosure?

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, we are
connected to the Senate

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:90%
side of the legislative branch.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
We have contacts with
legislative personnel, Senate

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:90%
aides, Senate advisors.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't have direct
contact daily with senators,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
we have with their
advisors, although we

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
have had a number of
conversations with Senate

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and senators regarding
the subject of UFOs,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
especially since the
disclosure process started.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:90%
And now we're more involved.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying to
do is get them to open up,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe create a standalone bill
that will require the government

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.903 align:middle line:84%
to release some of the
information they have regarding

00:03:42.903 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:90%
nonhuman intelligence.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Are you giving
them and educating them

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.895 align:middle line:90%
with classified intelligence?

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Well, we would like to.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
careful of what we say

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.375 align:middle line:90%
and who we say it to.

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:57.175 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Of course.

00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: We don't know whether
everyone that we're talking to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
is cleared for the
special access programs

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:90%
that we were dealing with.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We're not giving away classified
information or anything

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:90%
We talk privately.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Myself and a number
of others have already

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
been briefed in
2002 by the DoD IG.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
They talked to us and we told
them what our knowledge was.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
We were cleared to talk about
special access programs.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I tell you the story
about the report

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
that they showed me
that was redacted.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get it under
redacted one from OSI.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's the type of
thing that we've done.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we facilitate
whistleblowers.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We find the ones
that have done things

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:90%
and have hands-on experience.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Those are the very,
very best, not the ones

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that read a report that was
given to them by somebody else.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with pilots
that chase these things

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and shot them down, recovery
crews, DART team personnel that

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
handled nonhuman intelligence or
nonhuman technology or nonhuman

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:90%
biologics.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones that we
facilitate as whistleblowers.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:90%
We get them--

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't
have a big budget,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
but we have somebody
that does have

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:90%
some money that provides to us.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And we get these
people up to Washington

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to testify in
front of the Senate

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:90%
or the DoD IG or the ICIG.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Well, since
it's not classified,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.115 align:middle line:84%
you can probably tell
me what is your role.

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: My role is more
or less a field guy.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I like to go out in the
field and collect data.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a security
clearance or anything like that,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
but I have the experience of
going in and talking to people

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.025 align:middle line:90%
that have seen things.

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:43.825 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Absolutely.

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: A lot of times I
do this on my own dime.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't pay me anything.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I travel with my own money.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I get the information
and turn it back in.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some
occasions where somebody

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
is financing something
and wanting us to do it,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and now then we're
reimbursed for expenses.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm more or
less a field guy.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I go out in the field
and collect stuff.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Well, if you're the field
guy, what are some of the roles

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.765 align:middle line:90%
that other people do?

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, first
of all, you got

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
to understand a lot of our
members are up there in age.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I think the oldest is right
now is at 90 years old.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And they more or less
do the thinking process.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:90%
They know what the program is.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:90%
They know how it operated.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
They know the functions within
each division and bureaus

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that they served in
within DIA or CIA

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
or the Air Force or Army or the
Office of Naval Intelligence.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they can
direct things around.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:90%
They see things written.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They can determine
whether what was just

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
put out on Twitter or Instagram
is real or total hoax.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Most of it's a total hoax.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Usually.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: And we can detect things.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:90%
They do that.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.542 align:middle line:90%
They're sitting at their desk.

00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
out in the field.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any clearances.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't work
for the government,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
but they're there working to
facilitate something entirely

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
different and that's
the disclosure

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of the information the
United States government has

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:90%
on extraterrestrial contact.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want out there.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, we understand that not
everything the government

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
has in their filing
cabinets or safes or storage

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
bunkers out at Area 51 or
Papoose Lake can be released.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
technology has

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
to be protected for
national security reasons,

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot
of information, just

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:90%
a general knowledge.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we
recovered a craft in '47

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even before
that, as I understand.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we have done that.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.975 align:middle line:84%
And I was never briefed
in that part of it.

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we've done as
far as investigating

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.860 align:middle line:84%
this subject of
extraterrestrial contact

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
from '47 on to the present
day and what we've developed

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and what we found, that
shouldn't be classified.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.465 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: That's
profound in itself.

00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: And that's already
out there in the public.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It just hasn't been
acknowledged by the government.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.373 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: What is the
push now for this

00:08:14.373 --> 00:08:15.665 align:middle line:90%
that your group is so involved?

00:08:15.665 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Because the
government's lied to us.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The government has
disinformed us.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:84%
The government has had
deception operations

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
against American people for
so many years, from 1947 on.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, they started to
release the information.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:84%
They actually had
a press release

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
that was written by somebody
that gave the real facts

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and then they drew it back.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Somebody, whether it was Twining
or who it was, brought that back

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and said, we can't release
this to the American people

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
or the world.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
They think that something
like that would occur.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So they kept it from
the American people.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:90%
There were programs--

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Blue Book and before Blue
Book Book, Sign and Grudge.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
There were programs built
into that, those programs,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to release the information
through the media

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:90%
or through motion pictures.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
"The Day the Earth Stood Still"
filmed in 1951 and aired shortly

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
after that, that was a
movie that the United States

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
government cooperated in to try
to get the story out there--

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.042 align:middle line:84%
conditioning, they
call it, the public.

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And that would have been great
if they made these or cooperated

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:84%
with movie industry
to make these movies

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and then come out and
tell us the truth.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't do that.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:90%
They kept hiding it.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
They kept digging
holes for themselves.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:90%
The Condon Report in 1969.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:90%
There were two reports.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.260 align:middle line:10%
Very few people know that.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:10%
Richard Dolan figured that out.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:90%
But there's two reports.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a public
report that came out

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and there's a classified report.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Why hasn't the government
released a classified report?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:84%
They won't even
acknowledge it until just

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:90%
recently that there was one.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
That's just some things
that we can't talk about.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: But no one still
talks about it, though.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: No.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Nobody talks about it
because the government's not

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:90%
releasing much about it.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.705 align:middle line:84%
So now the Condon Report,
we're going to end it.

00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force is
going to end it.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, in actuality,
they didn't end it.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm proof of it and the
other 122 special agents

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
who worked for the Special
Projects Branch did

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:90%
the same thing I did.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
They're proof that, yeah,
the Air Force is still

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:90%
investigating it.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:90%
DIA took over it.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And now DIA, the only thing that
happened after the Condon Report

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is a mission change from
the Air Force to DIA.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
DIA raised their hands
and said, we'll take it.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%
We'll take all this stuff.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.020 align:middle line:90%
They're a relatively new agency.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
They were created in 1961.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Now they needed a mission.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:90%
We'll take it.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So our reporting
system continued

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
after that, the Air
Force reporting system

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.732 align:middle line:84%
through the Special Projects
Branch of the Air Force Office

00:10:51.732 --> 00:10:52.815 align:middle line:90%
of Special Investigations.

00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: So that's when it
ended, the Air Force--?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Ended, but the
process continued.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the late '70s,
I'm investigating UFOs.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
In the early '80s, I'm
investigating-- myself,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.568 align:middle line:84%
and the other 122 that were
briefed into the program.

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
We're all investigating
these things.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:90%
And we're doing reports.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But the reports aren't
going to OSI or Air Force,

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:90%
they're going to DIA.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.972 align:middle line:84%
They're the clearing
house now for it.

00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:90%
So we're sending everything--

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.305 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: So you did all the
work, do all the reports,

00:11:23.305 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and then it gets sent to DIA.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And where does it go from there?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.540 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: A good question.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Who makes those
decisions after that?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Somebody makes
those decisions.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The director of
DIA or the director

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of Central Intelligence
or whoever.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
We're the--

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.012 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Compartmentalized.

00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: --the bottom of
the barrel, so to speak.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:84%
We're the field investigators
and we sent all this stuff up

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I always wonder where it went.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I gathered so much information
like in the incident

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
out at Dugway Proving
Ground, that guy that

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
had all that information of that
contact he's had for 10 years,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I sent all that to
headquarters, DIA.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Where's that today?

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean that in
itself could prove--

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Disappeared.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.580 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: --the existence
of extraterrestrials.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But ours is reporting it, the
government's not releasing it.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And our job is disclosure
because the government

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to do it.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The government is
scared to do it

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
embarrass the government.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have all sorts of ideas
about the public being upset

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and the religious beliefs of
certain segment of society

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.305 align:middle line:90%
is going to be affected by it.

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all
sorts of questions.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
If they do it in a structured
manner, if they've done it,

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:84%
they should have done
it a long time ago,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.975 align:middle line:84%
that could have been
rectified today.

00:12:43.975 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
We would already know about
it, but they're not doing it.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: You have 88
of you guys that

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
have all the secrets that
know that your reports have

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
been disappeared who
knows where they're at.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.642 align:middle line:84%
You guys must be
really frustrated.

00:12:59.642 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: We are.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.685 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: And you cannot even get
those reports you're telling me.

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: No.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.665 align:middle line:84%
We could never because we
don't have any clearance.

00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But when you're sitting
in a DoD IG's office

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and they give you a report
and it's redacted, and I said,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.918 align:middle line:90%
well, this is 40 years ago.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
everything I said in this.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.745 align:middle line:90%
Give me a cleared copy.

00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And they said we
can't get it from OSI.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
What? you can't
get a cleared copy?

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.232 align:middle line:90%
You're the DoD IG.

00:13:21.232 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make any sense.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.482 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: That doesn't make sense.

00:13:23.482 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: So that's just an example
of one agency not knowing

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
what the other agency's
doing or not cooperating.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:84%
US Space Force, a new
branch of the military,

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:90%
they shut down their FOIA.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
They shut down everything
pertaining to disclosure.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The general up there said,
"We're not cooperating.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
give away secrets."

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Eight months prior to
that, he says, yeah,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.865 align:middle line:84%
we have strange things
we see on our satellites.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
they're coming from

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.823 align:middle line:90%
and we don't know what they are.

00:13:55.823 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And then nine months
later, well, we're

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:90%
not going to talk about it.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
release any information.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:90%
You already said it once.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:90%
And then it comes down to this.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
From the very early
days of humans

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:84%
seeing these things in
the air and on the ground

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and the legitimate abductees,
experiencers, and contactees

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
having contact with
these extraterrestrials,

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
all that information has been
written in thousands of books.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Most of it, I would say, is
somewhat accurate, not all of it

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
There's very, very few books
about the Roswell incident

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that's factual, but at least
the story is out there.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And the public should have
then said, OK, yeah, you're

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But they covered it up, or they
disinformed the American people.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:10%
And I was responsible because
in the '70s and '80s I did that.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I was responsible for
deception operations.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was my job.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I was given a plan and I
had to implement the plan.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I see how
that works and I

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.470 align:middle line:84%
see that the government
is still doing that today.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
They're misinforming
the American people.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
They put reports out that are
absolutely lies, 100% lies.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.460 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing factual
in some of these reports

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:90%
that they put out.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
That's just disgusting.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're saying
we want full disclosure

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
in one way or the other.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to damage
national security,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
but we want
disclosure out there.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.055 align:middle line:84%
And that's our momentum
and that's our goal.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Well, thanks for being
truthful and being honorable

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and coming on the show because
not everyone understands

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:90%
what you went through.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And we really appreciate
you being here.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Richard, is there a
hierarchy in there?

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
What's the levels or who's--
do you have a president or a--

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: We have a
leader we call him.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's informal.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not anything structured.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:59.225 align:middle line:84%
We don't go by any
particular rules of order.

00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to sit here and
name everybody in our group

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:90%
because they're private.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But the government knows
who we are and knows

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:90%
that we interface with them.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's always one way.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
We give them, we don't
get anything back.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:90%
And that is upsetting to us.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
We drafted a standalone
bill in the Senate

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that could answer and direct
the disclosure process

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and that bill was shot down.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't get any support.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:84%
We got some support within the
Senate, but we didn't get any.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And we were told the House
would not support it,

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't even look at it
because it came from the Senate.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember, now, one
branch is one party,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
the other branch
is another party.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that's just
very, very frustrating.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that bill
would have addressed

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it issues
regarding disclosure

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:90%
and how disclosure would work.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
You could do this
disclosure process

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.327 align:middle line:84%
without jeopardizing
national security.

00:16:56.327 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Is there a reason
why you stay clandestine?

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: You can work
better behind the scenes

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:90%
than you can in front.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we were
public, we would then

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
be inundated with the
outside interference

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than just being
quiet within a group.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, you understand there's
many other groups that

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:84%
are doing exactly the
same thing we're doing.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
A group in California made up
of ex-scientists from Livermore

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:90%
and Lawrence--

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Lawrence Livermore,
Los Alamos Sandia,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Silicon Valley companies.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a group of
former contractors

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that are stationed
out in Nevada that

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:90%
are working on a disclosure.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.900 align:middle line:84%
There's other scientists
at MIT doing this.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a press group made
of press personnel that

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:90%
are moving towards disclosure.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.362 align:middle line:90%
So we're not the only one.

00:17:48.362 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
There's many other groups
doing the same thing.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.695 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Well, that's
good to hear.

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Are you guys working
together or in a competition?

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: We want to work together.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:90%
There's a group out there that--

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
his name is out there,
Lue Elizondo, his group.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
We want to work
with other groups.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:84%
There's some problems in
ideology between groups.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
They have a particular
way of doing things

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and we have a particular
way of doing things.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have one belief and
they have another belief.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So the ingredients aren't there
to put our groups together yet.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:90%
But we're working.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We always have an
open-door policy.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
If somebody wants to come and
talk to us about something,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:90%
we're open.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
We're open.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
We have a particular person
that acts like a PIO,

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
but he's kind of
behind the scenes.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But he will open up channels for
communications with our people

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
in the higher
echelon of our group.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And we have done this
a number of times.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:84%
A year and a half
ago, we had a meeting

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:90%
with four different groups--

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
personnel from four
different groups.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a great, great meeting.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But after the meeting,
none of the ideas

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that we presented that we
wanted to work together on ever

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:90%
materialized.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: It's
understandable, though.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned these groups
have different ideologies.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Could you go over the ideology?

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.495 align:middle line:84%
What's different
between each group?

00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:21.980 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, the
press people, they

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.455 align:middle line:84%
want a full disclosure,
everything--

00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Of course.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: --including
technologies that

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
could advance health or medical
devices or medical treatment,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
technologies that could
better your home energy,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
do away with carbon-based
fuel, and things

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:90%
like that that is not feasible.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just not feasible.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Some groups have ideology that
they want to restrict disclosure

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:84%
to a very, very slim, slender
piece of the real story.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And then some want
certain information

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:84%
released about technology,
but not others.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of aligned
with that in a way.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And we want the general
knowledge of the United States

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
government's involvement with
the extraterrestrial program

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
from 1947 or whenever
the government wants

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it to
now, to present time,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.552 align:middle line:84%
and leaving out the technologies
and all the other things

00:20:23.552 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that we can't talk about or
the high technology stuff that

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:90%
could fall into enemy hands.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a group--

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
this is pretty much a religious
group that I hadn't mentioned,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:84%
but they're mostly clergy
or religious personnel--

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't say
clergy, all of them,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:52.915 align:middle line:84%
but they want to know exactly
what we know about the--

00:20:52.915 --> 00:20:53.715 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: History?

00:20:53.715 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: --when we
first experienced

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
in our history extraterrestrials
that nobody's telling us about.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
When did they first get here?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Did they create us?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And all these
different questions.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we know or I
don't know that we would ever

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:90%
report even if we knew.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.265 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
We're hesitant about
something to do with that.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Then you got to look at
it this way-- realism.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
If the government, let's say
the government was to say,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to
talk about disclosure

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to give
you the history, can

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.038 align:middle line:84%
you just imagine
how many questions--

00:21:33.038 --> 00:21:33.955 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:21:33.955 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: We're throwing thousands
and thousands of questions

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
about religion and about
all these other things.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have to do it
in a structured way.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And we think we have an idea to
do it and we want to present it,

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:90%
but nobody wants to hear it.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.395 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Does MJ-12
still exist and how

00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:53.395 align:middle line:84%
they fit into this program
you're talking about?

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:57.925 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, I think MJ-12 still
exists but not by that name.

00:21:57.925 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They've been through a
lot of different names.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I think somebody says they're
called Zodiac Pack now.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I've known them by
a few other names.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I think there is still
an entity out there

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
within a quasi-government that
controls all the knowledge.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're the ones that
won't release everything.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in a position
to know that.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But I believe there is an
entity out there like MJ-12.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Absolutely.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Nonhuman biologics are being
referred to under oath in DC

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.835 align:middle line:84%
How does that affect your
group and Washington itself?

00:22:36.835 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, that was
a startling revelation

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:84%
that some of the
whistleblowers spoke about.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.725 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: They can't
erase that now.

00:22:44.725 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: No, they can't.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think everything
that's been said is factual.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
There's volumes and
volumes and volumes

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:84%
of information written about the
subject of nonhuman biologics.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
The last I heard, we
still have 33 bodies,

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial biological
entities at some location.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a couple still
in detention or captivity

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:84%
We recovered not just those
33, but we covered literally

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of other
bodies, some going back

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe hundreds of years that
they'd been at a crash site,

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:84%
but we hadn't
found a crash site.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
things playing into this.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And now the public is
demanding to know now.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Number one, where
are there live ones?

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Number two, how many
bodies have we recovered?

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And what information
have we gotten

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:90%
from these extraterrestrials?

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We understand that they're
not all the same species.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:90%
They're all different species.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But what information
have we got?

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:84%
The brain capacity, the DNA
structure, that's important.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, is the DNA structure
of some of these

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:90%
species similar to our DNA?

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
That would be a question
that I would want answered,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:90%
that would connect us to them.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:90%
And are they from the future?

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Are these extraterrestrials
actually coming from the future

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:90%
back here?

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't believe
that necessarily.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I've never read anything
in any documents

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
or classified documents
to verify that,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
but that's always an idea
that people bring up.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
At one point back when we
started finding these crash

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
sites and these extraterrestrial
biological entities,

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
everything went to the Armed
Forces Institute of Pathology,

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't exist
anymore, but it did back

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:90%
in those days in Washington, DC.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:84%
All the autopsies
were performed there.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fallacy out there is
they were at Wright-Patterson

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:90%
or they were at Los Alamos.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.240 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely wrong.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Every pathological examination
of these extraterrestrials

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:84%
were done at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:84%
We have the former chief
of the Armed Forces

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Pathology in
our group and he tells us

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:90%
we got them all.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.657 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: That's correct.

00:25:15.657 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Because they wanted to
have a central place for all

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:10%
We have special
facilities there,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.050 align:middle line:10%
control rooms, positive pressure
environments, and things

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:10%
like that because they
are different species

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:10%
and they require different-- to
analyze these things and bodies.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have the top
pathologists there

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:84%
because if you farmed them
out to different locations,

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.657 align:middle line:90%
they would lose information.

00:25:40.657 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: All of our samples that
came into Los Alamos and Sandia

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Labs came from there.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
What is the latest information
about alien craft recovery

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.815 align:middle line:84%
that you could share
with us right now?

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: The latest is just
what others have said.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.255 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
clearance anymore.

00:25:56.255 --> 00:25:57.755 align:middle line:84%
I can't read
classified information.

00:25:57.755 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Just a regular
ex-DART right now.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Yeah.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
latest is what we

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.050 align:middle line:84%
were told during some of the
hearings that we do have it.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:08.970 align:middle line:90%
We do have the crafts.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: Of course.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: They're stored at
certain locations in Nevada.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know that
it's either Tonopah or Area 51

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:84%
or Papoose and that we are
doing experiments on them.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
That's really the
only information

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:84%
that's been leaked out that's
been verified by whistleblowers.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: What is
Project Steam Boiler?

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Project Steam Boiler was
started by the United States

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Navy in dealing with
underwater submersibles,

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial crafts that
could go from the atmosphere

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:90%
into the water.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
done is tracked them.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:90%
They have a tracking system now.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We have advanced submarines
that can go a little bit deeper

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
than the conventional
submarines in the past.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:90%
So we can follow these things.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And they have determined
where some of these things

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
are possibly hidden
under the ocean.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking at depths
of 15,000 to 16,000 to 18,000

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:90%
to 20,000 feet.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't have a submarine
that can go that deep,

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:84%
but we have other submersibles
that can go that deep.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But we have sent one down and
that operation was steam boiler.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
is classified.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:90%
But steam boiler is a program.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it's still an active
program in the United States

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Navy.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.530 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Is it possible
this craft aren't actually

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
hiding there but maybe originate
from there or live there?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: That's an excellent
question, Emery,

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
because I think my personal
belief is they probably

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:90%
live there.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: I know they do.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: They probably
created a place.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they came from
another planet someplace

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.343 align:middle line:84%
and they come here and
now they built a home.

00:27:48.343 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
There's some way that
they can live down there

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.857 align:middle line:90%
under that depth.

00:27:51.857 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we couldn't.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Humans couldn't
live there unless we

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
were in some kind of
a special environment.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
there are homes or--

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: I have spoken--

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: --cities.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: I've spoken to many
admirals-- they are classified,

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that said they do have their
own facilities down there,

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.220 align:middle line:84%
little bases, and
craft that are coming

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:84%
in and out through
inner Earth and portals.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.850 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: There's this
admiral out there

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.833 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about
in this program.

00:28:19.833 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We talked about an
incident that happened down

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:84%
at Kerguelen Island where
the missing submarine,

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and he tells the story,
an advanced submarine

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.993 align:middle line:90%
that we had back in the--

00:28:29.993 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's still active,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
but it could go to deeper
depths than most submarines.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And one night they
were patrolling

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and they were hearing this
noise and the sonar operators

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:84%
were trying to-- and they
got to a certain place

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.965 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian Ocean and they
could see the lights deep.

00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:49.865 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: That's cool.

00:28:49.865 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: He said they couldn't
go down there, obviously,

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
but they pinpointed
that location.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And when they went back to their
fleet headquarters in Hawaii,

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:84%
they did a report,
a classified report,

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and they got back that you
don't go back there anymore.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.275 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying now, we
know about that place.

00:29:12.275 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't just find that.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
We'd probably known about
that place a long time.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.412 align:middle line:84%
And that's their
home down there.

00:29:19.412 --> 00:29:20.495 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: That's fascinating.

00:29:20.495 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: That is fascinating.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: Now many people are
talking about this upcoming

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:90%
event with ETs.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.665 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about this?

00:29:29.665 --> 00:29:32.330 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: Well, as I
understand it, the event

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to occur between
now and 2027, not in 2027

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I think the information
that was leaked out

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:46.190 align:middle line:84%
by a number of different
people, a former CIA officer,

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.697 align:middle line:84%
John Ramirez, talked on
his program about that.

00:29:49.697 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's other people
that have opened up

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and talking about something
is going to happen.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
people who are now

00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:00.483 align:middle line:84%
talking about an event is going
to happen between now and 2027.

00:30:00.483 --> 00:30:01.775 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: What do you think it is?

00:30:01.775 --> 00:30:03.608 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: I think it's going
to be a revelation.

00:30:03.608 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's just Rick
Doty talking here.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
background information

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:08.880 align:middle line:90%
on what's going to happen.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I think the government knows.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a meeting
three years ago

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.445 align:middle line:84%
that involved all the
intelligence agencies.

00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It was highly classified.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
It happened in a very
secure facility in Virginia.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people that
came out of there were stunned.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's going to
be an Earth-shattering event

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or if it's going to be a
revelation that they're

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:84%
going to show themselves
to us in some manner

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.895 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they're going to
give us their agenda for us.

00:30:40.895 --> 00:30:43.380 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: So you think
they're getting

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:84%
this disclosure right now
ready for anticipation

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.765 align:middle line:90%
of a major event?

00:30:47.765 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:84%
DOTY: I think this
is the warm-up phase.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
They're generating public
opinion in an unwitting manner

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate some
future disclosure.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The government can
do these things

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:90%
with a number of different ways.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if they have a deception
operation to deceive the public,

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:84%
they can come back
and say, you know

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.860 align:middle line:84%
what, we didn't know
about this, now we do.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.610 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: That's what they do.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Yeah.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And now here's what's
going to happen.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.367 align:middle line:84%
And they're conditioning
the public for something

00:31:15.367 --> 00:31:16.325 align:middle line:90%
that's going to happen.

00:31:16.325 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: What have you
learned that inspires you

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:84%
personally with
all your experience

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.986 align:middle line:84%
with the Advanced Working Group,
with all your years of service?

00:31:24.986 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Wow.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the things
that motivates me the most

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that I know about is that we,
the United States government,

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
has had contact with
extraterrestrials.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.420 align:middle line:84%
We had them in our
custody, reverse-engineered

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:90%
their technology.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I've seen the technology.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.385 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the
communications device.

00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And looking at this thing,
although I didn't touch it,

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
but looking at this
thing and realizing

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.188 align:middle line:84%
that came from a foreign
technology out of this world,

00:31:54.188 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one
of the things that

00:31:55.730 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:84%
inspires me to motivate that
we have to have disclosure.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And we really, really, really
have to have disclosure

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate not
only the people that

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.760 align:middle line:84%
have had been doing this for
70 years that are still alive

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
but the people who have
died and some of them

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:24.380 align:middle line:84%
died doing this, and the bodies
of the people that we lost in

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the
disclosure realm.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And the public has to know
that we have been visited

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and we have connections
with extraterrestrials.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.175 align:middle line:90%
And that's my motivating factor.

00:32:38.175 --> 00:32:39.670 align:middle line:90%
EMERY: That's very beautiful.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And we salute you and your
Advanced Working Group.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And good luck.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Richard, thank you so
much for being here.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.225 align:middle line:84%
It's been a
fascinating interview.

00:32:47.225 --> 00:32:49.555 align:middle line:90%
DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:32:49.555 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
