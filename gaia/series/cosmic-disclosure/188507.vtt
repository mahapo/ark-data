00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:03.944 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:19.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:90%
My name is Emery Smith.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And today we have a
very special guest.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:90%
His name is David Adair.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
David, welcome to the show.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.902 align:middle line:10%
>> Glad to be here.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to be talking
about the infrastructure

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary electrical
grids that we have in place.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they need some
serious upgrading.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But before we talk
about that, why is that?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, we never
think ahead as a race.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And America was
particularly bad about it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:84%
in an area called
infrastructure.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
We wait until something's
crumbling down

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:90%
and can't use it.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Then we jump on it with the fury
of the way we can do things.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%
And we repair it.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But we have constantly upgraded
our bridges, our roads,

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and they've went down again.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in the process of
trying to bring them back up.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing we've
never really worked on

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to bring it back up
is the electric grid.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Since it works and the lights
are on, you know, don't fix--

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Why bother?

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't fix it.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not broke.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's always there.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's fine and dandy
until something like a CME

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:10%
comes along from the Sun, which
it did in September, 1869,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:10%
called the Carrington Event,
named after the astronomer

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:10%
Carrington that
told us what it was.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a thing called a
Coronal Mass Ejection.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And we are so vulnerable to
that, which is nature-made.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> What did they experience
back then at that ejection?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what happened
was, first of all,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:90%
what's a Coronal Mass Ejection?

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:90%
The Sun is rotating.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And it throws off beads
of sweat, like you do that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:90%
and you give it a sling.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
You see all them
beads go out there.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Sun's
doing the same thing.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But that bead of sweat is a
little bit bigger than the one

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:90%
you just shook off.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
When the bead of sweat comes
off the Sun, it is plasma.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It's hot.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is the size and
mass of Mount Everest.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So it comes hauling
across space.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>> How fast?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost up to light speed.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
It can cross 93 million
miles in about 14 hours.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:90%
It can get here--

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and when it does, it's
extremely charged particles,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
with the protons in the plasma.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, we have a
Van Allen Radiation Belt.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
always protect us.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.420 align:middle line:84%
In September of 1869,
which is only four years

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
after the end of the
Civil War, the only thing

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
electronic on Earth at
that time was telegraphs.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So this big ball
of plasma comes in,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
hits the Van Allen
Radiation Belt,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
breaks apart, two
halves roll around,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:90%
smack again on the other side.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Then it comes into the
Earth's atmosphere,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
through the upper
layers, and cascades over

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
the entire surface
of the planet.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would think something
like that would kill us.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:84%
A CME would never harm
plants or animals.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.658 align:middle line:84%
But buddy, it is the
devil on electronics.

00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything electronic goes--

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything electronic,
this thing is going to eat.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And why is that?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It's because of the charge
of the particles will come in.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
it likes to do

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
is find some way to--
like electricity does,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
it's looking for the
least paths of resistance.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
In this case, you've
done a good job.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You put your entire power
grid 40 feet in the air

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:90%
up on top of telephone poles.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Just going, here I am.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Down through the atmosphere
comes the charged plasma

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:90%
particles.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:90%
They'll hit the lines--

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and power lines, first
of all, not insulated.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So all them lines
you see out there--

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy wasted.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one thing.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you touch
one, oh, man, you

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
will light up like a Christmas
tree, right before you explode.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So the other reason
they're not insulated--

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:90%
too much weight.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
It'd pull them down
onto the ground.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So you got all these
naked wires up there.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Here comes the plasma.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It settles down like
rain onto the lines.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And those power
lines are designed

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:90%
to carry about 5,500 volts.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, a CME will drop
about three million volts

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:90%
onto these lines.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
They'll go cascading
down the lines.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Those lines will, in just
seconds, will turn from a line

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to, it's red-hot,
it's white-hot,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:90%
and it's poof-- it's gone.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Right before it
poofs, it's going

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
to give a spike like you're
not going to believe.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:10%
If we were in this room and a
CME hit, all the lights in here

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:10%
would flash like flash bulbs.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
All the-- in your lamps in your
house, your office, lights,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
They all get really, really
bright, -psst- and that's it.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And they're out.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And buddy, they
are out for good.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.542 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to come back on.

00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have
a line crew, oh, we'll

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
go out and string up more
wires, we'll be done.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at at
least two to five years

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
before you can get
your power back on.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the worst part.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:90%
That's just--

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> The beginning.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the hors d'oeuvre.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Wait until you see the
rest of the course.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:10%
Right before those lines go
poof, all the big gray cans

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:10%
that you see hanging
on telephone poles--

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:10%
they're called transformers.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And inside those transformers,
they're filled with oil.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the electricity
goes into the transformer,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
goes through the oil, helps
cool it down, comes back up

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and helps keep
things maintained.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't do that,
you'll melt the lines down.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But that big surge, that spike
that's going through there--

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
it will detonate every
one of those transformers.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.003 align:middle line:10%
Now every transformer
you see is a napalm bomb.

00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been through a few
hurricanes in southern Florida,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and in my backyard, of
course, in the two corners

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
of my backyard, there are two
transformers on each pole.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And every time we
have this hurricane,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:90%
these things explode.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so impressed, because
the only thing it reminds me of

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.473 align:middle line:90%
is a combustible bomb.

00:06:58.473 --> 00:07:00.265 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the field,
of that shock wave.

00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And don't you love that
sound, and the purple light?

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And the light.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And-- ugh.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> That purple light is the
atmosphere being ionized by all

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the charged particles
going on is just bad news.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But so imagine you're
walking down the street,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
the lights flash, then all
the transformers explode.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:10%
Oil comes flying
out that's on fire.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
You got napalm all
over the streets.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that you're
looking at is on fire.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well,
it can't get no worse.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:90%
That's just the first minute.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get
a whole lot worse.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
About 20 seconds after
all that, here they come.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Aircraft.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:90%
All the aircraft that's over--

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
a half a million people in
the sky at any one moment.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:90%
So down they come.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Engines shut off.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Can't restart.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> These are missiles,
full of fuel.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Right into the
ground, full of fuel.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.533 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is more than--

00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of them
could be full of fuel.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And they'll crash into the
streets, hospitals, libraries,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.862 align:middle line:90%
schools, homes.

00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
just coming down.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:90%
They've got no control.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And that, you think, God, help.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, what-- everything is
burning from coast to coast.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Not just a fire--

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.138 align:middle line:84%
you know, when we
have a forest fire,

00:08:24.138 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:84%
like, California, it's isolated
to a part of the state.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Isolated areas.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And the other
48 states can help.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
But in this situation,
all 48 states are on fire.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:90%
From coast to coast.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Everything is on fire.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.007 align:middle line:90%
Well, call for help.

00:08:40.007 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:90%
Call the fire department.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.572 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean can't?

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Cell phones are out.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:10%
Relay towers, transmission
towers, all dead.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Even your satellite
phones won't work.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.918 align:middle line:84%
Because you had to transmit
to a dish that ups the signal.

00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:90%
That thing ain't there no more.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:90%
It's dead.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Ham radios.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It's dead.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Call the police.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't call the police.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're not making
this up, y'all.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not just me sitting
here telling you this.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:90%
There were 26 agencies--

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and I mean, it was everybody.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the CIA, the FBI, the NOAA.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:84%
All these national
organizations were

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:90%
asked to do a study on this.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of these agencies
don't even like each other.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But all agencies came
back with the same numbers.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you better stop what
you're doing and pay attention.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Because that means, whatever
these numbers are, are real.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.530 align:middle line:10%
And they were
horrifying numbers.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
You can count on probably
at least 75% to 85%

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of the population would
die in the first week.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.018 align:middle line:90%
First week.

00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Because they go, well, why is--

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Catastrophic event.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they said, well,
everything is on fire.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:90%
You're going to die in fires.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.088 align:middle line:90%
Smoke inhalation.

00:10:02.088 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>> All the smoke in the
atmosphere too, probably,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Crashing aircraft.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Explosions.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's not bad
enough for you?

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.778 align:middle line:90%
Cars don't run.

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:90%
They've been knocked out.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Their computers have
been knocked out.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:90%
No transportation.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:90%
You're on foot with everything.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Bicycles or horses.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And then here comes the
second wave of horror.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
You go, well, what
would that be?

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:90%
There's no food.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no water.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And something that will really
grab the millennials-- no cell

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:90%
phones.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:90%
No pagers.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:90%
No notebooks.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:90%
No laptops.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:90%
All that is just doorstops.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Useless.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's worse than "Mad Max."

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it'll turn into that.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It will.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It will quickly--
second wave of horror.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Man on man violence.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it really
cranks up the numbers.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.335 align:middle line:84%
People have no food, no
water, no medications.

00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
What about all the
people in hospitals?

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:90%
They're dead.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, they got
backup generators.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.215 align:middle line:90%
About 90% of them don't work.

00:11:08.215 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they never turn
them on to test them.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> What about medication
that people need to survive,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that they get at the
local pharmacies?

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Those are all cut off.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You're dead.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Diabetic?

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a lot
of numbers alone.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It don't take long
to get up to 85%, 90%.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And now you got 60 nuclear
reactors that's on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're losing their
water, because they can't pump.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:90%
There's no power to pump them.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:90%
They've got back generators.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
They only last for three days.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> They're going to overheat.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> They're going to
overheat in three days.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Meltdown.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So now you've got nuclear
reactors that meltdown,

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
could blow out.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And you've got 60 Chernobyls
within continental United

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So that would
end civilization.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You're smoke.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I can't paint a
bad enough picture.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:84%
No matter how bad I paint it,
in reality, when it happens,

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be far worse.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And people are saying,
oh, you're an alarmist.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, Chicken Little,
the sky is falling.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Dude, wake up.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
blackout of New York?

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
That was caused by one fuse
the size of my forearm.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And when that thing
went out, it shut down--

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
you know, the entire
Northeast of America.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And part of Canada.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And the only good thing that
came out of that was the air

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
quality improved over 24 hours,
because there was no use.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> There was nobody
moving around.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And an awful lot of babies
were born nine months later.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But other than that, there
wasn't too much good out of it.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how vulnerable it was.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
One part the size of my
forearm took all that out.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.245 align:middle line:84%
>> We can't prevent
this from happening.

00:12:44.245 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just a matter of time.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.555 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a matter of a time.

00:12:47.555 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we do, though,
to protect ourselves,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.337 align:middle line:84%
or what's the
preventive measures?

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of
things you can do.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That we can do.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Especially starting
with the grid.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you don't have
to go through this.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
pay a trillion dollars.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:10%
For $10 billion, we can
fix the grid, where you

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:10%
won't have to go through this.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
What you do, you
use '50s technology.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Old, tried and true.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:90%
We know they work.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the military's been
using them since the 1950s.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Surge protectors-- diverters,
switches, Faraday cages,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:84%
which is like a net you
throw over a device,

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:90%
keep the C&P off of it.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And just--

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Capacitors?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Capacitors.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Put all this stuff in the grid.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when the charge
comes in, it handles it.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Or saves it.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:90%
It actually saves it.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> You can save it.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, because if you
do it right and get some really

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:84%
big capacitors, man, them things
are going to light up like

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Christmas trees.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And you could pull off for
months of power off that thing.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to die
this horrible death.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Just do a little prevention.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But they thought, well, how
hard is that to get done?

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Man, I can go to
the Moon far easier

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
than I can trying to
get the grid hardened.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just said,
using '50s technology.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Politics.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You've brought this up and
have written many briefings

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.605 align:middle line:84%
And, sad to say, you did not
get really good responses

00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:84%
from the United
States with this.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.188 align:middle line:84%
>> For God's sake, we were
betrayed by our own people

00:14:30.188 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:90%
within our own rank and file.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Senator Lisa Murkowski,
the chairwoman

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Senate subcommittee
on hardening the grid--

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
well, you think
she'd be all for it.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:90%
She killed a bill three times.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:84%
These people are
playing politics

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:84%
with your lives, your kids'
lives, and your grandkids'

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Do your damn job and protect the
citizens of the United States,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.398 align:middle line:90%
who have paid you to do this.

00:15:01.398 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But y'all are sitting there,
and you think you're safe.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And you are not.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So Dave, we talked about
how this is so political.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And you've been having a
big wall put in front of you

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But where else could you
maybe demonstrate this?

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You did tell me you had
another couple space

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
agencies, new space
agencies that came out,

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.263 align:middle line:84%
that wanted you to come over
and maybe demonstrate this.

00:15:24.263 --> 00:15:25.063 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:25.063 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:10%
Because, obviously, America
is not going to do it.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:10%
And it's not the American
people, God bless them.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the idiots in
Washington that won't do it.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I've tried, and
tried, and tried for years

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.400 align:middle line:84%
to get things to change here,
to get your grid hardened.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Middle East
approached me to talk to them

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.952 align:middle line:90%
about running a space program.

00:15:48.952 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So we -- you know -- we're
going to go sit down in a couple

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:90%
of weeks here.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
we're going to talk about.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's just not
all that's on the list.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They've got a laundry
list, you know, this long,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:90%
of things they want me to do.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And if they throw out the
bucks, I can do them all.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But why that affects you is
that one of the items is they

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:90%
want me to harden their grid.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:90%
They want me to do it.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.812 align:middle line:90%
They're asking me.

00:16:17.812 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Here in America, I'm
trying to pound down

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:90%
the door to get people moving.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.790 align:middle line:90%
They won't do anything.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:90%
So I'll go over to the Mid-East.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to harden not
just Egypt or Syria,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:90%
the entire Middle East.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and that includes Iran.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:10%
Oh, he's a traitor.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to save your butt.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:10%
Because I can't have any
continent on fire from a CME,

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:10%
or an EMP attack.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:10%
Because the smoke
will go up in the air.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
It'll be so sick of
an entire continent,

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
it'll blot out the
Sun for two years.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Every expert on
the planet agrees.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And first thing,
all plant life dies.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:90%
No Sun.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Second thing, all animal life.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:90%
That's all you guys--

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:90%
will die.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to-- if
I can prevent that, yeah.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.660 align:middle line:84%
If that means that I have
to harden the grid over

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:90%
in Iran, fine.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't like us.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they will when I get done.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:90%
But it's defensive.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:84%
They can't attack you
with a hardened grid.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, they'll say, well, you
could fire an EMP weapon.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't bother them.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter at this point.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not about different
countries, even politics.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Man, this problem is species.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Survival of the species.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Humankind, worldwide.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
If you don't approach this
thing and tackle it head

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:84%
on, it's going to
come and get y'all.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
See, there's two
types of threats.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:84%
There are other many threats,
but these are two major ones.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:90%
CME, mother nature.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Coronal Mass Ejection.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:90%
EMP-- electromagnetic pulse.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Man-made.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And they will fire
to other countries.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, how serious is
an EMP threat on you?

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:10%
Why don't somebody type in,
while y'all are sitting there--

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:10%
type in the Panama Canal.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And type in ship
found with missiles.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
There was a ship coming through
the Panama Canal from Cuba,

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:90%
on its way to North Korea.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with
hundred-pound bags of sugar.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Tons of it.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not a threat.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, we didn't
think it was either.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But when they go to find the
captain, they can't find him.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:84%
He's up in his
captain's office there.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So they run in and
see what he's doing.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting there with a
gun barrel in his mouth.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:10%
He's ready to kill himself.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:10%
What the hell is
he so scared of?

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:90%
He's hiding something.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So they pull the ship
over to the side.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:10%
They unload thousands
of bags of sugar.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:10%
Get all the way to the
bottom of the cargo bottom.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:10%
They find a false floor.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
They pull it out.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:90%
And guess what's laying there?

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Two Soviet SS-18 missiles.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they come from?

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Cuba.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:90%
1964 Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Where are they going?

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:90%
They're going to North Korea.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Call Little Rocket
Boy over there.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
He's going to strap on, instead
of nuclear weapons on it-- he's

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
going to load these two
rockets with EMP warheads.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Electromagnetic pulse warheads.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Then what'll do?

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Guess where the ship manifest
says it's going after all that?

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:90%
To Mexico City.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll take the two
missiles into Mexico,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
out in the desert
somewhere, and boom, boom.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.767 align:middle line:90%
They shoot them our way.

00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Just two of those-- explain--

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Just two of them.

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Just two-- explain, could
disable the entire United

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:90%
States of America.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Bring us down forever.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll shoot them down.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:90%
With what?

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:10%
In the southwest corner
of North America,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:10%
there is no missile
defense system.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:10%
We didn't think we'd need it.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting there with
a big hole, vulnerable.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, missile boy.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Here he comes.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Here comes the two missiles.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
They get in one over
Missouri, one over Arkansas.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in there, in
the middle of the country,

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
at about a 300,
400 mile altitude.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:90%
You won't even hear the boom.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
You might see a flash of light,
think it's just lightning

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> This is not a nuclear bomb.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.285 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.473 align:middle line:84%
>> So this EMP charge
is coming down.

00:20:29.473 --> 00:20:32.015 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll know something's
up when all the lights flash

00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and they go out.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.775 align:middle line:84%
Then we're back to
that crazy scenario

00:20:35.775 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I just said where
transformers will explode.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Aircraft will drop down.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:90%
So everything is on fire.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:90%
We're burning up.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.017 align:middle line:90%
The grid's knocked out.

00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be--
when it's knocked out

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
like that, one of the line
men will be out there,

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and like normal when
a storm comes by.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And in a couple days,
they got power back up.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:90%
What's the big deal?

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:90%
This is not that.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
That's an orange.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:90%
This is an apple.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are you so compassionate
about this, David?

00:21:02.092 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I don't want
you people to get hurt.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:90%
I really like all of you.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean die.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.078 align:middle line:84%
You know, I really
like you people.

00:21:08.078 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't want y'all to get hurt.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:90%
And I like you Democrats.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:90%
I like you Republicans.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:90%
And the independents.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not political.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
This should be a
bipartisan thing.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to die if
we don't work together.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to see
y'all go through this.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:90%
I want to make sure you're safe.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:90%
And the way to do that--

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:90%
you know what, the sanctuary--

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.320 align:middle line:90%
spot.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure you
got a sanctuary spot.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't
do something about it,

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
your sanctuary is going
to burn into toast.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not science fiction.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not made up.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:90%
This is as real as real gets.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's your strategy
going to be to accomplish this?

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't seem to
get headway in America.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'll tell you what.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to leave this country.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to
the Middle East.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:10%
But what I'll do there is going
to put so much pressure back

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:10%
this way, gonna force
those idiots in DC

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:10%
to do something for you.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:90%
They won't do their jobs.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
force them with a crowbar

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:84%
to do their jobs, to
protect you people.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that's
out of our technological reach.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned, this
is 1950s technology.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:10%
And you know, how real
of a threat is it?

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
There are people
coming for you all.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, what are we talking about?

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Silicon Valley.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Type that into
the damn internet.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Read up on a substation
in Silicon Valley.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Look what happened.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
That station was sitting
there real quiet.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.333 align:middle line:90%
And these men showed up.

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Might have been women.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't know.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But whoever they were,
they were highly organized,

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:90%
and real smart.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:84%
First thing they did, they
took out the security cameras.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Guns with silencers.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Cut the chains, went
into the substation.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:90%
They shot transformers.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I ain't talking
about a transformer,

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%
that thing on a pole.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a transformer
the size of a gymnasium.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And they shot 15 of them up.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.883 align:middle line:90%
Millions of dollars of damage.

00:23:13.883 --> 00:23:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how long
it takes to replace

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:90%
a transformer that size?

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
You put your order in to
either China or West Germany.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.125 align:middle line:84%
And in two years, you
get your transformer.

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you shouldn't
be ordering your transformers

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.468 align:middle line:90%
from two countries.

00:23:27.468 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:10%
You should have a
manufacturing plant right

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:10%
in the center of
the country that

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.038 align:middle line:10%
can feed backup transformers.

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> David, how long would it
take to implement your plan

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
of the new grid in the
United States of America?

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We could do the entire North
American continent in less than

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:90%
a year and a half.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's not much.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty quick.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
That's very fast.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Very quick.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not inventing
new technology.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.230 align:middle line:84%
We're just using old
stuff off the shelf.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, explain that
science to the viewers here.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're using things like
capacitors, surge protectors,

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Faraday cages, which is just
metal nets over devices,

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:90%
to keep the EMP pulse waves off.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Or the CME.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
You get two for
one in this case.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Diverters, where things get too
loaded, you switch over to this

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and share the loads.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Simple things like that,
once they're in place,

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:90%
your grid's hardened.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It can take--

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> How many attacks can it take?

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as you keep the
equipment we put in maintained,

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:90%
like anything.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.527 align:middle line:84%
You buy a car, you got to
tune it up now and then.

00:24:34.527 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:90%
You got to change the oil on it.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.457 align:middle line:84%
It's the maintenance
all the time.

00:24:37.457 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Just do maintenance on it.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Forever.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Indefinite.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Hit after hit after hit.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:90%
It'll still work.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
I had to argue so

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
hard to get somebody to
do something so simple

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:90%
to save your lives.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I was called by the
governor of Texas.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember
your history,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Texas used to be
its own country.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:90%
It was a republic.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:90%
The Republic of Texas.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, those
Texans down there,

00:25:07.508 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:84%
you can say what
you want about them.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But you know, Davy Crockett,
Jim Bowie, that crowd.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:90%
They're still alive down there.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And he heard about me
struggling so hard.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we're not going to
want to wait for Washington DC

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:90%
idiots to decide what to do.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.720 align:middle line:84%
We want to harden
the grid of Texas.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I went, really?

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.415 align:middle line:90%
>> We could do that.

00:25:31.415 --> 00:25:32.215 align:middle line:90%
How much?

00:25:32.215 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.766 align:middle line:90%
$1 billion.

00:25:36.766 --> 00:25:37.938 align:middle line:90%
$1 billion?

00:25:37.938 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We've got people down
here with checkbooks.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.355 align:middle line:84%
They could write a
billion dollar check

00:25:41.355 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:90%
and not even miss it.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'll come down there, and
I'll harden your grid in Texas.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So when the lights
go out over here,

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and everything is on fire,
Texas is sitting there

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:90%
with its lights on and no fire.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone's going
to flood to Texas.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:90%
But who would rule America?

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Texas.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like that thought,
then get the whole grid fixed.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, stop sitting there
and not doing anything.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But the Texans want
to do something.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to the
Mid-East to do that part.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to come
back and do Texas.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Because then I've done Texas,
I'm doing the Middle East.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting DC between
them like a vise,

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and turning it until we
bust them like a grape.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And get this thing done and
get you people protected.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- look it
up on the internet.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.580 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of articles
written about what I'm just

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:90%
telling you that backs me up.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
26 different agencies, all
come to the same conclusion.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's one of
the worst problems you

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:90%
could face for your existence.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, y'all hardly
know anything about it.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think we're
putting it on the back-burner?

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.863 align:middle line:84%
>> I wish I knew
the answer to that.

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't-- it's hard for me to
believe that just one person is

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:90%
holding this whole thing up.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.500 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It's more than one.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a group of politicians.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And if the one person would be--
if it's a group of politicians,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:90%
it's one thing.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:10%
DC is holding this up.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:10%
And they're like a
bunch of little kids

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:10%
up there, screaming and
crying and throwing tantrums,

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:10%
not getting what they want.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But they're making
you pay the price.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:84%
They're rolling the dice
with your life, your kids,

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.275 align:middle line:90%
your family, everybody.

00:27:27.275 --> 00:27:29.517 align:middle line:84%
>> So their benefit
is really just money.

00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It doesn't even
make sense on that.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:10%
Because the amount
of money that's

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:10%
involved is insignificant to
what they spend every day.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:84%
They spend every day the
amount that you would

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:90%
need to fix all this with.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe if I
keep bitching and raising

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:84%
enough ruckus, somebody'll
get tired of hearing me

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and go, give him his damn money,
and let him fix this thing,

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:90%
so he'd go away.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
At least I know
y'all will be fine.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
When the CME comes rolling
in from mother nature,

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:01.195 align:middle line:84%
or an EMP comes in from
an attacking country,

00:28:01.195 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I know you guys are going
to weather this thing OK.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you protect the
vehicles and the airplanes?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Faraday cages.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm
guessing at this.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:90%
I just know.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Boy, I don't want you people
to have to face that burning

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:90%
inferno they're talking about.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
There's been books
written about this.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:84%
One famous book-- boy,
that's a sobering account.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And he's got all, in the back
of the book, all the people that

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:90%
verified all this.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one group saying
this is going to happen.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It's bipartisan.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, both parties
know about this.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But they're just
sitting on their butts.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
it is with y'all.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the American
people deserve better.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
God almighty, y'all have paid
so much money for so much stuff,

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:90%
and have gotten crap.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, give you something
that you can protect yourselves

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And I go over to
the Middle East--

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:84%
if I can get America
hardened, I'm not

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:90%
stopping here at America, man.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm stomping across the planet.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't have
any continent on fire.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going throw up so
much smoke, we lose the Sun.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:90%
All plant life dies.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:90%
All animal life dies.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's a planet-wide
thing, human race thing.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It's every human being on a
blue-white marble called Earth.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're going through space
at 100,000 miles an hour,

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're all traveling
together on the same thing.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And just to let this stuff go--

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's a sin.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
It just makes sense.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Fix the thing and upgrade it.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy to do.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And we ain't talking 50 years.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.608 align:middle line:84%
Can do it in about
a year and a half.

00:29:51.608 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a
win-win for everyone.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> If we just get this done.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it eliminates us from
having the grid shut down.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Because when that
grid goes down, buddy,

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
that's when the party starts.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a party
you want to be in.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Because people without food
and water is horrendous.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84%
If you don't think
that's bad, you

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.137 align:middle line:84%
talk to people who
survived in New Orleans

00:30:17.137 --> 00:30:18.470 align:middle line:90%
when they had no food and water.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That was rough.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk to the people that
were in the Superdome.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not funny.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, all
the sanitation stops.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Commodes don't flush anymore.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Backs up.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Runs all over the ground.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.263 align:middle line:84%
So you die from
diseases, exposure.

00:30:35.263 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Disease and famine, yeah.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And I can just go on and on.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, you don't
have to go this route.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:90%
We have a solution to fix it.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.710 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't cost that much money.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It won't take that much time.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can implement it
and stop worrying about it.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>> David, you're
blowing us away.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic information.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you definitely
have the solution for this.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And you have the biggest
heart that I've ever

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:90%
seen on this planet.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And we thank you for that.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for
being on the show.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Glad to be here.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I just hope you guys listen.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Man, I want to help y'all.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And until next time, be safe.
