>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure",

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy
Cramer, who is sharing

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:10%
his experiences from his time
in a Secret Space Program.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.995 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.537 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:30.337 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What types of
advanced technologies,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
from ET and humans,
have you worked

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
with that the general population
doesn't have access to?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, probably the
majority of those technologies

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
involve either propulsion
systems, energy generation

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
systems, weapons systems,
directed energy or particle

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
beam weapon technology,
computer technology,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
quantum computer technology,
artificial intelligence

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:90%
technology, psionic amplifiers.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
bulk of it, right there.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're telling me
that everything surrounding us

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.545 align:middle line:84%
right now, all
these electronics,

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:04.015 align:middle line:84%
we weren't smart enough
to really make on our own?

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would
say we probably

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.138 align:middle line:84%
had help somewhere
in the beginning,

00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:90%
but we're quick learners.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So as-- it's also,
I think, important

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
to note that we have some very
intelligent people working

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.273 align:middle line:84%
on these things who just
needed to be shown the path so

00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that they could, you know, start
to carve their own way through.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing a very
good job right now

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
of developing that
technology on our own

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:90%
to some very advanced levels.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.812 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, in the
beginning, you know,

00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
we had to have someone kind
of show us the general basics.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.377 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You did mention
the energetic beam weapon.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Was that, like, a scalar
interferometry type thing, or--

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That would be
a directed energy weapon

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:90%
of a type--

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can be
lasers, masers,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
anything that's a focused
energy beam that's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
designed to increase the
joules or heat of the energy

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
to make it
weaponizable is-- yeah,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
qualifies as a
directed energy weapon.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What types
of technologies,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.038 align:middle line:84%
like our everyday carry
items, like your cell phones

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and things like this,
that you can mention,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that are possibly
reverse-engineered

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial technology?

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, definitely
microelectronics,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
which essentially--
the only reason

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
we've been able to do
microelectronics to the level

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
we are is something called
circuitry fractalization.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're taking a circuit,
and instead of making it have

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:84%
the sort of same distinct
geometric shapes that we are

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
familiar with from the '50s and
'60s, they use fractal patterns

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to magnify the ability for
a very tiny piece of metal

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:90%
to receive--

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:90%
well, as an anntena.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So an antenna in a
cell phone, you know,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
is this tiny because it's a
fractalized piece of metal,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:84%
which gives it the ability to
absorb just thousands of times

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.203 align:middle line:90%
more waves per cubic millimeter.

00:02:47.203 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
any other types

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
besides these antennas
and other things?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I know I've heard of, you know,
infrared goggles and things

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Sure, I mean, I think
most of the advanced night

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
vision technology certainly came
from that kind of technology.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
We used a sonar device
that used sound waves

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to project an image inside
the HUD of the helmet.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:90%
You know, basically like--

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
it was sonar, I mean,
it was active sonar

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.163 align:middle line:84%
from the body armor
projecting out

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:84%
into the world
that could give you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.328 align:middle line:84%
a complete 3D
image on the inside

00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:90%
of the HUD of the helmet.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
As well, I know
that, like, cruise

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
missiles, rocket technology,
some of the advanced bombers

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:90%
and so forth are using--

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
like, they're not
necessarily being

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
powered by overunity
generators, but they're

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
using overunity generators to
power certain components, which

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:90%
is very interesting.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.285 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the
audience, why don't we

00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
describe a little bit more,
like, what is a overunity?

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Overunity is
basically the description

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
of a device which produces more
energy than you put into it.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So one of our main holdbacks
to the 20th century

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
was how much energy you
have to put into something

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:90%
to get out of it.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But an overunity device, you can
put very little energy into it

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and produce, in some cases,
thousands of times more energy

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:90%
than you used to start up with.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:90%
So we don't necessarily--

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people like to
use the words "free energy,"

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
but an overunity device
isn't free energy.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
It's overunity, so it's
producing more energy

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:90%
than you put into it.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there technologies
that the ETs intentionally

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:90%
gave us, and why?

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Sure, I mean, I think
some of the early propulsion

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
systems, the early
electrogravitic technology,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%
magnetogravitic
technology, definitely

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:90%
came from extraterrestrials.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:10%
I know some people
historically want

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:10%
to say that we recovered,
you know, this ship off

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:10%
the California coast after
the Battle of Los Angeles,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:10%
but we're pretty sure that we
didn't find it so much that it

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:10%
fell off the back of a truck.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.355 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Was given to us in that
way, was just sort of

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:84%
handed to us so that
we could balance out

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
the technological
competition with the Nazis

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and what they were doing,
and saucer craft technology.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've been on
some retrieval crash team

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
sites where it looked like
it was intentionally crashed

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
or made to be shot down,
and the beings on there

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:90%
were not real beings.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So that would
kind of insinuate,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe they sent these cybernetic
organisms with this craft

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.155 align:middle line:84%
to help us evolve a
little bit faster.

00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is that possible?

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, based on what I've been
briefed on these subjects,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
we have been handed
things over time in a way,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
like I said, that looked like
it fell off the back of a truck

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of, you know, oh, here,
we're handing this to you.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, we lost that.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you found it.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.142 align:middle line:90%
So you know, it's--

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because many
people are always asking,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, did my cell phone
come from reverse technology,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, reverse-engineered
technology from another race?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.598 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what people
really need to look at

00:05:55.598 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is not just the
final end product,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
but the amazing manufacturing of
materials that come from space

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:90%
that are used now.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's new materials that
keep coming out every year,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.453 align:middle line:84%
out of nowhere, that people
are mixing different elements

00:06:11.453 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
together and forming
things, which

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I think is in direct correlation
with a corporation that

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:84%
has already used something
they acquired for two decades.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe now they're releasing
it slowly to the public

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to make a jacket.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.638 align:middle line:84%
So you know, that's
again just getting

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of a leg up.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having to develop
every single unknown alloy,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
we get handed a few alloys
and break them apart,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and then learn the secrets
of putting them together.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The cool thing about
alloys is that you

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
take two different materials
and you blend them together,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.575 align:middle line:84%
and you create
something that has

00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:90%
completely unique properties.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So it really is a
mathematical blending

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
of so many different
possibilities

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that we could spend a very
long time studying alloys

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and never get to the
really good ones.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's been definitely helpful
that some other people have

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
come along and said, ah
yeah, try this alloy.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And you know, maybe you want
this as your superconductor.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have we ever
given back technologies

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrials or
given our own technology

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:90%
that we solely came up with?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm not
so sure about that.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.503 align:middle line:84%
I do know that when we master
some of these materials

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
technologies, we

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
manufacture them better
than some other species do.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So we turn around and
certainly sell them back

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
end products that
we manufacture,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
that are manufactured better
than some of the tools

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:90%
that they make.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it's because of a
convenience factor for them?

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.918 align:middle line:84%
We just make something better,
and that's why they utilize us?

00:07:43.918 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We don't have
anything that they

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:90%
want that they don't have?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Other than
genetic material

00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and/or possibly certain, you
know, rare elements, maybe,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that appear more in
our asteroid belt,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:90%
as far as mining is concerned.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Something that we may
have more of like cadmium.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I know that we have
a lot of cadmium out

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:84%
in the asteroid belt, maybe more
than some other species have,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
so it's cheaper for them
to buy our mined cadmium

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.387 align:middle line:90%
than it is to mine their own.

00:08:17.387 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, in some ways,
there are other species

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.428 align:middle line:90%
that do the same thing.

00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They're able to mine a
mineral that's cheaper for us

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.095 align:middle line:84%
to buy from them than
it is to mine ourselves.

00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are the technologies
different from civilization

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:90%
to civilization?

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Interestingly enough,
a lot of the fundamentals

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:90%
are very much the same.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:84%
What really changes
is the application.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, a
magnetogravitic propulsion

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
system that we build,
we could compare

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
to 10 other magnetogravitic
propulsion systems that

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
are built by other
species and see

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:84%
how the science is the same, and
see how the basic engineering

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
is the same.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes,
the application is

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
just, you know, night
and day difference as far

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
as how that species took
the same math, science,

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and engineering and just
turned it into something

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:84%
completely different that does
essentially the same thing,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
but in a way that we would
never do or never thought of.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's just more than
one road that leads to Rome.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
There's more than one
way to do something,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and you can develop a tool
that is night and day, almost,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
from another tool that still
does the same job because it's

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:90%
using the same principles.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
it, you're looking

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
at two things that are just
created and built in two

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:90%
completely different ways.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
ever experienced

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
while on other civilizations
and other planets that you've

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
visited something there that
you saw that triggered something

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in your mind to say,
oh, my goodness,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
this looks just like
a hammer from Earth.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Or something that, you
know, you could relate to,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of device
that we had on the planet,

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.043 align:middle line:90%
that you've seen off-planet?

00:09:56.043 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, I can
actually remember,

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
when I was staying with family
in the Cassiopeian system,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
there was actually some
guys that were doing repair

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:90%
work on a house next door.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was super curious to
see what they were using,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
what tools they were using,
whether they were using hand

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
tools or whether it was all
machine tools or something

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:90%
completely different.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And what I thought was
absolutely fascinating

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
was that a pair of pliers,
screwdriver, hammer--

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
slightly different design,
but same essential physics

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was interesting to
see very similar things being

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
used in a slightly different
way that, you know,

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
just basic tools
that we use, that

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
has been around for hundreds
or even thousands of years.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There was
one time at a site

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
we found what looked
to be, like, a drill,

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:90%
but it was all one piece.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
There was no screws
or bolts on it.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.237 align:middle line:84%
It was just one
fluid, amazing piece.

00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, saws and drills.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Very common, very common.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, that other
species use-- you know,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
bladed saws and drills
to make holes and things,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:90%
cut things in half.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.652 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:02.652 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you describe
the technologies used

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to travel into space that
they use and that we use,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:90%
and the differences?

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, certainly
the spacecraft technology

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is based on similar
fundamental engineering.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But I guess in the
same way that--

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have a certain flavor
or a certain sense of the way

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%
we like to build things.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
We have a preference for the way
we like to design and construct

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
things, our engineers,
of a certain way

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that they like to
put things together.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
differences there.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that's usually
the major difference.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:84%
If I was to be on a terrestrial
ship or an alien ship,

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:84%
what I would be looking at
as differences are mostly

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
window dressing, finish work
almost, or what might even

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:84%
come down to the style
of the way someone

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
chooses to manufacture
or build something.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you get right down
to the basic fundamentals,

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
so much of it is
just almost the same

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
because the physics are
just very fundamental.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:90%
They're very basic.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
There's not 29 ways to use
physics as a propulsion system.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
There's, you know,
less than a dozen that

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
we're aware of that we can use
to make propulsion systems.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And we find those repeat
over and over and over again.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How large are
these propulsion units?

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: They vary.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The biggest one I've ever
seen was probably, maybe,

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:90%
30 feet in diameter.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Smallest one I've ever seen,
about the size of a coffee can.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.832 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And this could probably
power the whole planet, maybe.

00:12:31.832 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, goodness.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something-- I've
seen power generators,

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, the size
of a basketball that

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
could probably power a
major US city and generators

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the size of this room that could
power half the planet, yeah.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly efficient,
incredibly efficient.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can you tell
us about portal technologies?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, not a
lot, other than what I've

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:90%
experienced on the user end.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So my experience of it is, you
know, an opening opens up here.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I go through.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.633 align:middle line:90%
I end up on the other end.

00:13:04.633 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Does it hurt?

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
There is some disorientation
because you're

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:84%
going through a field in which
the gravitational field is not

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.913 align:middle line:84%
the same because you're no
longer standing on the planet.

00:13:17.913 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer standing
on a gravitational source.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:90%
You're in between.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So there is an inner
ear disturbance, where--

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
for me, personally--
where it feels

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
like sort of being turned inside
out and spun around and around

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and around and around
before you come out.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're trained when we
go through these things

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to, like, step briskly
forward and not stop.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Because if you stop while you're
in the middle of the wormhole,

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.918 align:middle line:84%
you'll kind of get
stuck, and someone

00:13:44.918 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:84%
will have to come from
behind and push you,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:90%
which can be dangerous.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the event
horizons of these things

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:84%
can be fatal, so you don't want
to, like, touch the edge of it

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:84%
or get your arm
caught on the edge

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.453 align:middle line:84%
because it could just
slice off a body part.

00:13:57.453 --> 00:13:59.328 align:middle line:84%
So you really want to
be in the middle of it,

00:13:59.328 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
so you just kind of have to
go through really quickly.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But you experience
a disorientation

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that just feels like
kind of blackness,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
turning over and over and over
again, and then popping out.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people have a recovery
period that can be--

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.458 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'd say 1 to 5 minutes
if they've never really been

00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
through it before, and if you've
been through it a few times,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that goes down and
down, and I would

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
say after going through a
jumpgate a few dozen times,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, my disorientation
when I come out the other end

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:84%
is maybe 5 to 10
seconds, you know,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:90%
where I have to stand still.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's a vertigo sense
of kind of spinning that--

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
again, from the inner ear-- that
stops in about 5 or 10 seconds.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, these jumpgates
that we're talking about,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.410 align:middle line:84%
are they accessible to the
world leaders of the planet

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.962 align:middle line:90%
or military?

00:14:49.962 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Some of them.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Jumpgates are definitely
high-level-access technologies,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:84%
so there are personnel that have
access to spaceships and space

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
travel through spaceships
that do not have access

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
to jumpgate technology.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So jumpgate technology is
definitely top-tier technology,

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:84%
so used only for the efficiency
of military transportation

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
or the highest level
bureaucratic or government

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:90%
personnel.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
technologies have

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
you discovered that were
just mindblowing to you,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that was just-- it stood out
compared to everything else?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So there is a
species who make spaceships out

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.627 align:middle line:90%
of a Dyson sphere.

00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And for those who don't
know, a Dyson sphere

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is essentially an
engineered construct

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
that goes around a star.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So think of a star like our sun
in the middle and an engineered

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:90%
sphere around it.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the ship
that uses the star

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in the middle as the
engine power source

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and as the source of power
for a directed weapon.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Which-- so you're
thinking about it

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
as a ship that's bigger than
Jupiter and bigger than the sun

00:15:54.910 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and can travel untold distances
and have a directed beam

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
weapon that's
powered and focused

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
from a star that could evaporate
entire planets, if need be.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who has access to that?

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There's only
one species that I'm

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:90%
aware of that have these.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:90%
They're the Trogdabogdians.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The planet is called Trogda,
and the star is Bogdia.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you have
experience with them?

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I've talked to them.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
We've communicated.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.933 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What kind of
species that are they?

00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They evolved
from a tree frog,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
so they probably stand between
4 and 1/2, 5 feet tall.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Their head is actually
probably more than a third

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:90%
of their full body proportions.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:84%
They have a gigantic head, a
pretty small body, big eyes.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
They come from a
red star system.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So again, very big eyes because
of the lower light level.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Hyperintelligent, lifespan
in the millions of years.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very evolved beings.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.505 align:middle line:90%
Very conscious, it sounds.

00:16:57.505 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Of the two
most evolved species

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I've ever encountered,
they are one.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm assuming the
sun goes with them wherever

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:90%
they go.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.813 align:middle line:84%
It's in the middle of
the ship all the time.

00:17:06.813 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why would
they develop this?

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, my
understanding was, they

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
wanted to conduct large
explorations through space

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:90%
from galaxy to galaxy to galaxy.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.339 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to have a completely
self-contained ship that

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:84%
had everything that they could
possibly ever need or require

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:90%
on that ship.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are some big,
dangerous things out there.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:84%
They wanted big firepower
in case they ran into--

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't know, a planet-sized
destroyer of some kind,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
which according to them,
they have run into.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're not hostile,
nor are they threatening.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted
the biggest ship

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
to travel in the
farthest distances that

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
could take the
longest amount of time

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and be completely and
ready and prepared

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to defend themselves against
anything and everything.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
They-- maybe put it this way.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to go in
space with the highest

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.030 align:middle line:84%
probability of their
success and the lowest

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
probability of any
failure whatsoever,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
so they built the biggest
ship, with the biggest engine,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
with the biggest
weapon that they could.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you seen
schematics of this,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:90%
or on a computer or something?

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I've never
seen schematics,

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
but in a psionic telepathic
conversation with this species,

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
it was downloaded, a bunch of
images, and what I would say

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.888 align:middle line:84%
was a progressive series of
images of the construction.

00:18:25.888 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So you know, like,
where they sort of

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
start with the
pieces of the frame,

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:84%
how they put it together,
and, you know, what sort of--

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
what it takes to get to
the finished product.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying to
this being, I was like,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:90%
wow, that's incredible.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it must take
a really long time

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:90%
to build one of those.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, eh, only
about 186,000 of your years.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, the notion that a
species could be that focused

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
on a goal for that long
of an amount of time

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and be that dedicated
to the end result

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.858 align:middle line:90%
was just mindblowing to me.

00:18:58.858 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Eh, it would only
take us-- you know,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.108 align:middle line:84%
we'll be done in less
than 200,000 years.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:90%
No biggie.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How do they get around?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They build the
Dyson sphere around the star

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
wherever the star is,
and once the Dyson sphere

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
is built around the
star, it creates

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:84%
the most gigantic
magnetogravitic field ever,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
which essentially keeps those
two things in the same space

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:90%
as if it were one object.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, while
this is a ship that

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:27.853 align:middle line:84%
can move in an x, y, z axis,
pretty much it folds space.

00:19:27.853 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Enfolds on itself--

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it just--

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't even use a wormhole.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.528 align:middle line:84%
It folds space, and then it's
instantaneously somewhere else.

00:19:35.528 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- from
what I understand,

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
there's an instant where
it's two places at once,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
where it's in both
locations at the same time.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Bilocation.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, and then
they basically decide

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:84%
which of those two
places they want to be.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And then it's just in that spot.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, on your
expeditions and missions,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
were there some sort
of secret technology

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
they probably outfitted for
you, either for survival

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:90%
or to protect yourself?

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: As a soldier,
the primary tools

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
are a powered body armor, which
is essentially an exosuit,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
so it's got hydraulic
augmentation in the arms

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and the legs, so you
can lift larger objects,

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:90%
jump much farther.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's the main tool
that wraps around your body

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to protect you and
give you more mobility.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, typically,
for a sidearm weapon

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
is either a railgun
or a plasma rifle.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I probably used a railgun
more than I have used a plasma

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
rifle, but depending
on the situation,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:84%
it was usually either
one or the other.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you explain to
the audience what a railgun is?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.693 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure, I'll do my best.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So if the barrel
of the gun is here,

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
you have a series
of electromagnets

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
all in a row that are
in the off position.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, as this electromagnetic
turns on, and then

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:90%
immediately that one turns off.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
The next one turns on, and
then that one turns off,

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:90%
and the next one turns on.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.353 align:middle line:84%
And that all happens
in a nanosecond.

00:20:55.353 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And so what it does is, it
creates a little magnetic field

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that it grabs the projectile
in and then hurls it

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
down the barrel and
fires it out the end.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So as opposed to a chemically
fired projectile, like a rifle,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:90%
there's no kick, very low heat.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:90%
You have incredible precision.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.437 align:middle line:84%
And again, the barrel's
not jumping around

00:21:15.437 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
like you have with a
machine gun or a rifle.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.478 align:middle line:90%
They're incredibly efficient.

00:21:18.478 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many rounds can
this shoot, and the distance,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.523 align:middle line:90%
too, of these railguns now--

00:21:23.523 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, well, I mean the
big railguns that they have

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:90%
on the ships--

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.952 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those things
shoot thousands of miles

00:21:28.952 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:90%
from what I understand.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in open space, you
can fire a railgun round

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.132 align:middle line:90%
thousands of miles.

00:21:35.132 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even sure what
the maximum distance is,

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
but you're talking
thousands of miles.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I know, on the ground, I
could fire a railgun shot,

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and I could hit a target
easily 1,000 yards,

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:84%
2,000 yards away with less
than a 6-inch drop over that

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
distance and hit a
target, you know,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that's this big around with
three shots successively--

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3-- every time.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Every time.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, is it also true
that most of these rounds

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
are not explosive
rounds because we just

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:84%
need a very heavy, you know,
tungsten-grade element, maybe.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: However you want
to put it-- a missile.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Really, there's nothing
in this because it's

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetism that's
shooting this projectile.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the velocity that
does the damage, right?

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, force equals mass
times velocity squared.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's that velocity squared
part, that when you really

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
increase the velocity
of the object,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that that force
increases exponentially.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you fire that object
hot enough and fast enough,

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.460 align:middle line:84%
it'll puncture through multiple
levels of armor plating,

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
through alloys, and do
incredible amounts of damage.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
They're an amazing
long-range weapon, for sure.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that reversed
alien technology?

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I mean, the
first railgun in a laboratory

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.950 align:middle line:84%
was probably done in the
late 1800s or early 1900s

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:84%
by early scientists
and engineers

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.762 align:middle line:84%
working in experiments
with electricity.

00:23:14.762 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking about
something that was in a lab,

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:90%
took a large power source.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I was in high school,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.572 align:middle line:84%
I had a physics instructor
that talked about, you know,

00:23:22.572 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
building a railgun
gun in the lab,

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and the big issue was
that you can make one,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's the power
source that you

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
need that makes them not
practical as a sidearm weapon.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So it took, certainly, advanced
technological development

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
to make them weaponizable
in the field.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
First, we used a battery,
essentially a really

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
high-density battery
that was probably,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, about
the size of a car

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
battery, that fit into the
backpack of the body armor.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But by the time that I was
done with my tour in the MDF,

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:84%
we shrunk down that
battery to fit right

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
into the stock of the rifle,
and you could get easily

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
several hours' worth
of power before you

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
needed a new battery, needed
to swap out a new battery.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.535 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
projectile made out of?

00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was an
alloy of some kind.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, about the size
of the tip of my thumb.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But again, made out of a
hardened alloy that was--

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:90%
again, an alloy that--

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
they weren't
uranium-tipped, and whatever

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
alloy they were made out of
could punch through just about

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:90%
anything like butter.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I'd never-- the only time
I'd ever seen them bounce off

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
anything was the first
time we encountered

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
the Draconians in battle,
and watching our projectiles

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:90%
bounce off of them.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So our combat engineers decided
to make a rifle with a bigger

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:84%
projectile, so we had an
11-millimeter projectile,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and then we went to a
22-meter projectile.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:90%
And the 22-meter projectile--

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
22-millimeter projectile,
sorry-- was very effective

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.405 align:middle line:84%
and would slice through
their armor like butter.

00:24:57.405 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell me more
about this plasma rifle

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and how it operates.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So
essentially, it again

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
is using a magnetic field to
hold a contained ball of plasma

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that then launches out the
end of the barrel super

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:90%
hot, super fast.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the range on a plasma
rifle is actually way less

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.050 align:middle line:84%
than a railgun, but at short
range, that plasma ball is

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:26.670 align:middle line:84%
going to hit, where
an alloy projectile

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
has to penetrate
matter-to-matter,

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
a hot ball of plasma
is thousands of degrees

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and basically melts
anything that it hits.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So unless the material has a
melting point that's higher

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
than, you know,
4,000, 5,000 degrees,

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.162 align:middle line:84%
it's going to hit that
and melt right through it.

00:25:48.162 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
ever seen someone

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.723 align:middle line:90%
get hit by a plasma rifle?

00:25:50.723 --> 00:25:51.765 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:51.765 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.107 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does it
disintegrate the whole body,

00:25:54.107 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:90%
or just make a hole?

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: No, it
just makes a hole.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, a plasma
ball this big will

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.857 align:middle line:90%
make a hole about that big.

00:26:00.857 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever
been up against an opponent

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and seen some technology
you just didn't understand?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: At first?

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:84%
The first encounter that
we had with the Draconians,

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:90%
they were--

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:84%
we noticed that there was,
like, a black, gray fog that

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
appeared-- almost looked
like a fog that would, like,

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
sort of ooze out of the
ships and would sort of move

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
into the field, and that
anytime that our personnel found

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
themselves within the space
of that sort of amorphous,

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:84%
gaseous substance, they would
become instantly terrified.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So it was some sort of an energy
field or a dark plasma field

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that was just filled with a
frequency of fear and terror,

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.932 align:middle line:84%
and so it would demoralize
troops, and sometimes--

00:26:48.932 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:90%
let me put it this way.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Veterans were less affected
by it than greenhorns.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Greenhorns would
sometimes just end up

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.432 align:middle line:84%
fetal position, on the ground,
crying for their mommies

00:26:57.432 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
the first time they
encountered it.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So the first time we
encountered that, I

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.160 align:middle line:90%
had no idea what it was.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea
what to do with it.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Over time, we employed
psionic specialists

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to use a counter-field to
that field that would push it

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
back and negate the effect.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you have
fear when you'd seen this?

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.845 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
experienced it--

00:27:20.845 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was it was this
feeling of deep unease.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, like,
nerves and anxiety

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.553 align:middle line:84%
like we're not used to
experiencing in the field.

00:27:32.553 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Did you get nausea?

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they gave us a
performance drug cocktail that

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:44.790 align:middle line:84%
would essentially delete fear,
anxiety in the combat realm,

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.010 align:middle line:84%
so you could rush
into a situation--

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:90%
no fear, no anxiety.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.120 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't care.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But this would
counteract that, and so

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.362 align:middle line:84%
you would just go from a place
of being super courageous

00:27:55.362 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and ready to go
and just, oh, crap.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to--

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could be a
form of psychotronics?

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm sure that it
was something like that.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
It was either directly
psionic or psychotronics.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:90%
One or the other.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And can you talk to the
audience about psychotronics,

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.440 align:middle line:90%
the definition of that?

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So a
psionic weapon would

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.810 align:middle line:84%
be one that is projected from
the mind of an organic being.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.830 align:middle line:84%
A psychotronic weapon is
going to use similar waveform

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
technology but from a
technological device that's

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.722 align:middle line:90%
not an organic brain.

00:28:24.722 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you ever
use technology that

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:90%
enhanced your combat skills?

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, we had psionic
amplifiers as a training tool,

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially something
that magnifies your own psionic

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:84%
waves to allow you to increase
your psionic output so that you

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:84%
can achieve certain
psionic effects, which--

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:84%
because with
psionics, you really

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
want to achieve a high belief,
high acceptance in the subject.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:90%
So with the sort of--

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.750 align:middle line:84%
they're not really so
much training wheels

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:84%
as they are rocket
boots, so to speak,

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:90%
that you're strapping on.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And so by having that
massively increased

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:84%
amount of psionic output,
you're able to achieve

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:84%
a psionic result much, much
faster and jump to psionic--

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to acceptance and high
belief much more quickly.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So as a training tool,
you can take someone

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that you want to train
into a psionic ability

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.608 align:middle line:84%
and rapidly advance that skill
using a psionic amplifier.

00:29:19.608 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
explain to the audience,

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.917 align:middle line:84%
maybe, some of the things
you endured and some

00:29:23.917 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:84%
of the things you
were exposed to that

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:84%
had to do with, you know,
consciousness-assisted

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
technology or bio-adaptable
technology, where it had

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to use your genetics
or just you,

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
because of the program or the
medication you were taking,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:90%
to operate?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:84%
In flight school, we were
trained to fly everything.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So there were a few
extraterrestrial vehicles

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, we used as
trainers and learned to fly,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:84%
which were essentially
an interfacing that

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:90%
was completely psionic.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you'd sit in a
chair, put your hands down

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.310 align:middle line:90%
in these little forms.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you would connect,
you know, completely

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:90%
integrated into the vehicle.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So the HUD would just sort of
appear in front of your face.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You could just see outside of
the vehicle all of a sudden.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:84%
All of the scanners,
weapons systems,

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.718 align:middle line:84%
were all just accessible in this
HUD that was right up in front

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:22.260 align:middle line:84%
your eyes that no one else could
see because it was connected

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.270 align:middle line:84%
right to your brain,
and was just sort

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.848 align:middle line:84%
of projecting it right
into your cerebral cortex.

00:30:26.848 --> 00:30:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So all you really had to
do was look at something

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and think about what
you wanted it to do,

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you would
activate that system.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It's very fast.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can ready a weapons
system or a defensive system

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.528 align:middle line:84%
three or four times
as quickly as you can,

00:30:41.528 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, operating something
with your hands that way.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah,
through my experience

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:84%
being on some of
these craft, it was

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:90%
like being next to your pet dog.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It felt like there was
really a being there

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that you're connected
to, and wherever

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.775 align:middle line:84%
you looked in this craft,
you could see outside.

00:30:57.775 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter where.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's projected
inside of you.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think there's
a misconception out there

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.950 align:middle line:84%
of people thinking you're going
in here with a steering wheel

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.848 align:middle line:84%
and flying and driving
these things around.

00:31:07.848 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work this way.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, not at all.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in fact, definitely
some of those vehicles,

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.400 align:middle line:84%
you can't fly them
without a minimal amount

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:20.288 align:middle line:84%
of psionic ability to interface
with the navigation system,

00:31:20.288 --> 00:31:21.580 align:middle line:90%
with the flight control system.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Of course, everything
that you've been involved with

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is amazing, but tell
us about something

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:84%
that sticks out that we could
use right now, here on Earth.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, a physically
harmonic water purification

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:84%
system that can take the most
filthy, polluted, contaminated

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
water with the most
foreign particulates in it

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.673 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into
pure H2O in seconds.

00:31:45.673 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, that would
do a lot of good here.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, with a
large enough emitter,

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:84%
you could convert millions
of gallons of ocean water

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
from a polluted,
filled with crap state

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.547 align:middle line:84%
into just, again,
just salt water.

00:31:59.547 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could it take
radiation out of the water?

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.850 align:middle line:84%
It would-- yeah, it basically
transmutes everything into just

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.700 align:middle line:84%
what you want it to
be, which in this case,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:90%
that emitter would be telling--

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:84%
like, if you were,
again, projecting

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.150 align:middle line:84%
at the ocean, that you
only want in the projected

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:84%
area of that field for there
to be salt water remaining,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
would just basically--

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.580 align:middle line:84%
would deconstruct at
a subatomic level,

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and the neutrons,
protons, and electrons

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:84%
would rearrange
themselves in such a way

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:84%
that all you'd have
left is salt water.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing technology.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's
fascinating, Randy.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Randy, thanks for
being on the show.
