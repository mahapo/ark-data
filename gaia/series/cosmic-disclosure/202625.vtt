00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are with Randy Cramer who

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.440 align:middle line:10%
claims to have participated in
a secret space program called

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:10%
the Earth Defense Force.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me, Emery.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
>> From your experience in
the Earth Defense Force,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.035 align:middle line:84%
what are avatars and what
way were you exposed to them?

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So essentially, an
avatar is like in the movie.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a teleoperated drone.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to break
it down super simple,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
if I go out to the
store and buy a drone,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I've got a control mechanism
and I have a remote drone

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:90%
of which I'm controlling.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, we're
talking about the drone

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:84%
being a biological
shell with a control

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
mechanism in the brain,
which is essentially

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
sending the same signals
from my brain to that brain

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
so the control mechanism,
the remote control

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
is my brain in a
teleoperation bed,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:84%
transmitting that signal to the
computer brain interface that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
then controls the biological
drone in exactly the same way

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.985 align:middle line:84%
that I would
control my own body.

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:29.145 align:middle line:84%
>> How long does it take
to grow these drones?

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Depends, but from
what I understand,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
most clones or biological drones
can be grown in a rapid like

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
acceleration process that can
take less than 72 hours from

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:90%
what I understand.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, are you feeling as
well the actions of the avatar,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.145 align:middle line:84%
such as if the avatar broke
his leg, do you feel that pain?

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's a two-way
sensory experience.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Meaning I am feeling the
sensory experience of the drone.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
If the drone gets stabbed,
hit, burn, I feel that.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
If it gets bone
broken, I feel that.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, nothing actually
happens to my physical body

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:90%
but you feel the experience.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:90%
It still hurts, yeah.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, from what I have
gathered in the projects,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
they have informed me that
it's not a direct line of sight

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
It's somehow through
with infra-space,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
where the messages
and the connection--

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is it a conscious
connection or more

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of an electrical scientific
frequency connection?

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>> It's technological.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
The cerebral interface
is a piece of hardware.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that
it's used a sub-EMF frequency

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
or what is often referred
to as a subspace frequency.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's not using
what is we think

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
of as the normal
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
but it is using a
signal that can, yeah,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
transmit for hundreds or
even thousands of miles.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So that you could be aboard a
ship, in orbit, teleoperating

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
a biological drone on
the surface of the planet

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, could you actually
operate more than one?

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Not me personally
that I have ever done.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I am to understand that
there are extraterrestrials

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
who use this same technology who
have the ability and the brain

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
power to control multiple
drones at the same time.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
As the technology that we
originally saw from the Zetas

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:90%
using it.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Often when they come to visit
or extract someone or abduct

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:84%
someone, they're not
actually physically present.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They're teleoperating
a biological drone

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases, they're able
to control five or six drones

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
at a time for one
cerebral consciousness.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Do these avatar drones
have a central nervous system?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Do they have a digestive system?

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to eat while
you're in these avatars?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:90%
What's the lifespan of the body?

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're basically a
clone, and so they have every

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
biological, neurobiological
function that a normal living

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
organism of that
species would have.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, central nervous system,
organs, digestive system.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:90%
You have to stay hydrated.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
You may have to consume
protein or food depending

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
on how long you're
away for somewhere,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:90%
how long the mission is.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they're like a body
that you have to maintain.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I've also heard that
sometimes when the drone is

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:84%
killed and you're back in your
body that sometimes you have

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
a memory deficit that you
only remember maybe 20% or 30%

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:90%
of what had happened.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes you don't
recall the mission.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.045 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> So there is a buffer.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting that
you would bring that up.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
There is a buffer in
the cerebral interface

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
so that everything that's
happening in that brain

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
is being stored locally
in the drone that is then

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
getting transmitted
back to your body

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
as the data stream has
the allowable bandwidth

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible to have
the body be damaged and find

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
yourself back in your own
body before the buffer has

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
had its chance to upload
back to your body.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you might miss some
gaps, what was just happening?

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:90%
I remember something but--

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I got my arm blown off,
but where was I again?

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it can be a
little confusing

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
if you have a
sudden break, cause

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:90%
a sudden break with the drone.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
You can come back and be
a little discombobulated.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.265 align:middle line:84%
Again, because there's
a memory buffer.

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Can it also
cause PTSD later on?

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it was an experience
that you actually experienced.

00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, it qualifies
as actual real experience

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
for your own brain in your
own body because you are

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
experiencing a whole series
of memories and sensory inputs

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that are real and legitimate
and get transferred back

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:90%
to your brain.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
If they don't get transferred
back to your brain, then yeah,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:84%
there can be some memory
shock and some PTSD issues

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
with not being able
to fully remember

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
a traumatic event which
is one of the reasons

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
why we get PTSD because
we repressed the memories

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and not being able
to remember is

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
part of the thing that
traumatizes people, anyway.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I've also heard that
you can also be transferred

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
into the opposite
sex of a person.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that-- was that real?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it doesn't matter what
the gender of the biological

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:90%
drone is.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
You can still be
teleoperating into that drone.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, gender is not an issue.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> What about species?

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this is--

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
one of the main reasons
why we use this technology

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
is when we have to
interact with a system

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
where the atmosphere or gravity
is more hostile than is deemed

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:90%
appropriate to use battle suit.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So especially in higher
gravity, planetary systems

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
with really toxic gases or
acid-oriented vapor clouds

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and things that are perfectly
breathable and habitable

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to the species that are
there which are hostile to us

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and to our equipment,
it makes more sense

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's more effective
to teleoperate

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
into that biological
extraterrestrial body

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:84%
so that you're interacting with
the gravity and the environment

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that that biology is
designed to interact with.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're not as hampered
by the gravity issues that

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
can hamper technology
or machine parts,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and you're not hampered
by gaseous acidic basic

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
interactions with
the materials that

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:84%
also are more of a problem with
something that's technological.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the
biology of something

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
that's meant to be in that
environment, it's more durable.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>> How many interfaces have
you done during this avatar

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, probably
more than a dozen.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And what type of
species were they?

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> A number of different types.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Some which I would have to
simply describe as stranger

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
than just about
anything I had ever

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
experienced until that time
at which I experienced it.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say taking over
different species' body is like

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
maybe learning a new car and its
controls because I do realize

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that the bodies are not the
same as far as digits, arm,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
joint movements, you might have
an extra additional appendages,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:90%
or a tail.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.465 align:middle line:84%
Is that difficult
to learn right away?

00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It's tricky.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.815 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
a training period

00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
have to go through

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.857 align:middle line:84%
if it's the first
time that you've

00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
used that particular
biological drone form.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have the ability to set
up an obstacle course which

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
they can change the
gravity, can change

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
the breathable environment
to match whatever it needs to

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:90%
for whatever biological being.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So for teleoperating something
that comes from a gravity,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
planet that's 2.5G
and breathes methane,

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and you can set up the obstacle
course for the gravity plating

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
to be pulling at 2.5G and mix
the gaseous environment to be

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
breathable, and then you would
run the obstacle course as many

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
times until you're given a pass
on the amount of time that you

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
can do it based on the
body that you're doing.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So oh yeah, you have
to relearn how to walk,

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
how to stabilize your
gravity, how your upper body,

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:90%
lower body moves.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how many
fingers and toes you have

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:84%
will affect how you grab
things, how you step.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, the gravity is an
interesting thing so even

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
in a body that's
designed to move in 2.5G,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:84%
it still feels weird
to move in 2.5G.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So it feels heavier
but you also feel

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
like you're in a
body that's stronger

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't even out to feel
the same as in this body in 1G.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So it is a different sensory
experience being in that body

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and it takes some
training before you're

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
ready to be deployed
on a mission.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So we would spend
usually at least 50

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
or 60 hours of training time
before we would get deployed

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.143 align:middle line:90%
in a new biological drone form.

00:10:31.143 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
If it was something we were
familiar with we'd still spend

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.185 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of training time to
make sure that we were getting

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:84%
a pass, go/no-go check off on
the box before we were ready

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:90%
to be deployed.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's a
pretty weird experience

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.033 align:middle line:84%
and that's coming
from someone who

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:49.325 align:middle line:90%
had a lot of weird experiences.

00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about the linguistics

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:84%
because the vocal
cords are different

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
and also I have
heard that the eyes,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
you might be seeing a lot
more different spectrums

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:90%
than you're normally seeing.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I heard that you have to
go through special testing

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and training just to do that.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Or do they have some
sort of vocal device

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.575 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to
speak and understand

00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
or you're just doing
a bunch of clicks?

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So the cerebral interface,
because it's connected

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
to the physical drone body
in a way that it's designed

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to interact with it,
it has a translator.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
It essentially is taking
whatever information

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
from my brain into
the cerebral interface

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and then translating that
so that there's a pretty

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:90%
good language translator.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So I could think in English
and the biological body

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:84%
would speak the language that
the physical body of that

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:84%
species is prone to because
the cerebral interface has

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
translate automatically.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with audio.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So I will hear someone
speak something

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and then there is an immediate
translation which translates it

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
into English into what
I'm hearing in my brain.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And as far as senses
are concerned, yeah,

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you might have eyes
that are seeing

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
different in the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So there is some adapting
time to smell, sight, hearing.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
You might be hearing in
higher and lower registers.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
You may have longer,
longsight vision.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And you may be seeing an
infrared, ultraviolet cosmic

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:84%
radiation, X-rays, depending
on how that eyeball works.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
kind of adapt to that.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.423 align:middle line:90%
It can be a little freaky.

00:12:46.423 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how
else to say that.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.673 align:middle line:84%
It can be a little
freaky to all of a sudden

00:12:49.673 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
be seen and hearing all of
these other sounds and sights

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't normally hear
with my ears and my eyeballs

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that the biological drone
of that particular species

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:84%
has maybe, again, a
larger range of vision

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:84%
than the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
adapting to that but it

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
can be very interesting
to be hearing

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
higher and lower
register and seeing

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:84%
outside the visible
light spectrum.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I also heard that you have
to train with special weapons

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
for that body somatic type
that fits for that body.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I've even heard
sometimes they're

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:84%
somehow linked to the
body physically like

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
implanted into the body.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Usually, if you're
going in the form

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
of a different
biological body, you're

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
going to want to use a
weapon that would be seen

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:90%
in the hand of that creature.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.717 align:middle line:84%
So if you're on
another planet, you're

00:13:50.717 --> 00:13:52.550 align:middle line:84%
going to probably want
to have a weapon that

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is used in that planetary
system instead of having a tar

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and gun in an extraterrestrial
drone body that would make it

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
obvious that something's
not right here for a trained

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
eye in that culture where
you're going to want

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:90%
it to be the same thing.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
But because of some of the
hand-eye coordination issues,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
yeah, sometimes there's some
hard wiring implants and things

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that connect so
that you are getting

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
enhanced targeting, enhanced
shooting because even

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
with so many hours of
practice firing that weapon,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be the same
as the number of thousands

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
of hours that I have
practicing with a railgun

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.260 align:middle line:90%
or with a plasma gun.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to
translate quite the same.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be putting the
weapon into my hand, that's not

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
going to have the number
of hours of experience,

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and isn't going to have the
same accuracy that I do.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So putting in some enhanced
technological interface

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
to get higher accuracy
is totally a thing.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.345 align:middle line:84%
>> And who is utilizing
this type of technology?

00:14:56.345 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The most advanced military
units within covert military

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:90%
space program activities.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
This was not a technology
that I got anywhere near

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:84%
until I was in a
special forces unit

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
aboard the Farragut which is
a special forces operation

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
deployment vehicle that
has some of the most

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
advanced technology, some
of the most highly trained

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and experienced special
forces operatives

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to use in some really
interesting theaters of war.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was some of the most
advanced technology, tools,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:84%
weaponry that I'd ever
seen or ever used.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm presuming
from that that--

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and not getting to use this
in other stages of my career

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
as I was moving towards
that, it's just not something

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:90%
that everybody gets.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an isolated
technology that has only--

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
we only have so
much access to and

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
because of the specialization
of the use and application

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
of that technology,
it's not something

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.620 align:middle line:84%
that is used fleet-wide
or military branch wide.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:84%
It's very specific to certain
teams, certain vessels,

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:90%
certain special forces units.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> When mission command contacts
you with your orders, Randy,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.910 align:middle line:90%
do they--

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
like what determines if they're
going to send this 3D Randy

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to put him
in an avatar for this?

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Who makes that decision and why?

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.290 align:middle line:84%
What would be the deciding
factors for that mission?

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Tactical officers would be
the ones who would be making

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.110 align:middle line:84%
those decisions, and those
decisions are going to be based

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
on a kind of bean counting
over risk and reward,

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and what's the risk of sending
my personal body in a battle

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:84%
suit versus what's the
risk factor of sending

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:84%
a teleoperated drone
with me controlling it,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:90%
how far is the range.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
If the range is
too far, we're not

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to get close
enough that may eliminate

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of being able
to use a teleoperatable drone

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:84%
or require that we get
closer in order to be

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:90%
used to teleoperatable drone.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So gravity,
atmosphere, the species

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're assisting or
engaging with as an enemy,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
those are all factors
that are going to work in

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and some tactical
officer bean counter

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
is going to sit there with some
other guys checking off boxes,

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:90%
doing some math.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere down at
the end of the page,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
go, well, it looks

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
like it's the most effective,
efficient thing for us

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And then that's the
decision process.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's way out of my
decision making process.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I just get pulled--

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:84%
do this, get in that, do
that, kill that, rescue that,

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:90%
do that, thank you.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Why wouldn't they use
more AI robots and cyborgs?

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Why would they choose a
drone avatar over that?

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's because certain
technology continues to have

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:90%
hackable applications.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you use a robot or
an AI cyborg of some kind,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the minute that someone hacks
your AI robot or cyborg,

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:90%
they can turn it against you.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's way more
difficult to turn my brain

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
against the people that
I work for than it would

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.430 align:middle line:90%
be an AI or a cyborg unit.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it makes total sense.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So where do you see
the future in terms

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.645 align:middle line:90%
of like these avatar programs?

00:18:18.645 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well as far as covert
military space program

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:84%
activities are concerned, we're
going to continue to use them

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
wherever it's deemed that we
should use them or it's best

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:90%
to use them.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I think as far as
the technology,

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that's going to trickle down
into terrestrial branches.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be one
of the last things

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that we see trickle down
from the covert space program

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to the less than
covert space program

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:90%
and military activities.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think eventually,
we'll see it.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be one of the
last things that trickle down.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So in what situations would
these avatar bodies be utilized

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:90%
for?

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Who is using this ability
and making those decisions?

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like I said, tactical
officers end up making

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
the decision and the
circumstance is going to be

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
mostly determined by what
the hostility or threat level

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:84%
to using current technology,
battle suit technology,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
or our own biological
bodies is concerned.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking about a
situation where you're talking

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
anywhere from 0.5G's to 1.5G's,
and oxygen or mostly nitrogen

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
CO2, non-toxic non-acidic
non too basic sort of pH,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be likely where
it's going to be me in a battle

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:90%
suit.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:84%
If it's really hostile, gaseous,
breathable environments,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
highly acidic or highly basic,
or higher gravity than 1.5,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that increases the
chances that you're going

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:90%
to use a biological drone.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, there also may be
some question of stealth.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the minute that
I show up in a battle suit,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
you know that a Terran has
shown up in a battle suit.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
If I'm teleoperating
a biological drone,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
you may have some
cloak of no one

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
being able to tell that you're
anything other than whatever

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that biological
species is before you

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
do something like shoot
someone or blow something up.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So there may be some
issues of stealth

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:84%
but it mostly has to do
with gaseous environments

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and gravity.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you get above
gravity, above 1.5G,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and you get into toxic
environments where the acid

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
or the basic pH of the
gases is going to do harm

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to the technology, to the
parts and the moving parts

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of the suit, or start eating
through the suit itself,

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
then they start doing the
calculation of whether or not

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
it's worth it to
use an avatar drone.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In your experience, Randy,
have you ever seen them use

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:84%
this technology with
animals or mammals?

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's totally
possible to use a animal clone

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:90%
biological drone as well.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is some
of the early experiments

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:84%
were used on gorillas, big
cats, and even elephants.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And that soldiers
who were using them

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:84%
were teleoperating in big
cat bodies, gorilla bodies,

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
or elephant bodies because
they were terrestrial mammals

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
close enough of a link

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to figure out how to
connect the cerebral interface

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
into an elephant's brain
before we could figure out

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
how to connect that
cerebral interface

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.695 align:middle line:84%
into a biological drone
of another species.

00:21:46.695 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was way--

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:90%
baby steps.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It was baby steps to
use terrestrial animals

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.150 align:middle line:84%
in the early stages
of developing

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
the technology because
that was easier

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and you could get
more clear data

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that you would
need to then apply

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.715 align:middle line:84%
for the advanced technology into
another extraterrestrial body

00:22:06.715 --> 00:22:07.515 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they using this
technology here in the civilian

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:90%
world on planet Earth?

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Not as such we as Terrans
in the space program are not

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:84%
supposed to use it on other
Terrans or here on planet

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:84%
However, this is technology
we got from extraterrestrials

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
who first brought it to us by
coming here and teleoperating

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
human biological drones so that
they didn't have to interact

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
with our environment
biologically, the atmosphere,

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and the gravity, and so forth.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So from the same
exact way that we

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.510 align:middle line:84%
use this technology with
other biological drones

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and other beings
on other planets,

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
other species have
been doing that here

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:84%
with Terran biological
drones for millennia.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there an example you
can give us on that and maybe

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.055 align:middle line:90%
an agenda to follow up with?

00:22:58.055 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure if I could give
a specific example other than

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.188 align:middle line:84%
that we know for some, again,
probably thousands of years,

00:23:06.188 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
this is a technology that
they've used so that they can

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
interact as seamlessly
as possible with us.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, the agenda is
to observe and report.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time when you
want to interact seamlessly,

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
it's so that you can
gather information,

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:84%
communicate, and
take that information

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
without walking down the street
as an obvious extraterrestrial

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
being that would get lots
of, oh my god, what is that?

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So instead of that happening,
they can walk down the street

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and you just think
that's another person.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that's
been happening for a while.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I have had people say to
me, oh, I ran into this guy

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:90%
one time.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:84%
His eyes were doing this thing
and he was behaving like this.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Could that have been an alien
teleoperating in a human body?

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, I've had to
say, yeah, could have been.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.442 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I couldn't say whether
that's a yes or a no based

00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
on the information
you're giving me

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.585 align:middle line:84%
but you've given me information
that could be, yeah.

00:24:06.585 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any secrets or
classified information you

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:84%
could tell the audience and
myself how to pick one of these

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:90%
out if they were?

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
is that the giveaway

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.340 align:middle line:84%
is going to be in the
eyes because they just

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:90%
look differently.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
As a trained observer,
there are things

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that I would know to
look for and that I

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:84%
would know to recognize
that I'm not sure

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
how to describe, other than
to say that they are qualities

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
that you might not normally
recognize when you're looking

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
at people's eyes because
you look at people's eyes

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're like
that all the time.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And that if you saw something
that was out of character

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
for that, you might
not recognize it

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
as something that's
out of character

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and you may write it
off as like guys just

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.200 align:middle line:84%
got weird eyes or maybe
he's got an eye infection

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.525 align:middle line:84%
or maybe he's blind in
that one eye or who knows.

00:25:02.525 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain things
that, as a trained observer,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I would look for that
have to do with what's

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:90%
happening with the eyes.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is
clothing and behavior.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting to see a
species dress and act in a way

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:84%
that they think is the way that
a Terran dresses and behaves

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
but isn't necessarily the way
in which we dress and behave.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not to say that
every single person who's

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
dressed weird and behaves
weird is an alien.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
As a professional observer,
those are the characteristics

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that I would be looking for
if I was trying to spot one.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I also noticed with these
beings a very slight delay

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
in facial movements,
eye movements,

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:90%
and even answering questions.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Just slightly.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the buffer in the
cerebral interface, yeah.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:84%
There can be just a half a
second to a second sometimes,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:84%
so like a delay in a
satellite camera delay.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:84%
If you were saying
something to me

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm actually
teleoperating from--

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's hard to pick up.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> --10,000 miles up, there
could be just a slight delay

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
in the transmission
that could cause, again,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that just slight delay in
talking or facial movement.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Something might move
quickly to my right

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and it might take me just
to half a second before I

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:84%
track that, depending on
how smooth the technology

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:90%
in the buffer is.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if a avatar could
biologically fly an organic

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
craft that's made
from the same DNA.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> In theory, yeah.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean It would make sense.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there were certain
extraterrestrial craft that can

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
only be flown by a pilot that
matches the biological pattern

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that can sit-in
the pilot's seat.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're teleoperating
a drone, then yeah,

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
you can sit-in the pilot's
seat and fly that craft

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.650 align:middle line:84%
because then you're
matching the genetic profile

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:90%
that the ship requires.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible for an
extraterrestrial to be

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:84%
kidnapped, taken
to a laboratory,

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and then outfitted with
this cerebral circuitry,

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and then a handler like
yourself take over that body?

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It's feasible.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say that that's within
the brackets of possibility

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
which always comes into the
interesting ethical and moral

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
questions of whether you
should do something like that,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
or if you did, whether
you're crossing

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
a certain ethical or
moral boundary line.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because this is
not a grown clone now.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
taking someone,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:84%
you racing them,
attaching the unit,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:90%
and then taking over that.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, which is why I said
that represents definitely

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
a more ethical, moral
quandary problem.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But as we know, that isn't
necessarily something

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
that stops people from
applying certain technologies.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So again, saying that
that's within the brackets

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of possibility, I would
go probably also as far

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
to say that that's been done.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Fingers crossed,
let's hope that's not

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
done very often from an
ethical and moral perspective,

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
but it could be done,
probably has been done,

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and unless there were
stronger oversights and laws

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
against such things, could be
applied that way by anyone who

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:90%
had access to the technology.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Randy, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:38.255 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:28:38.255 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for having me.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.315 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
pleasure to be here.

00:28:41.315 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
