00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:84%
we have a very special guest,
Sergeant Clifford Stone,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
ex-military operative
who had much experience

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials,
especially with telepathy.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.658 align:middle line:84%
Sargent Stone,
welcome to the show.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.033 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD STONE:
Thank you, sir.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
It's my great
privilege to be here.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was your first
experience with telepathy

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.857 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials?

00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, I
really didn't realize

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that it was the
case when I saw all

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:90%
the beings as little children.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it didn't
dawn on me that they

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
were talking to me in
telepathy or thought transfer.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But as other people
couldn't see them,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.912 align:middle line:84%
other people couldn't
hear them neither.

00:01:01.912 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had to choose my
time, which they already

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
knew what I was saying because
the thought transfer, when

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking it,
went to them also.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'd wait till I
was in a safe place

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.845 align:middle line:84%
where no one's around
to talk to them.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, they already knew
because I had already

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
talked to them the same way
they were talking to me.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first
experience with it.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what was
going on at the time.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was
that like, though?

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to
transmit your thoughts?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Or it was just natural?

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It was a natural
occurring process.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And they actually, later on--

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
well, Korona actually
later on told me

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that many of your scientists
are well aware of the fact

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that all of you have
the ability to do this.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you weren't
trained or you don't really--

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
if you think you can't do
something, you can't do it.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is to get
the right mental process,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
get in the right
mental condition

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and telling yourself you can do
it and practice makes perfect.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was your
first setting like?

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So explain it in detail
with the ET or ETs

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that you were having this--
you said children ETs.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I had--
at the age of four,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
they started the grooming of
me to getting me ready to where

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%
if they chose me, I'd be ready.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, I saw these--

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and all I can call
them is shadow people.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
They were like
shadows in my bedroom.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And that made it difficult. I
wanted to sleep with the lights

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.003 align:middle line:84%
Well, I couldn't
sleep with lights on.

00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So I had to endure with
the shadow people there.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear whispers,
but I couldn't make out

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
what was really said.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
This is where,
actually, like you're

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
trying to tune into
a station, but I

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't realize it at the time.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:84%
When I got a little
older, then I

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
started to run in to children
that no one else could see,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:90%
that only I could see.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It didn't dawn on me that with
these children speaking to me,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
it's like you and I
talking right now.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it was.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But yet, no one else
could hear them.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.383 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were the messages
they were transmitting to you?

00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They were talking
to me just like you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.717 align:middle line:84%
and I. They wasn't
telling me they

00:03:24.717 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
were from some other planet
or anything like that.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It was just common
communication.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't question as
to where they were from.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:90%
To me, they were children.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But they went
ahead, they would--

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'd think, OK, when I
get to a safe haven area

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
where no one's around, I
can go ahead and ask them

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
some quest-- well, they already
knew what I was thinking.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And you took this as
an educational moment to learn.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
You said they were
grooming you for something

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that you already, maybe,
had an inclination was

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
going to be really important
for your future, it sounds.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.813 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Well, yeah.

00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was taking it from
the get-go as a learning

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be until I
found out who Korona was

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and what he really
looked like that I had

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:90%
to make that tough decision.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Resist it and probably go crazy
or accept it and learn from it.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How fast did
it progress for you

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that you knew you
had this ability

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and that they were willing
to reach out to you?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, seeing
them as just children,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:84%
that went on for maybe
about three, four months.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And no real problems.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I even got to the point
where I started enjoying it.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:10%
But then when I had
the incident where

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:10%
I found that little
bird that was injured

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:10%
and I accidentally killed
it and I saw Korona

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:10%
as he really looked, that's when
it took on a whole new reality.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:10%


00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:10%
That's actually when I
really realized at that time

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:10%
that he's not talking
to me the way we talk.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And even though I
still felt that I

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:84%
needed to articulate
what I was thinking,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.798 align:middle line:84%
he already knew
what I was saying.

00:05:13.798 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Then he was trying to
point out to me later

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
on about the situation
that we don't

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:90%
have to talk to one another.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is formulate
the thoughts with our mind,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and we can transfer.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And he even called
it thought transfer.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Thought transfer.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: And here it was.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
He was making it clear
that that's what it was.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is actually--

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
with thought transfer, it's the
most honest and purest means

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
You may not be telling
something factual,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
but when that thought
transfer is going through,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
it's what you truly
believe to be the truth.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think no one's
ever pointed that out.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I always say there's
no misinterpretation when

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
you have telepathy because
it's emotion, it's talking,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:90%
it's a visual.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You have 10 times
more communication,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
things happening than me
just talking or texting you,

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
which is I think is a
horrible way to communicate.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because there's
always a misinterpretation.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: A whole lot of
things get misinterpreted

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:90%
through transmission.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And with thought
transfer, there's

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
not a chance of
misinterpretation.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there some
extraterrestrial species

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
that you really had to be
careful with because they're

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
more sensitive to the language
and maybe not used to humans?

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Most ETs that I've dealt
with are very compassionate

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and they know that we're
learning telepathy.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
However, I've heard that there
are other extraterrestrials

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:84%
out there that have not had
experience working with us

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and they find us
a little repulsive

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
with language communication
and the way we look and smell.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, I think your
latter comment is probably

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:90%
very true.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the actual
process of thought transfer,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:90%
it is universal.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:90%
No new technique involved in it.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But how you perceive
that information

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:84%
may have an impact on the person
that is actually receiving it.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
You may mean
something really good,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:90%
but in their way of thinking--

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:84%
not through the thought
transfer process,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
but in the way of the
thinking of maybe a newcomer

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to the intergalactic community,
he may not really fully grasp

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:90%
what you're trying to say.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.482 align:middle line:90%
And that can cause--

00:07:58.482 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: An
interpretation problem.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.303 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes, absolutely.

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever
experienced an interpretation

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:90%
problem with an ET?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Me, personally,
I never had that problem.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But here, again, in
all the communications

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and all the interaction
with our visitors,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I learned one thing,
that there must

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
be that sense of humbling
oneself on both sides.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, even
within our own societies,

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:37.639 align:middle line:84%
ego can go ahead and cause a
lot of problems among even two

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:38.439 align:middle line:90%
friends.

00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I hate people to
display their ego.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
situation is ego will

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
cause a whole lot of
problems, and it's

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:90%
the same with our visitors.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think
that through some way,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
they're either
reading I have an ego

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
or I'm reflecting ego in some
way, form, or fashion, which

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:90%
is not the case at all.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can ETs, during
this thought transmission,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
access your mind and also know
a lot more about you than you

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:90%
actually wanted to tell anyone?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: You can't
keep secrets from them.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they can definitely
pick up on the--

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.815 align:middle line:84%
they can pick up on
the inner real you.

00:09:29.815 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:84%
They're going
through the process

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of deciding who they're going
to follow throughout life.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly
what they're doing.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does thought
transfer have a limitation due

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:90%
to proximity and distance?

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Once again, this
is simply my opinion,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:84%
but I would say it
has no limitation.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I agree.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And a lot
of times, we are

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
subject to that and not even
know that we are subject to it.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
A good example, you
have a loved one that's

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
somewhere overseas
and something horrific

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:90%
may be happening to them.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, their
thoughts turn to you,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
you pick up on those thoughts.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And your thousands
of miles away.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.738 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.738 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:84%
I've had experiences
with that, and I

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
know other people
have had experiences.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends got
killed in Vietnam.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I was begging him not to die.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
When I got back to
go meet his family

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and tell them what he
wanted me to tell them,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:90%
the wife already knew.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:84%
She picked up on it,
and she was telling me

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:84%
the things that was
happening at that night

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that she had no way of
knowing, no way at all to know.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was him
reaching out to her.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when we
lose a loved one that's

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
great distances away
from us, we sometimes

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
feel them coming within
our presence and sense

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
the fact that they're
coming there to tell us

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
goodbye for a while, that we'll
meet later on in another plane.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Forgive me for getting
emotional about that.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's fine.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:84%
In your experience, have
you felt with telepathy

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that some are a little bit more
overbearing and stronger energy

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:90%
with emotion than others?

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.985 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I think that there
are situations where--

00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and I really don't know
how to interpret that.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
there are situations--

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
if what you're asking,
can they actually

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and use
that mental power

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate you to do things
that you normally wouldn't do,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:90%
and I would say yes to that.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Now once again, when
I say yes to that,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that's not necessarily
to mean to have you do

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:90%
the wrong things, for example.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
People were putting themselves
in danger, they go ahead--

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're just thinking, well,
gee, if I've turn this corner,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting myself
in harm's way.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
That's just things
you're thinking about,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and you may still
turn that corner.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
They could actually
go ahead and give you

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.900 align:middle line:84%
such a strong sense of thought
on turning into that corner,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:84%
you'll go on down a
block or two then go.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And you won't understand
why you did that.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, they had the
ability to do that.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they had the ability
to manipulate your choices?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing
they can't do, make

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
you do something that
you feel is immoral

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:90%
or something that is wrong.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So if I'm
a serial killer

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.012 align:middle line:84%
and I think killing is fine,
then they'll let me kill?

00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: No, they're not
going to let you kill.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: But that's--

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.292 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: The situation
is they're not

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:90%
going to interfere with that.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's among us here.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:22.720 align:middle line:84%
If you are a serial killer,
then you have a mental blockage.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.527 align:middle line:84%
And they aren't here
to cure us, per se.

00:13:29.527 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why are they here then?

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And why are they allowing
telepathy to happen?

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Are they trying to teach us?

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They're
trying to teach us,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
but not everyone's
being selected

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:84%
for them to have the interfacing
lift to follow throughout life.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Only those people and,
from time to time,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
the average man off the street
on a one-time basis or a couple

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:84%
times because they're
trying to learn something

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%
from that particular individual.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:90%
People have experiences.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
You have the people who are
selected to which they're

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.100 align:middle line:90%
going to fall throughout life.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:84%
You have others,
for whatever reason,

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
they have that one-time
encounter or that situation

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
where they may have several
times encounter, where

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
our visitors are
trying to figure out

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
something about that
individual or individuals.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll come back
several times over

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
to just check where
the process stands now.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like they're
trying to control

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
the entire population of
planet Earth and mandate

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:90%
through thought control.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
We are responsible for
our actions, even those

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%
who are mentally ill among us.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Short of physical intervention,
there's nothing they can do.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Like with the serial
killer, that right there

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.295 align:middle line:84%
has to do with certain
blockages of the mental process.

00:15:05.295 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were you
ever in any type

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:90%
of special training for this?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.323 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I fought
not to go to it.

00:15:11.323 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Therefore I didn't go.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it because
of programming?

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, to me, I felt
that if I went to the training

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
that they were
giving, that it would

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:90%
be a sense of being programmed.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The army had the initial
onset of remote viewing,

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
which is mind transfer
within its own right.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
That project at the time is
known as Project Center Lane.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Later, the DIA took it over
and it became part of MKUltra.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
But I saw people who
went there who came back,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and they had very high egos
and they put other people

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
at a lower level than they were.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:90%
I had problems with that.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So at every turn of the
corner, when they said--

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and the way they put it, we
won't send you to school.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I fought like crazy not to go.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
give you an option?

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: No, it
wasn't an option.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It was, we want you
to go to this school.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it came to
this particular aspect--

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and if you go to any
organization that

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
was working with remote viewing,
they would find the people,

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
they'd select them,
and that was an option.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't something they would
automatically force on you.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.162 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that, they were

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
very concerned
about what was going

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
to happen when Congress and
the media picked up on the fact

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:90%
that they were doing this.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:47.220 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, when they
found out about MKUltra,

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:84%
the CIA destroyed
tens of thousands

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
of government documents dealing
with that just so Congress

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't find out about it.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:90%
So that was my out on that.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And I made it quite
clear that I wasn't

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.079 align:middle line:84%
real crazy about how I saw
people act when they came back.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:84%
Also, if the government
had their way,

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
you would have been
right with that unit

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:90%
throughout your entire career.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is that's
not good for promotion

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and moving up the ladder of
your profession and career.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:90%
We got to the point where--

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
even though we said it wasn't
the case, we got to the point

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:84%
where we were about 87% accuracy
within our remote viewing

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Also, the remote viewing
program came into play

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
because the DIA, once
again, did reports

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
on what the Russians were
doing, the former Soviet states

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:90%
were doing.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
They considered that
an advanced technology.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And the former Soviet Union
was much further ahead of us

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.045 align:middle line:84%
in this new advanced
technology than we were.

00:18:02.045 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is that?

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Did they have an upper
hand because maybe they

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
were speaking to the
extraterrestrials

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%
before we were?

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I don't know
why they were ahead,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
but they took the
fact that thought

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
transfer was a potential
weapon of the future.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that you
have to keep in mind

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
is that they were working
on to make a weapon.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, you could go ahead
and with this thought transfer,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
they were working
on what they also

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.815 align:middle line:84%
referred to as out of
the body experience.

00:18:32.815 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Now they had to
acknowledge there

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:90%
was something really there.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there
any memorable entities

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that you can recall that
were your favorites when

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:90%
it comes to telepathy?

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, like I say,
my most favorite, once again,

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:90%
would be Korona.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
There was another one
that was very human-like,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and of course that was
the great philosopher.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:90%
I learned a lot from him.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.302 align:middle line:84%
And those would be the top
two that are most memorable.

00:19:03.302 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what did
you learn from him?

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.593 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Oh, there
were certain things

00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:90%
that I would like to know about.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And trying to put where I
remember one instance, that's

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
hard to do because
a lot of times it

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
was like talking
to a philosopher.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:90%
He taught me how--

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.700 align:middle line:84%
with war, people-- and
there is a reason for that.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:84%
I was having very bad
thoughts about things

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
I was seeing in war.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
He says, these
people aren't acting

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
the way they would normally
act, that they will actually,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in the end, regret the
actions that they're taking.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be in a
position where you can say,

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I forgive them.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
They're victims in another
realm, meaning a lot of them

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:84%
were killed, that
in their own time,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
they will forgive the person
that did these transactions

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:90%
against them.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But the whole
situation is they were

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to make me understand
it is the horror of war that

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
makes people do horrible things
that otherwise they'd never

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:90%
have done.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of
cases I was thinking,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:84%
this person has to be a bad
person from the beginning

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:90%
because of what they were doing.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:90%
And that wasn't the case.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way he was
trying to explain it to me.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the best
things I can remember.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.612 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do you make
a distinction of someone

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:90%
in the room that's not an ET?

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Or if they are an ET, how do
you know who's saying what?

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: By the
thought process itself.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
By the content of
the message itself.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Our visitors only talk
to you in various ways,

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they're even going
to get certain things mixed up

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
that you would never ever expect
a person that may be trying

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to do-- and we call it
thought manipulation--

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
that is very human that
knows how to do that.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Thought manipulation.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.070 align:middle line:84%
What kind of advice
can you give us

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:84%
when meeting an extraterrestrial
so we do the right thing?

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: If it's your first time
and you've never believed even

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
in their existence, you know
you've come upon something

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:90%
highly unusual, highly unknown.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Now for the first time, you
know there is an intelligence

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.160 align:middle line:90%
outside of humanity.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.715 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead, listen--

00:21:48.715 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it this way.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Listen with your
mind and your heart.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And understand that
they may go ahead

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and open up to you
with thought transfer.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:06.605 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going to hear it,
just like you and I talking.

00:22:06.605 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But people seeing this are
going to think, oh, this

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:90%
is all my imagination.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I think I hear
them talking to me.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Form something friendly
in your own mind

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to refer back through
thought transfer

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:84%
because they're going
to pick up on it.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
If they pick up only fear
and the sense that you

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
want to do something
to try to harm them,

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
respond in kind.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you go ahead
and think that I'm

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.438 align:middle line:84%
glad to make your
acquaintance, I

00:22:40.438 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
know you're not from
this Earth, this

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:84%
is my first experience,
bear with me,

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
if there is questions
you have of me

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that I might answer, I shall try
to answer, so feel free to ask.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to verbalize that.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:84%
You need to think
it in your mind,

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and they'll pick up on that.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
But all too often, the first
thoughts they pick up on

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is the fear and the results
of fear of doing harm

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:90%
to the energy they're seeing.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, do they
also have any rights here?

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: No.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
The wild life of this
planet have more rights

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:90%
than our visitors.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Our visitors are
not even recognized

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
by any government
shape, form, or fashion

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
as having any rights
on this planet at all.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
If you kill an insentient
being from another planet,

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
another dimension,
that isn't murder.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
The laws of this
planet apply only

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
to the living creatures
of this planet.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You go ahead and mistreat
a dog, you can go to jail.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
You go ahead and find a
way of capturing an ET

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and mistreat that ET in a
cruel and unusual manner,

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
you haven't broken a law because
the laws don't cover them

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
from this planet.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:90%
We need to go ahead--

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and even if the people
that are involved

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
don't believe in the
existence of these entities,

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:84%
understand that
someday we're going

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to make contact with
entities not of this world

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.748 align:middle line:84%
and make it clear that they
have certain rights also.

00:24:35.748 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why is it easier
for some people to say,

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
well, I can call out
to an extraterrestrial

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
or a civilization
and they show up,

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and some people will sit out
under the stars for a week

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:90%
and not see anything?

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I have no
real thought on that,

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:84%
other than that I do believe
some people have actually

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
had that type of
experience, whether it's

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:84%
brought on because of
their thought transfer

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:90%
or by circumstance.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll carry it one step further
by stating I firmly do not

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:90%
believe things just happen.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Things happen for a purpose,
whether we know that there

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:90%
was a purpose or not.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Within the universe, everything
has a meaning, a time

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and a place to fall in place.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.085 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is an accident.

Stone, thank you

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:90%

called Project Blue Book?
