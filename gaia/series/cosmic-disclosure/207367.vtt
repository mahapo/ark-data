00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:10%
we are with Tim, a tactical
advisor from Germany,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
and contact with Earth.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Richard Doty,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:10%
a retired
counterintelligence agent

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.963 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, we know
about the Roswell crash

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and the Corona and San
Antonio crashes in the 1940s.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And Tim, I know you
have some information

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:90%
you'd like to share about that.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, Corona and Roswell
and all the other things

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
that happened in North America
are pretty much way back

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:90%
in history, to me at least.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't too important.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But I had-- I was in contact
with two species that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
might or might not have been
influences on this scenario

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:90%
and what happened in New Mexico.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm super interested
to learn from Richard

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
what he knows from documents
and also his own experience.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:84%
So my theory is that we are--
because so many people have

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
seen something, and there are
documents all over the place,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:90%
and people are--

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I think they are describing
two Grey beings, which

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:84%
are essentially different
from each other,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
but they both had
some kind of incident,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even some
relation to that.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's my theory.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And Rick,
we kind of do know

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
there's multiple sites,
like seven of them at least,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
of these crash sites.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
should also go over

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
the different types
of extraterrestrials

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and these different sites.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people see
Roswell as just one crash site,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
one species of
beings and that's it.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:90%
What could you share with us?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, in 1979 I was
briefed into the program,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Project Aquarius, where I
learned of the Roswell crash

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
site, the Corona crash site,
the Horse Mesa crash site,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the Kingman crash site, the
possible San Antonio crash

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:90%
site, the--

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and some in Nevada.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.835 align:middle line:84%
But in Roswell,
and what happened,

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and what I read in documents,
and what I actually

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
saw in a recovery film,
a United States Army

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
film that was taken
at the time period,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
was that there were two
Eben crafts flying over New

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Mexico in July of 1947.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
They were on a
reconnaissance mission.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But it was during
an electrical storm.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And because of this
electrical storm,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
it was a very violent
electrical storm--

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:84%
now, you've got to understand
that even though these two Eben

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
crafts are flying
in our atmosphere,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're highly
advanced in the technology,

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
they weren't accustomed
to lightning.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
lightning on their planet.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was it
disrupted some instruments,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.525 align:middle line:84%
and the two craft collided in
midair, one landing near Corona

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico with a debris
trail that went south.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other craft
landed miles away,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
west of Socorro, New
Mexico in Horse Mesa.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How large
were these craft?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: These crafts were
30, 35 feet in diameter.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The first crash site near Corona
was found almost immediately.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It was found maybe
a day or two later

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:90%
by an archaeological team.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
The debris trail, which
was the antenna that

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
connected to the Corona
craft, crashed in a ranch.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:10%
Jesse Marcel and that group
was responsible for recovering

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:10%
the debris trail.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.818 align:middle line:84%
Now, the debris trail
and the actual craft

00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:90%
They were some miles away.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
The archaeological team found
the crash site, immediately

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%
notified the local Sheriff.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:84%
A Sheriff and state police
responded to that scene,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
along-- and they immediately
notified the army

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:84%
at Kirtland Field
in Albuquerque.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
One live ET was found--
that was EBE 1--

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and there was five dead ETs.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
The crash site west of here,
Horse Mesa, west of Socorro,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:90%
wasn't found for two years.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
It crashed in a very remote
area of New Mexico not used

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:90%
for anything.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
In 1949, a rancher
was moving his cattle

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:84%
from a lower pasture
to a higher pasture

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and discovered the crash site.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
All the ETs were
dead and highly--

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
their bodies were decayed.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
That crash site was reported
to the Catron County Sheriff's

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Department.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
distance involved,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
it took him several
days to get there.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he had to drive
back to notify the authorities.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
At that time, in
1949, the Air Force

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
existed, Kirtland
Air Force Base.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So the Air Force responded from,
again, Albuquerque and also

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:90%
from Los Alamos.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, we had
a live ET at Los Alamos.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
They went down, recovered that
crash, excavated that site.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What species
did they claim it?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They were both Ebens.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:90%
There was the same exact craft.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The technology was
exactly the same.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, jump ahead to the San
Antonio craft crash site.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of conjecture
in the San Antonio site.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people said it was a
military plane that crashed.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:10%
There's been a book written,
"Trinity," very well-written

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:10%
book about that it was a ET.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
There were some kids that had
actually responded and saw it.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:90%
There were bodies there.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:90%
There was a recovery.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:90%
That recovery went to Roswell--

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Walker Air Force
Base at the time.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, there was also a craft--

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:90%
a crash in Kingman, Arizona.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that craft was entirely
different than the one

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
that crashed and recovered at
both Corona and Horse Mesa--

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:84%
different also from the one that
crashed at San Antonio or south

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:90%
of San Antonio.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So now we got at least
three separate ET races

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that we recovered, and again,
three distinct technologies.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
The Corona was different
than the San Antonio, which

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:90%
was different than the Kingman.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.077 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did the
Kingman craft look like?

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The Kingman craft
was more oval-shaped.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It was very thick because the
bodies found at the Kingman

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:90%
craft were taller.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't exactly
know the dimensions,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.022 align:middle line:84%
but they were over five
feet, larger than the Ebens

00:07:07.022 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that were found in
the other craft.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Maybe these
are Greys, or--

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They could
possibly be Greys.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I would be interested
to hear what Tim

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:90%
would have to say about that.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
some other crashes

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in Nevada
and one in Colorado.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The two in Nevada, which I'll
talk about a little bit later--

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
well, I'll go into
great details on that.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
But I'm interested to hear what
Tim would say about the three

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:90%
distinct ET races.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interesting.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go into a lot
of files and documents

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
about Roswell and
the other crash sites

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
because it was kind of in
the beginning of everything.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, because of
where I'm coming from,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
these are things that happened
in North America might not

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:90%
be that interesting.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But here's my take
on that, as someone

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
who has done research
on at least two species,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Greyish species.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people or
read some people that

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
have different descriptions
on different beings,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:90%
different Grey beings.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the number of
fingers is different.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they describe
them differently.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So my theory is-- and I know
that two Greyish species,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking the Ebens and
what I would refer to as Greys,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
they were at war at
that particular time.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
They had a conflict that
took like, I don't know,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:90%
5,000 or more years.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they, in
some way or another,

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
they do inhabit the same
star system of Orion.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be connected
through some kind

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of evolutionary path,
which means the Ebens

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and the Greys are some
relatives to each other.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys have
this, you could

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
say, mindset that they want to
remove every trace of genetics

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:84%
from the past, and only keep
one successful main master

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:90%
line of genetics.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And that has resulted in a
terrible, terrible conflict.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
While the Ebens, as a
biological entity or species,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
wanted to survive,
wanted to have

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:90%
their own right in evolution.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys saying, no,
we have one master line

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be more
stable than yours.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:90%
So they got into conflict.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And at that time--

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and the conflict,
to my knowledge,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
ended very recently, like
two, three, four years ago.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they
were in conflict.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have this
theory that the Ebens

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
were some kind of explorer,
explorative species,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
doing a non-invasive
observation mission on Earth.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And something brought them down.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
We all know this is a
terrible thunder or something.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys have this
technology in order

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to use weather
phenomena as a weapon.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:90%
So even if they were--

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
addressed that, and they were
kind of secretive to that,

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I think because the conflict
ended, maybe that's the reason.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But I could think
that or imagine

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that they used this technology
in order to bring down

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
some of the ships
from the Ebens,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because they knew
that this would

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
have a massive impact on the
current timeline of humanity,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and even get around some
kind of non-invasive

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
regulations, getting not
too much into contact

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
with humanity, and shooting
down different species,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:84%
which they were
at war at anyway.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So that this kind of
timeline and the importance

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:90%
of that kind of kicked in.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Tim, we have
all these beings traveling

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
light years to
Earth, and they're

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.635 align:middle line:90%
getting taken out by lightning.

00:11:48.635 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're so advanced.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That is the exact
question that came into my mind

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:90%
as well, Emery.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I think-- from what
we know is that the Ebens,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
they observed this planet
for thousands of years.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And they also have the
technology to overcome gravity

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:90%
and to travel into space.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Why would they be affected by
a lightning storm that much?

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:90%
And I have no answer to that.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious to know
what Richard knows.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I can only say that those
two species were at war.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And I think it would be super--

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
like super beneficial
for the Greys

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
to introduce or to force some
kind of contact from the Ebens

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.787 align:middle line:90%
That's my take on it.

00:12:42.787 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, what do
you think about that?

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.912 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Well, one of the
things we did at the Institute

00:12:46.912 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:10%
for Advanced Studies was--

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Puthoff at that institute
was in theoretical physics.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.470 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
questions was posed

00:12:53.470 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:10%
to them was exactly how can
a species travel thousands

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:10%
of light years or
hundreds of light years

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:10%
to our atmosphere
at Earth and crash

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:10%
because of lightning or some
other weather phenomena?

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Puthoff wrote
a whole paper about it,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:84%
how our weather, our physics
can affect a craft coming

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
from another place.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing you've
got to understand

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:90%
is we don't understand--

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.003 align:middle line:84%
especially at that time,
we don't understand

00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:90%
what their physics is.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand what their
material that their craft

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
was made of, how it's
affected by our environment,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
by our weather, by our
atmosphere, or by our soil.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
when these two crafts are

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
over New Mexico during a
violent thunderstorm-- now,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:84%
everyone knows, if you studied
anything about New Mexico

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:84%
weather, and having lived
there for a number of years,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I know the lightning
storms are atrocious.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They are.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They can be the worst
of any state or any place.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And this was one of the
worst in July of 1947.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And these crafts
just happened to be--

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
as Hal would have put
it-- in the wrong place

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:90%
at the wrong time.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were both struck,
and their instrumentations

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:90%
were basically fried.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
able to navigate--

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying this
in layman's terms--

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
navigate properly
and they collided.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's force fields
within their crafts.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
There's anti-matter pods
and all sorts of things

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't understand.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But they went haywire, and
that's how those two collided.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we've spoken about
these crashes in the '40s.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And they could have
came out back then

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
to the public and
allowed everyone

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to know, hey, this
is what's going on.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
a great opportunity.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But now it's still
kind of in a secret.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But it is leading into the
future of the media coming out

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and the military
and the governments.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
So why is that?

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think the importance of
Roswell and Corona, New Mexico

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and several other sites
and incidents is huge.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I think also that in
terms of communicating

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
with different
species, that they also

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge that the importance
of Roswell and Corona is huge.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
What I think is
that in the 1940s,

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
people, especially
the military, were not

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:middle line:90%
prepared for what happened.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
They were in midst
of a global Cold War,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
coming from a World War,
having the situation

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that some of the Nazis
did escape, which

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:90%
was enough to talk about that.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But then appearing-- having
a UFO appear somewhere

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico brings a
whole new level to that.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of decisions that

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
have been taken at that time
pretty much were fear-based,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and also some kind
of misunderstanding

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
what manhood needs to do and
how to stand up for that.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think now, with all
the information that people

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
have collected over decades,
we're now at the point

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
where people are understanding
everything pretty good.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
What we now right
at the moment see

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
with all the events
that took place--

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
the Nimitz, Tic
Tacs, and stuff--

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that we'll see a
revisiting of that incident

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
while behaving the
way people should

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:90%
have behaved in the '40s.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:90%
They acknowledge that.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
They bring that into
mainstream media.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:90%
They build like a expert group.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
They bring it to Pentagon, and
they spread the information

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledge that
we're still learning.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Rick, what do you
think in intelligence?

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:90%
You hear about disinformation.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You know how the
government works.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So where do you think this
was leading with Roswell up

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
until now, today, with
all the excitement

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:90%
of these new craft being seen?

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, in 1947, or
even going back to '45, '45,

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
the war was just ending,
towards the end of the war.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
'47, we were in the
beginning of the Cold War.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
There was certainly a lot of
counterintelligence experts

00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:90%
out there still.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had
counterintelligence--

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go
back to World War

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I we had counterintelligence.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So we've always had
counterintelligence,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
or what the public would
look at is disinformation.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we ran a number
of great operations

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:90%
during World War I and II.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, here it is in 1947,
a craft crashes in Roswell.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
The military doesn't know where
it came from, doesn't really

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
understand how this
craft could have

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:90%
came from some other planet.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of conjectures
going on within the Pentagon,

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
or within military-- it
wasn't the Pentagon then,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
a War Department-- about
was it the Russians?

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.578 align:middle line:84%
Was it-- could it
be the Chinese?

00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Where did this come from?

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be a
revitalized Nazi element?

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we knew the Nazis left.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
where they went to.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Some went to Brazil
and so forth.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So the military was
confused back then.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good
example of this.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Corso and some other people,
who, of course, passed away,

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
talked about this, talked about
why didn't the United States

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:84%
government just come
forth and say, listen,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:90%
we just had a crash at Roswell.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:90%
We recovered an ET.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We recovered one of
these UFOs that Arnold

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
had spotted over the
Cascades in Washington.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't we just
come out and say this?

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, we did.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:90%
We tried to.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody within the
government, the War Department,

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:84%
saw that paper, that
newspaper article and said,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
we can't do this because we
don't know where they came from

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:90%
or what they are.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have to keep
this a secret.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And we, then, the government,
the War Department,

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:84%
started a really aggressive
counterintelligence campaign

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:84%
or disinformation
campaign to come out

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:84%
with this weather balloon story,
which not many people realized

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:84%
it, because every single
one of the weather balloons

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.230 align:middle line:90%
were already accounted for.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any missing
weather balloons.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the fallacies
that the government

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.113 align:middle line:84%
forgot to cover up back
in that time period.

00:20:10.113 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were they also trying
to cover up the technology?

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And the technology.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people within
Los Alamos wanted--

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
listen, don't disclose
this craft to anybody.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
We want it because
the Soviets were in--

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were going to fight
a war, and a lot of people

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.498 align:middle line:90%
projected that.

00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle line:84%
We still were worried about the
Nazis, even a couple of years

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to guard,
protect this technology.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
We got this spacecraft, this
UFO from we don't know where,

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and now we're going to
take it to Los Alamos,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to go over
it with a fine-tooth comb

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.265 align:middle line:84%
and try to reverse
engineer this stuff.

00:20:48.265 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Little did we know
that we didn't

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:90%
understand their technology.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Even if we had a
live ET in captivity,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't explain it to us.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's the beginning of
this disinformation campaign

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
by the United States government
that has carried on to today.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
We've kept so many things
secret to the American public

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
or to the world over this
period of 70-some years.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
How can we possibly
come out now and tell

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:90%
the public everything we know?

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we can't
because of the technology.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:90%
We don't want the Soviets--

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
or Russians, excuse
me-- and the Chinese

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:84%
to know about them, although
they probably have their own.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
scare the public.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
What if we were to tell the
public we captured this ET.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:90%
His name is EBE 1.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And they have been visiting
Earth for 2,000 years.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
What's the first thing that
the public's going to think?

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:90%
Did they bring Jesus?

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, right.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: What
happened to religion?

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many things
that would play into this.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we jump ahead forward
to today, or some--

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
the 2004 incident, or later
on the Roosevelt incident.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Here we got this
something flying around

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in our atmosphere, defying our
technology, defying our radar.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:10%
Kevin Day said it
perfectly, that we had

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.480 align:middle line:10%
no idea what this thing was.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:10%
We couldn't track it like we
could track anything else.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:10%
He knew what the Russians had.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:10%
He knew what the Chinese had.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.690 align:middle line:10%
They had tracked Russian
aircraft and Chinese aircraft

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:10%
and North Korean aircraft.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.780 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they did.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:84%
They knew the technology
that were displayed.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But this thing, this Tic
Tac displayed technology

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that they had never seen before.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:90%
So now what do we do?

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, now they start this AATIP.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:10%
They try and investigate it.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:10%
And what's keeping them
from investigating?

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:10%
That's one entity,
one small entity

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:10%
within a conglomerate
of government

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:10%
that already knows the story.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
There's somebody up
here and somebody

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:90%
over here that knows the story.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But everything is
so compartmented

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that AATIP got a little bit
of information to run by,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
was closed to them.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.175 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could it
be disinformation?

00:23:13.175 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, it
could possibly--

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.662 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could it
be one of ours?

00:23:16.662 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: You know, there's
a lot of questions

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
about what happened
on the "Nimitz,"

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the alert
aircraft weren't armed.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why-- somebody--

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this guy talked-- he's
from Utah, he talks about this.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:90%
He was on the "Nimitz."

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the
fact that normally,

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
even when doing war games,
they got two alert aircraft

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that's armed with sidewinder
missiles, air-to-air missiles.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Always.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And they're always--

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, somebody
came on the ship a day

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
before and told them, don't put
any armed aircraft on alert.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Why would they do-- why
would anybody say that?

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.435 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Unless they're
protecting something.

00:23:53.435 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The fleet commander,
Admiral, I believe--

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I think they call it
the carrier commander

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.172 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it was in the Navy.

00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he questioned that,
but then he's just a one-star,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when this
is all happening,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:90%
those planes took off.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:90%
They're not armed.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
They can't shoot anything down.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:90%
That's my question right now.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked a lot
of people, and nobody

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:90%
seems to know the answer to it.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What a great
question and exposure.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'm pretty sure that
this is some kind of false flag

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the original
species that have developed

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
those Tic Tac UFOs,
which are the Greys,

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:84%
has made it pretty
clear that they do not

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:84%
access the air space of Earth
right now because there's

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
a global operation going on,
and they do not operate on Earth

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:90%
directly right now.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm-- also, the
questions you raised,

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:90%
which is super fascinating.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that the
military wasn't armed.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty interesting.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But also, the way
the Tic Tac behaved,

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that it came to the
aircraft carrier,

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
kind of provocative
manner and disappearing.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And then playing this
kind of cat and mouse game

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:90%
without doing anything else.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It just was some kind of,
I'm provoking the people

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:90%
on the ship.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:90%
So they follow this craft.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And then doing this kind of
game so it gets on the records.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure by
that, because that's--

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the original species, the Greys,
they have no reason to do that.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Why should they play
those cat/mouse games

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
with some conventional
military when they are already

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:90%
in contact with government?

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:90%
They know all that stuff.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:84%
That is why I believe
it's a false flag in order

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to bring out harmless,
but very profound

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
information to the public in
order to target the mainstream

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:84%
public of Earth people,
while there are other target

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:84%
groups, for example, the Gaia
audience who are well-informed,

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and they get different
set of information.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I really
agree with that.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Because number one,
the extraterrestrials,

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:84%
if they don't want to be seen,
they're not going to be seen.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.385 align:middle line:90%
Number two, there is a--

00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and I've been in a couple
of these meetings in DC

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:84%
where they are trying
to do a soft disclosure.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way to
show the public there

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
may be something
coming, even though we

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:90%
don't know what it is.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.740 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Rick?

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, what
came out later

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
was that there was a ship,
an unidentified ship.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It was a Navy ship, that pretty
sure was 10 to 12 miles away,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that the fleet ships didn't
have communications with.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's such a thing
as projection technology.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:90%
We have this.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
It's been tested in
Nevada Test Site.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
We actually saw it-- this
happen, out at Nellis Test

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Range, where we're
able to project things

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:90%
into the atmosphere.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We can fly these projections
in the atmosphere.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And it fools planes.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
distraction for the enemy.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If we were to go into combat, we
put 1,000 different projections

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
up in the air,
and an enemy plane

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.072 align:middle line:84%
coming in and seeing
all these planes,

00:27:38.072 --> 00:27:39.780 align:middle line:84%
they're going to turn
around and go away.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have-- it's called
projection technology,

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:90%
where we can project something.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, was this "Nimitz"
Tic Tac something

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that they were playing
against the "Nimitz" fleet?

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Were they-- I
mean, I don't know.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.485 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- that's the
question I'm asking.

00:27:55.485 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Were they projecting?

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
What was this ship doing
10 or 12 miles away

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.980 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have
contact with the fleet?

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:84%
It comes out-- this guy in
Utah, who was on the-- he said,

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:84%
we found this out the
next day there was just

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:90%
this ship out there.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.710 align:middle line:84%
They think it was one of these
intelligence-gathering ships,

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:84%
one of ours, that was
10, 12 miles away.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But what were they
doing out there

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
that we were trying
to communicate with,

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
communicating with us?

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Also, do you think
that the material they put out

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:84%
was kind of blurred
in post-production?

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing
I was wondering,

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not a military
guy so I don't know that.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you know that.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The video-- how can that be
state of the art video material

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that is on a US
aircraft carrier?

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Why is it black and
white and all blurry?

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, somebody--

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
if it was Kevin Day

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.620 align:middle line:84%
or whether it was
a pilot was trying

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:84%
to explain that when
they were capturing this,

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:84%
they were on a
different frequency,

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and they had to keep
changing something.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not technical.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a scientist, so
I don't remember what

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.240 align:middle line:90%
they were trying to change.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:90%
And he tried to--

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a pilot
that was trying to explain,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:84%
or it was the female
pilot was trying

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.420 align:middle line:90%
to explain why it was that way.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
the full explanation.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But there was an
explanation for that.

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I mean it looks totally
like a VHS from the '80s to me.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I've never been inside of any
military aircraft or something.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But I cannot imagine that
this is how it looks like.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Someone knows.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, there's skeptics
that said exact same thing,

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:84%
that they bring gun site
footage from the Gulf War,

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:90%
where it was clear as day--

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: 4K.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --in 19
what? '91? '90, '91.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 1990.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, and-- of these
F whatever planes they were

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and then comparing it.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a YouTube on
the internet about that,

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and comparing it to the one
in the "Nimitz" and saying,

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.180 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Did our technology in
15 years go downhill?

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Why is this so blurry
when this one isn't?

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, we've gone
from Roswell to Tic Tac.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
disclosure is going?

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So from my
experience with how

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:84%
governance and tactical
scenarios are set up,

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that the current
situation that we have

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:84%
has a significant fingerprint
or signature to it.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Also, things that
we have discussed

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
or people have discussed
like 10 years ago,

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
they show itself right now
everywhere in mainstream media

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:90%
and all over the planet.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty sure
that we are right now,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening now,
the disclosure topic

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.050 align:middle line:84%
as discussed right now
and brought to the public.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Not going too much into
detail what's happening,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:84%
but I would say that
there are different target

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:90%
groups on planet Earth.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Some people have been
profoundly been informed

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:90%
by experts on their fields.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that there is a
whole population, part

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
of the population, that
is very much affected

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:84%
by those disinformation
campaigns over years.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And they receive
different information,

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:90%
different levels of information.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think I want to make that
pretty clear to the audience,

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that when someone who's watching
this right now is really

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:84%
well-informed, knows what's
happening, maybe for years,

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and they are now getting in
contact with people who have

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
the first experience
with this topic,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.698 align:middle line:84%
people who were ridiculing that
topic like five years ago--

00:32:04.698 --> 00:32:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: A couple
of years ago, yeah.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.365 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Couple of years ago.

00:32:07.365 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
They are now saying, oh, yeah,
of course we're not alone

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
It's such an
enormous huge space.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there's something.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
They get different information
compared to people like Gaia,

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:90%
like the audience of Gaia.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
You also need to
keep in mind that we

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:90%
have a lack of personnel.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Because through this
enormous covert secrecy,

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.570 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of hard
to recruit people.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And besides, like many different
reasons for disclosure,

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.970 align:middle line:84%
one of them is to recruit
special new bodies,

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:84%
new personnel for
what's going to happen.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think those will
be recruited differently,

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.490 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
mainstream population that

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.372 align:middle line:84%
only gets the first
experience on that topic.

00:33:08.372 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, I have
a question for you.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been
debriefed recently

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:84%
about a disinformation
campaign of a soft exposure

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:84%
of doing a fake extraterrestrial
crash in either the Gulf

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of Mexico or the Atlantic, and
making it look like, oh, we now

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:90%
know this and this is real.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Is this something the
government would do?

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, where
do you think this is going?

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, I believe the
government would do that.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have had access of
actually one operation years

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.185 align:middle line:90%
ago that we actually did that.

00:33:45.185 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It was for a different reason,
but we staged a craft--

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.370 align:middle line:90%
a crash.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And we staged an abduction
and so forth, and with people

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:90%
who looked like ETs.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so the government
has done it in the past.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't put it
past them in the future.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems we
have with disclosure,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get Tim's
observation on this, is we,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.090 align:middle line:84%
as a nation, we're the
United States of America.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:90%
We're powerful.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:21.489 align:middle line:84%
But we know one aspect
of this phenomena.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
In order for disclosure,
I would think

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that we would have to have the
cooperation of every country

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
in the world that has had
contact with extraterrestrials,

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.280 align:middle line:84%
had captured an
extraterrestrial craft,

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and has had communications
with the extraterrestrials.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't do,
say, for instance,

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:84%
South Africa any good if
they came forth and said,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
you disclosure.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
do any good maybe

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.350 align:middle line:84%
for the South African
people, but it

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
has to be done
worldwide, and it has

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:84%
to be done not just
by the United States.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:84%
It has to be done
by every country.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And it would have to be
started and probably given

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:90%
at the United Nations.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I just wondered what
Tim thinks about that.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, to
my understanding,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that is exactly
what has happened,

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:19.900 align:middle line:84%
bringing all key players and
all nations together in secrecy.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But discussing that
topic of disclosure,

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.600 align:middle line:84%
how it's going to happen and
when it's going to happen--

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:90%
like for at least 10 years.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that the pressure,
the time pressure that is now

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
related to this
phenomenon, and there

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.520 align:middle line:84%
are different other
influences why there

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.700 align:middle line:84%
is time pressure on
that topic, is something

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that brought people into a more
confirmative way of thinking

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.950 align:middle line:90%
in order to bring that out.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And what we can see
right now is indeed,

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, a global operation
that is happening everywhere.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I know from discussions that
there are different components

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and different narratives
and different stories,

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:84%
scenarios, so to speak,
that can be put out.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
One of them could be, for
example, the efforts on Mars

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:84%
that Chinese, I think
Japanese, I don't know,

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
but also, of
course, perseverance

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.940 align:middle line:84%
from the United
States of America,

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that they have all their robots
and rovers on Mars right now.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
scenarios could be

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that something
passes the camera,

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.120 align:middle line:84%
or they find something in order
to bring ancient life on Mars

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:84%
into the discussion, which has
already occurred in Germany.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So there have been headlines
and also mainstream coverage.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It was totally normal to
speak about ancient life

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:90%
on Mars, which is--

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.790 align:middle line:84%
the way they put it out was
kind of surprising to me.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that is actually
a huge, huge release

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to speak publicly
about, yeah, we

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.440 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge there's
ancient life on Mars.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:90%
They've never done that before.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But the way they put it out,
or mainstream media coverage

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.830 align:middle line:84%
is putting that out, it's
like it's no big deal.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
It's something we acknowledged
a long time before.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.080 align:middle line:84%
There are different
other scenarios,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's either
misinformation or something

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that might be decided quite
spontaneously in order what

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.510 align:middle line:90%
is the situation right now.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And things could happen,
and we will definitely

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
see some more incidents
in the future.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But I think right now
we're at a stage where

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.970 align:middle line:84%
people who had contacts,
encounters, and knowledge

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.080 align:middle line:90%
are coming forward.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.575 align:middle line:84%
And we will see that in the
upcoming months, like a lot.

00:37:59.575 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot more people will come
forward and expose things.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And slowly by slowly, and
also very specifically,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:84%
target groups on
this planet, they

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
get prepared until we have a
homogenous kind of structure.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Tim, do you think we
have anything to worry about,

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:90%
as far as the ET phenomena?

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think we have
some unsolved patterns that

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.550 align:middle line:90%
show up on Earth.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And on this timeline,
the universe

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.750 align:middle line:84%
is projecting that
in a bigger scale

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
more experiences

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to those unsolved problems.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And through that, we're
going to decide things.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
that we're going

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to have a huge take
upon best practice

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:90%
examples in the universe.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And that will inspire
everything upon Earth

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about this
open scenario, open world,

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.110 align:middle line:90%
open system scenario.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm 70% optimistic
about everything.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, it will
eventually go right.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of new experiences

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to make, a lot of
interesting connections.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And the more open-hearted
we go outside in the world,

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe, at least, that the
more we can inspire and learn

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.150 align:middle line:90%

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.560 align:middle line:90%
