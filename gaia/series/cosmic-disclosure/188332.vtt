00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:18.993 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:21.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, we're here
with David Adair.

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:22.615 align:middle line:10%
Dave, thanks for
coming on the show.

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Glad to be here.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What an incredible subject we
get to talk about your mission.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And what you're into and what
you've been through already

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:90%
is very amazing.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.709 align:middle line:90%
What is your basic mission here?

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I thought it was
just like everybody else.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
You do a career,
you get to retire,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:90%
settle down with your wife.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
You just croak, and they put
you in the ground, that's it.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Apparently that's not
in the schedule for me.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I was five years old.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:90%
And there was an encounter.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't for me.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It was for somebody else.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But I just happened to
be in the right place,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:84%
right time, or wrong
place, wrong time.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But I came up on
this person when they

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:90%
were having their encounter.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only five,
so I'm really small.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So I-- looking out the
window, what's happening

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:90%
with the other person.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
I'll open the door here.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm so small, I have to crawl
up on the back of the couch,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.798 align:middle line:84%
put my foot on the door
latch and hold it down.

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And then I could open the door.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:90%
So I open the door.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, my head's up
at the top of the door.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I open the door
about four or five inches,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:84%
six inches, man, all I see is
this glowing green eyeball.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:90%
It's huge, and it's got--

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:90%
like a fly eye, it's got prisms.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was really
pretty, but freaked me out.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:90%
So I go to slam the door back.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
And when I slam the door back,
the door then blows open.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm hanging onto the
edge of the door.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So it throws me clear
across the room.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
bounce off the ceiling

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.035 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the room.

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm flying
through, I'm thinking,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:90%
boy, this is going to hurt.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So right before I
hit the ceiling,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.707 align:middle line:90%
this arm comes in so fast.

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:28.415 align:middle line:84%
You know how a tongue
on a lizard just --

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
[Pfsst]

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's that fast.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:90%
It's just lightning speed.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Catches me before
I hit the ceiling.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in its palm, and
it pulls me back to it,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
then steps back,
and then stands up.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's taller than the house.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at its face.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in its palm.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And I lean over to look at
its body, the side of it,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:90%
it's beautiful.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.693 align:middle line:90%
It's like burnt chrome.

00:02:57.693 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:90%
You ever seen chrome--

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.442 align:middle line:90%
>> --iridescent, really pretty.

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:01.295 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's-- looks like
a praying mantis.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It's four legs,
got these big round

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
flaps that's moving
as it's breathing.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
breath going out of it.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's looking at me.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's got the triangle
ahead, got some teeth

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:90%
like you wouldn't believe.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Looked like something
from "Predator."

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's this big--

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Were you frightened?

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, I'm
freaked out, you know?

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.702 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't think it
was going to kill me.

00:03:28.702 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I never was afraid
of it like that.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I was just more concerned
what's going on with the other--

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Other.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>> --incident that, what,
caused me to get in this mess.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And we, the bug and I,
we both look at them.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.698 align:middle line:90%
They look back at us.

00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And then we look at each other.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.552 align:middle line:90%
And then we look back again.

00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Look back, and he
looks at me and he just

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
goes with his other
hand, he puts in my face.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up in my bed
just screaming and crying.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And here's my mother and my
dad and my oldest brother

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and my other
brother at the foot.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling me
I'm having a bad dream.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But come to find out
later, it ain't no dream.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-mm.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So the question I had when I
started doing Pitholem and all

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:90%
this stuff, why me?

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out
that I kind of crashed

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
the party or an event
that was going on.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was the surprise
element, a wild card.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And I got tagged right then.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And they kept tracks on me.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And then when I became--

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.195 align:middle line:90%
from age 5 to 12--

00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that was different

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
about that immediate event
that night, when I was five,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
next day I am just some
kind of science nut.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Anything that have
to do with rockets,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
or space travel, or science, and
I mean every kind of science.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you notice this
right after the visitation?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right after.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And right after that, what
did you start doing then?

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.288 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing, going
to school was a cinch.

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Everything's rote memory.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Easy.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It was easy.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't even have to
think, just remember what it was

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
and write it down.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're so smart.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:90%
You're not thinking.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:90%
You're just memorizing.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately,
I didn't do that.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I went into the books.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Did well in school
without even trying,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:84%
but I'm working on the
real teaching, where

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning the harder,
more advanced stuff.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Once you go home and--

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.505 align:middle line:84%
Like, I used to
go home and be so,

00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
like, school was not
a big deal for me,

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:90%
because I was more self-taught.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.063 align:middle line:84%
I had to get more advanced
books to really get

00:05:36.063 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
into what I really
wanted to know.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I would do my homework on
the school bus going home.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:90%
By time I got home, I'm through.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And then that freed
me to do my real work,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.005 align:middle line:90%
where I pull out the--

00:05:47.005 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:90%
excuse me-- all of these books.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And these were not normal books
for a five-, six-year-old.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
It's quantum theory mechanics.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's celestial engineering.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:90%
It's titles of two feet long.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it all.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And then things
started happening.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it just science?

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Or did you--

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It was across the board.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Across the board,
lots of things.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything, history.

00:06:14.065 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Was easy, yes.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was just
anthropology, zoology,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
you name it, marine
biology, it was all of it.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Was like earth sciences,
you just take it all in.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And then opportunities
came that was not normal.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, when I was six years
old sitting in the library

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.378 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reading all these
big technical books.

00:06:33.378 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Librarian comes over
and looks at me.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
She goes, are you
reading them books?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just flippantly
look up and didn't

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:90%
mean to be smart about it.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But I said, well, there's
no pictures in them.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.357 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, huh.

00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So she says, how
much do you remember?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I said, all of them.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.628 align:middle line:90%
Everything in the book?

00:06:51.628 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything in every book.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So she just grabs a
book off the shelf,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and she asks me, what's
this book, I'm on page 36.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, it'll help
to have the title.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And she went, oh,
the singularities

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:90%
in quantum physics, page 36.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I go, in the event horizon
when the marketing difference

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.485 align:middle line:84%
between the colliding side at
the far end of the spectrum--

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And she just slams
the book shut.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.268 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, OK,
so you do remember.

00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
How many of these
books have you read

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:90%
in here, the science section?

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:90%
There's 600 books.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:90%
606, actually.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, you want to read more?

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you know, I'm
a six-year-old in Welch,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.632 align:middle line:90%
West Virginia, in 1950--

00:07:39.632 --> 00:07:40.432 align:middle line:90%
1960.

00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, not much is going
to happen here for me.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Have your mom bring
you back at 7 o'clock.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And that old woman turned
me into a librarian.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:90%
She made me a librarian.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I could order books forever,
as many as I could stand.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I went through a thousand
books in probably two years.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And that was so cool.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was Mrs. Hunt.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And she had no idea what she
unleashed on the world in just

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:90%
a mind-hungry being that I was.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But it kept evolving,
layering and layering on.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I'd
had enough foundation

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I could start extrapolating
my own theories of which

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:90%
way to go.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the math, I took
every math imaginable.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And the math started
coming easy, easy, easier.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And the more harder it
got, actually, the easier

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:90%
it got, if that makes sense.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to
start projecting

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:90%
where I want to go next.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And then I started--

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can read all
about swimming all day long,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
but until you get in the
water, you can't swim.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:90%
So I started building rockets.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And rockets are just
tools, but they quickly

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:84%
led me to other type of
forms of propulsion stuff.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you attribute that
information that you received

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.260 align:middle line:84%
from maybe this extraterrestrial
that actually help you

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.165 align:middle line:90%
formulate these formulas?

00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm good, but I'm not that good.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:90%
There's-- it's clearly--

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately for me, I know
where I end and it begins.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Which can be very confusing
if you don't know it.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.660 align:middle line:90%
But I know where mine stops.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:90%
But apparently, I can deliver.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever see this
mantis-type being again?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Did you have another contact?

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I never had another
contact with it ever.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But the math and science,
actually, I was born with that.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Before this incident, I was so
into math and science already.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But this was like
an enhancement,

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:90%
like nuclear steroids.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
But I already had a big
chunk of science in me.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:90%
This just expanded it.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept
on extrapolating.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from that
experience is like, I said,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:90%
I've been tagged.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
it wasn't through.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:90%
It came back when I was 12.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
12 rolled around,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I had all the science
books that I could order.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And I built this huge
base to work from.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Then when I got into high
school and you do competition

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
with science fairs, I
slaughtered the place.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I won every award you could win.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So your volcano
bubbled over the most.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, did it ever.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
You had to scrape
it off the ceiling.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, by the time I
was 16, I had already

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
won over 150 awards,
everything imaginable.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And these weren't just
awards in school systems.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I started competing out
in the corporate world.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm beat Dow Chemical Company
out on a rocket formula.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
care about rockets.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
But it just kept going,
and it wouldn't stop.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And it kept--

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I always felt it was
leading to something

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:90%
else, a step-by-step thing.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Then things started
lining up with LeMay.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:17.758 align:middle line:84%
And just so much alignment of
outside things would align.

00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And that would tell me
which way I'm going,

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:90%
because it's like electricity.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Electricity always tries to seek
the least path of resistance.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So when things started
lining up real easy,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:90%
that's where I'm supposed to go.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%
And so LeMay shows up.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:90%
And all this followed through.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:84%
That started building this
and just then ultimately

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
up to Groom Lake,
that encounter.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, you think,
god, it's going to slow down.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.695 align:middle line:90%
No, it started accelerating.

00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Accelerating.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just-- it's
a layer process.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm been layered up till
where I've really got umph now.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.335 align:middle line:84%
But every project, I'd work on
would take me to another one,

00:11:58.335 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and another one,
and another one.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.502 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept getting
bigger and bigger.

00:12:01.502 --> 00:12:04.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Did Groom Lake help also get
you to these other programs?

00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I think they--

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Was that the launching pad?

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:90%
No pun intended.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they did,
because, well, after age 17,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I went in the Navy because they
were trying to force me onto

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:90%
a track.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And they forced me
into the military,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
which to their surprise and
my surprise, most of all,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that was the niche
I was looking for.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:90%
I excelled in the Navy.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I went up five
ranks in four years.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:90%
So I was doing really well.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And if I hadn't-- because of
injuries and stuff I was doing

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:84%
in the field, if I hadn't
gotten injured so bad,

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:90%
I would've stayed 30 years.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:84%
They'd have to get a stick and
run me off, 'cause I really

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:90%
liked what I was doing.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:90%
But it kept laying on.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And the admiral called me
and said, you're resigning.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I am.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm just busted
up too much to keep going.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look
at this on my desk.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.045 align:middle line:84%
And he had a stack
of paper a foot high.

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:90%
I asked him, what is that?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, these are
job offers for you.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's
everybody, it's

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:84%
every aerospace
company in the book.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, we
hadn't even heard of.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm--

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:90%
I got a betting pool.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm in on you.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Which one are you
going to work for?

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And I went--

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.115 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, give me a
day, let me look at them.

00:13:22.115 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:10%
I went through them all,
came back, and said,

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.323 align:middle line:10%
starting my own private company.

00:13:25.323 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work
for all of them.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And he went, hot
damn, I thought so.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:90%
And he won the pool.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> At this time you,
were retiring as--

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
how many years?

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Now the Navy.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> How many years?

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> 11 years now--

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>> This was 11 years later.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> --in the Navy.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What position was
that that you left from?

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:10%
>> At that point, I
was in the reserves.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:84%
See, the way you do
operations, four years--

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
first four years
was active duty.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.573 align:middle line:10%
The next six years, what
they called inactive.

00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Inactive, reserves.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was hotter
than blue blazes.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the real work
was done in the six years,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.962 align:middle line:84%
was the intel ops
and all those people.

00:14:04.962 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the same thing here.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:90%
I did more business after.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's why I've two--

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:10%
I have two honorable discharges,
one from the regular fleet

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:10%
and then one from
the reserve fleet.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:10%
And reserve fleets where
we did all the work.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me in
civilian clothes at times.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I'd alternate.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:90%
So that worked out really well.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:90%
It's an oxymoron.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.928 align:middle line:84%
You're full-time active reserve,
which don't even make sense.

00:14:27.928 --> 00:14:28.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Doesn't make sense.

00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>> But it worked for
them, worked for me.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.977 align:middle line:84%
When you got out of
the Navy, you must--

00:14:32.977 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I know you were
going to basically

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
be a contractor for all these
corporations, obviously.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.943 align:middle line:90%
But what was that mission?

00:14:39.943 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Were you catering
to their mission

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
or-- did you actually
have a mission that

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
was downloaded to you that
you thought was pertinent

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360 align:middle line:90%
that you need to follow?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I've had
close friends that knew me

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:84%
for a while, and the
accused me of being a probe.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's the probe do?

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.997 align:middle line:84%
Learn-- like V'ger, "learn
all that is learnable."

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was doing
with these projects,

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.797 align:middle line:84%
was learning everything
I could possibly learn,

00:15:03.797 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
not knowing what I'll
be using it for later.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>> But just to know it.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And you get to know so
many people networking.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I never had a network.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Network worked me.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:10%
They always kept me--

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:10%
passing me around like a bong
at a pot party, you know?

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:10%
I just-- I was handy at
all the stuff I was doing.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:10%
And also, I loved
working under the table

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:10%
and off the tables and stuff,
perfect for their operation.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:10%
So I did a whole career of that.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you throw in the
technology transfers that I did.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Then I was a professional
speaker with the National

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.613 align:middle line:90%
Speakers Association, NSA.

00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They used to kid me,
I'm the only person

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
they know that
worked for both NSAs.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So National Speakers
Association and National

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Security Agency.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Did all this stuff.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
leading up to where

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at things now.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's always been
on a layer effect.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Everything that the
skills I've accumulated

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
are going to come in handy
for the next series of events

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you discuss
those events that--

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>> When I should be retiring,
I'm about to crank up probably

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:84%
the biggest adventure
I've done yet.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
There's rumblings out
there in the Middle East.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
emailing and talking

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to these people for
the last 10 months.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I didn't even
if this stuff was real or not.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's ways of verifying
things, which I did.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And so now, it looks
like I'm on my way

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to become the director of the
Middle East space program.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, congratulations.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.875 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What are their intentions and
what are your intentions with

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's turning now our
intentions are the same,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
which that's pretty
crazy in itself,

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
because I had some lofty
intentions of doing some stuff.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:84%
The emails that came
through and said,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
we're willing to fund
everything that you want to do.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:90%
And I went, dude--

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an amazing
accomplishment of a mission.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, how are they-- how are
you going to get this done?

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Are they giving you unlimited
manpower and funding?

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And money, yeah.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes and yes.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.507 align:middle line:84%
First project, going
back to the Moon.

00:17:28.507 --> 00:17:29.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Second project?

00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:10%

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:10%

places I want to go on the Moon

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:10%
are the 12 places NASA
don't want us to go--

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:10%
the tower, the arch,
the cannon, the--

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:10%

like a spacecraft

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:10%
slid, somebody threw
dirt up around it,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:10%
whatever that stuff is.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say Moon
bases and aliens on it.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just interesting stuff that
should be looked at real close.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, let's
go after helium-3.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, China
can't get it all.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:10%
And while all that's
going on, I've

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:10%
got hardening of the
electric grids I'm doing,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:10%
and not just United States,
but the whole planet.

Thorium reactors.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll say.

>> Well, I want to get--

00:18:36.042 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the last things
I want to get done

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:84%
is the reconstruction
of Pitholem.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, if I get that done--

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I only made it to
half way of phase 1.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
They stopped me because
that's what they needed, was

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:90%
a first strike weapon speed.

the speed of light.

Well, I can.

is star travel.

but I'm not that good.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I cheated.

It's not that hard, y'all.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Without rocket fuel.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, without-- yeah.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
You just use gravity field and
the magneton of the graviton

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:90%
well of the containment walls.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You just drag that space
over to you and jump it.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It's really count
transdimensional jumping.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Because as you go
through that narrow edge,

00:21:20.747 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:90%
you're jumping--

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
As the walls are whirled
up like a burrito,

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
you just jump from one
dimensional barrier

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.235 align:middle line:84%
to the other, jump
right through it.

00:21:30.235 --> 00:21:31.035 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:21:31.035 --> 00:21:31.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there are--

00:21:31.868 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there're
two problems there.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you navigate, and
how do you communicate?

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.855 align:middle line:84%
You're going to outrun
your headlights.

00:21:38.855 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't think
that's a problem?

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So I have no idea
how they're going

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:90%
to communicate and navigate.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But I can get your
butt there in speed.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.895 align:middle line:84%
So I think somebody else will
come along and figure it out.

00:21:49.895 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you create your own
field of gravity and density

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.025 align:middle line:84%
around you, you could probably
send messages the same way.

00:21:56.025 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That-- I would theorize that.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:90%
I haven't really worked on it.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's a good
theory, because it

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
would seem like it would
wrap up with the dimensions

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.915 align:middle line:90%
and you take it with you.

00:22:06.915 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
That's something "Star
Trek" never addressed.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves
watching "Star Trek."

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you pull the
things off that they do,

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
you'd never know
anybody back home.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:90%
They're all dead.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:90%
They died of old age.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.455 align:middle line:84%
>> By the time you get
home, 1,000 years have past.

00:22:20.455 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, 10,000 years
pass the way they travel.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Interstellar travel
is really difficult.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, a movie called
"Interstellar," watch that.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:10%
That's the first one that really
addresses the problem head on.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
For every five minutes you spend
on the surface this planet,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:90%
50 years has gone by on Earth.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:90%
So you better hurry up.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.655 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to figure out a way

00:22:41.655 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:90%
to get around that problem.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
One way doing this thing
that I'm talking about,

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
it'll allow you to
jump in real time,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still stuck
on communications.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think I would have
a better handle on it

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:90%
than "Star Trek" does.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.328 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
even talk about it.

00:22:56.328 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And they got dilithium
crystals and--

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you're--

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But I don't want to
take away from "Star Trek."

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.002 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty cool
anyway, great idea.

00:23:02.002 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Gene Roddenberry is so
cool to bring it all up.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.285 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it's
a different story.

00:23:06.285 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
and real unfriendly.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What other mission than did
Pitholem actually guide you

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
towards, and where is
that going right now?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Pitholem is the name of
the rocket that I put on--

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.130 align:middle line:10%
the rocket that built
with Curtis LeMay.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:10%
My mother came in
having a dream,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:10%
she saw it and saw
a name on a rocket.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's how we
named Pitholem.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.790 align:middle line:10%
But come to find out that
the name of the entity I

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:10%
encountered in Area 51,
its name is Pitholem.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I always
question and wonder about,

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:84%
which I don't get
answered though,

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen when
they show up and she leaves?

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Do I become a dull person?

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Or what happened?

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Or do I become a
different being, or--

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:90%
God, who knows.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's just wait--

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows?

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> --and find out.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's just wait and see.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.348 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the adventure.

00:23:57.348 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It is that.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's not always
fun havin' some--

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
people go, oh, it's
so cool to have

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:90%
something like that in you.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah?

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:90%
You ought to hear the arguments.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Male and female arguments.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It must be my inner
self sometimes arguing.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But I have a clear understanding
of what women want.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So is Pitholem actually
guiding you, obviously,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
into this area of space to go
amongst the stars and space?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And from there, are you still
getting more information?

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:45.165 align:middle line:84%
Like, what is the goal of
both of you and this entity?

00:24:45.165 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the best thing that
I'm going to be used for is

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:84%
getting projects
done, leadership.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Lord, God, we ain't got
leadership anywhere.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> We can use it.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But being leadership and
management, getting there,

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:84%
that's one of my strongest
fields of all things.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I never really
gave it much thought,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
until a lot of colleagues
are brilliant scientists,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:84%
they just tell me,
man, you can lead

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.173 align:middle line:90%
like nobody we've ever seen.

00:25:12.173 --> 00:25:14.465 align:middle line:84%
He said, you can get all
these dysfunctional scientists

00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to agree on one thing
in one direction?

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how the
hell do you do that?

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's just
like moving through air.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a gift.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Don't even think about it.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So leadership is one
thing that I can do.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think I'm going
to be an example.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Eventually--

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>> An example in what way?

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Pitholem--

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.318 align:middle line:84%
>> The relation between
Pitholem and you?

00:25:37.318 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Pitholem, family,
or colleagues,

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
or fellow combatants, I
don't know what they are.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come
back and pick her up.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, it's
going to scare the daylights

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of people.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But then they said,
well, look, been

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:84%
a host with a lifeboat
of a human over here,

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:90%
how's he doing?

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:90%
He's striving pretty good.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.710 align:middle line:84%
He's really-- Go, well,
that's one of our leaders.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we could
cohabitate with him,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:84%
obviously, it's not much
of a threat to you then.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's
already been done.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Already been done.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're going to
be like an ambassador.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I think ultimately
what will happen,

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what's
going to happen.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:90%
They're going to show up here.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.435 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing they're going

00:26:20.435 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
to ask for, we're looking for
a human named David Adair.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Bring him up here, the orbit
where we're sitting in.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's going to
be your ambassador,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
'cause he's already been
working with us for years.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's already leading them,
a lot of you, down there.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.950 align:middle line:90%
So bring him up here.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.135 align:middle line:90%
He's the ambassador.

00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And he'll show you this--
all this stuff will

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.780 align:middle line:90%
work, 'cause he got it.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard of stories of
walk-ins of many colleagues

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
coming to me.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:90%
This is like the opposite.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.532 align:middle line:90%
I think you walked into them.

00:26:52.532 --> 00:26:53.456 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:53.456 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I always thought that--

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:90%
my wife always said that.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:84%
She said, boy, when
they grabbed you,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
they thought they were
getting this little human.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know they were
getting this dynamo of a person

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:90%
that they had to deal with.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't even think

So yeah, we need to evolve up.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get over
that constant duality

thing, where we're
constantly fighting

some kind of evil side of us.

00:31:26.492 --> 00:31:28.075 align:middle line:84%

>> Yeah.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I'll just get there
in a half hour,

the Moon, if we can work a
deal out there, to get to Mars,

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.930 align:middle line:84%
because there is going
to be a life out there?

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:90%
You want to start addressing--

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:90%
it's a simultaneous project.

on the planet.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:90%

No, it doesn't matter.

00:33:14.587 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need
them off-world.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But use the technology
you're driving forward with,

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.160 align:middle line:84%
but turn around and pick up
everybody that has nothing

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:90%

Bring them along.

00:33:27.055 --> 00:33:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Brother, I ain't going to
leave you here wrapped up

in newspapers freezing
your butt off in the cold.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Take you with me.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Get up and learn something.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
