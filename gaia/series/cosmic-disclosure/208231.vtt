00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:22.340 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.770 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.195 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.047 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If human timelines
are influenced by Greys

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and reptilians, what
about the Federation?

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Where do they fit into this?

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: These beings do not
naturally refer to themselves

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
as the Galactic Federation,
which is a pop cultural term.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But we have seen some beings
referred and call themselves

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:84%
this way in order to make
the communication easier.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Those beings can have a
collective effort in order

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:90%
to benefit the timeline.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
You must imagine that those
are huge populations--

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
many individuals, many states
of consciousness, many species

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and collective
memories and realities

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you can
imagine makes sure--

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:84%
their whole mission to assure
that this timeline vector

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:84%
we are on is directed
in a direction--

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
it's put into a direction
where it eventually

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
will merge the stable time
strain in the middle of it

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to make the
next evolutionary step.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And they have
different missions.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:84%
There can be a species
that puts out information.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
There can be a species
that directly influence

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.289 align:middle line:90%
or reincarnate on this planet.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
They could have direct contact,
especially when everything

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
opens up, and we finally got
to meet openly on this planet.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But they also could do
something in the back,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
which means there
are species that

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:90%
are kind of like code hackers.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that the
universe has at least one

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
access to it by mathematics
and communication.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Language, in itself,
was used and planned

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
as a way to alter and
communicate with the reality

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and to move through
non-material spaces, dimensions.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So there are species who
are very advanced in coding

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:90%
and building stuff.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
They might be in a very
different reality or dimension.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And they build things which
directly affect this reality.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Some might not even be
aware that they do that.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
But as the whole universe
is connected to each other,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:84%
some little changes and
dots and some other reality

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
directly influences
this as well.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have equivalent
dimensions,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
equivalent realities that all
put their influence in here.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And some do that beneficially.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If timelines
are changing,

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
how does the consciousness
unit even know?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, normally, the
universe is a very fluid

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
concept, which means that
changes do not appear rapidly.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Because rapidness
oftentimes means break.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And something that breaks
is a traumatic experience.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
There are traumatic
experiences in the universe

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:90%
with which can be experienced.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But then they need to
be healed afterwards,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:84%
which causes a lot
of chaos and trouble.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
effort to avoid that.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Normally, a timeline that
changes will not be recognized.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
There is some kind of
logical appearance to it.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Something which
is interesting is

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that you could use
the experiences

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
of a parallel alternative
reality in your own life--

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, start to play piano
or speaking a language without

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
ever having learnt
that language.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
There are cases of people who,
for example, had a tragic car

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:90%
accident.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And they wake up somewhere.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And they start to speak
a different language just

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
as a native speaker, which they
have never ever learned at all.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
This potentially could
be an alternative reality

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that's been merged through some
kind of traumatic experience

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:90%
inside of the now time.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can use
that, for example,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to have some other
talents, for example,

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to be painter or
be creative or something.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Because somewhere, someone
has spent a lot of time

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:90%
in learning that skill.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Might be, might not be.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can reach out to that
and integrate it into yourself.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How does the time
unit or time force benefit

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:90%
the Earth?

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: As time is
something that can be seen

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
as the dimension, it means
that it has space to it.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So there is a version of
this recent planet Earth that

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:90%
is somewhere in the future.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And in that future,
of course, people

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:90%
have a different reality.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They have more
advanced technologies.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:84%
They will be more
advanced socially.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And they will have
open contacts,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and through that,
benefit from all the best

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:90%
practices that are out there.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
This version of this
planet has a organization

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
that has access to
technology that originally

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:84%
came from the Greys in
order to reach out back

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:90%
to a version of the planet.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we have talked
about laws and cosmic laws

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and domestic laws
and genetic laws

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and temporal laws, which
means all these are regulating

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
the way someone has
the authority in order

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:90%
to move the destiny of a planet.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Because those people in
the future, it's still us.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's still humans.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.180 align:middle line:84%
They have the right to
decide from their standpoint

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
where they are heading
and reaching out

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:90%
back to this Earth.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are people that
are here on this planet.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And they are helping
and assisting

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and guiding and overseeing
that the version

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and the future
is on the correct vector time

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:84%
string so that eventually
everything will turn out fine.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.562 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is that what you call
a time unit or a time force?

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I actually don't
know the English name.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm referring
to it as time unit.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And this
is a group of people?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It is a human operating
team that is connected

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
to the governmental status
that's going to be happening

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
on this planet in
about 50 to 70 years.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Does this time unit
benefit Earth only or other

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:90%
worlds as well?

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: In a holistic universe
where we still experience

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
dualistic, individual
units of consciousness,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
there has to be some kind of
regulation who has some kind

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
of authority to
what's happening.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
We talked about that, that
different sets of rules

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:90%
apply to different situations.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
We have the domestic,
law which means

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that the present,
local law is regulating

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:90%
on the lowest threshold of law.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's organizing countries'
administrative and social

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
behavior on the
present time right now.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
We then have
genetics, which mean

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that those who are observing
the time string right now

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:84%
are humans originated
from Earth, pure genetics.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we have temporal
law, which means

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that those beings that
either have the longest

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
habitation on this planet
are those who have the higher

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
authority compared
to those beings that

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
are not as long-living on
a planet in the universe.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And that makes time units in
the future, because as we know,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
there are other beings on
this planet who also claim

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
to be living here longer,
having a different time unit,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and different perspective on the
influences on their timeline.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
it's not only humans

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
experiencing and
influencing their timeline,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
but at that point, we
also have inhabitants

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
of this planet that
kind of need to find

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
a political conclusion on
where the shared reality will

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:90%
move too.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the last point,
we have the Greys

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
who claim to be the
overseeing species over that.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I'm
not too sure if there

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
are competing other species who
might question that authority

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Might be.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why is timeline
manipulation being done instead

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
of letting linear timelines
play out the way they do?

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: The cosmos would love
to let everything play out.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And there are timelines
that are not affected

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and where everything
occurs naturally,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
especially those
species that we might

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:84%
count to be higher-evolved
beings of this Galactic

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Federation thing.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Those are very heavy on the
opinion that everything needs

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:90%
to grow wildly and freely.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But we all know
that we experience

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot of beings and aspects
of the universe, that

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
want to have the narrative
as tightly and closely

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:90%
in their hand as possible.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Does the modification
of the timeline affect all life

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, including sea
life and the plant world?

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Does individual behavior
affect everyone on the planet?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Some things that an individual
unit of consciousness does

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
is something that only affects,
in a minor or a major way,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:90%
his own reality.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
That is why when you stick
to that a lot, in the end,

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
you will come to
a failed timeline

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
where you're so isolated,
which happened to the Greys

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and the previous version
of the universe, where

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:84%
you do something so controlling
that you do not give room

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to anybody else and to
the diversity, which means

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:84%
minor changes in
timelines do not

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
affect the collective
consciousness or memory at all.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
If you have a minor
change in the timeline

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:84%
like building a house
somewhere, and even if people

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
are interacting with that
and some other version

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
of the timeline the
house is located--

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know--
the colors change.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.233 align:middle line:84%
At some point you decide
you want your house pink,

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and another version
you stick to the--

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know--
blue or something--

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
at some point the universe,
another force of the universe

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
will decide for one
or the other color.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And whatever your
observations were in the past,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
you will be convinced that this
is the color that has always

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:90%
been there.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And who will prove you wrong?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just decided.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.953 align:middle line:84%
And the observer will know
that this is what it is now.

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If there are
various time-traveling beings

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:84%
influencing Earth's timeline
all with different agendas,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that result
in continual chaos?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Potentially, yes.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But that is why there
are a set of rules

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:84%
to who has the authority and
power to overlook what, when,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:90%
and how.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And, again, we
have this hierarchy

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:84%
of different sets of
authoritarian systems or rule

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:90%
sets.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Potentially messing around
with time and temporal dynamics

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:90%
can blow up everything.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And we'll restart the
version of the universe.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, it could
end into chaos.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: With that technology,
are there small missions to go

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:90%
back in time?

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:90%
And what are they like?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: If a species has
modified the timeline

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:84%
of a planet in a particular way,
and it turns out that this was

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
against law, against those sets
of regulations that everyone

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:84%
has agreed upon, then there
are individual efforts to redo

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You might want to ask, well,
if there are time units that

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
could change the course
of the history of mankind,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
why do they not
undo the World War

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:90%
II or something else like that?

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And some events are
so dramatic and high

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
in their probability
of occurrence

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:84%
that they need to play out
in some way or another.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
They are essential for the
timeline of the collective.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you, for example,
have World War II,

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
the universe wants to
experience some things.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
force the universe

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:84%
not to appear in those
probabilities and to view those

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and observe them and
experience them and make

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that a kind of no-go area,
the more weird, dramatic,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:90%
tramautic things might occur.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So World War II
might be the most--

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and I know it sounds terrible--
but the most gentle version

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:90%
of what could have happened.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
At least the timeline
is still stable.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
There will be a huge
effort at some time.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest it would be
better to do that now than later

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:90%
in order to heal that.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
You could call it
karma or something,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
which means to go
back to that state,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
reframe it, and
put it differently

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:84%
in the experience
of the universe.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In the same way,
are there current events going

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
on right now that are affecting
timelines in the future where

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
they have to come back and shift
something so it doesn't happen?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, the interesting
thing is it's all about

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
stability, which means
the universe and every

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
consciousness unit that is
dedicated to that mission is

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to prevent a so-called
failed timeline, which causes--

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
if it's a dramatic
failed timeline--

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and we're not talking about
individual failed timelines--

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:84%
but a collective
failed timeline will

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
cause a dramatically-traumatic
incident,

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
which will have a consequence
in new version of the universe

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:84%
which is hugely
traumatic to the universe

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and creates more
chaos than good stuff.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I acknowledge that
people, humans as well

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
as every other
kind of life form,

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
are doing the best
right now in order

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
to prevent traumatic
events and to get

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
this timeline in the most
stable status possible.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And I know 100% that's
it's going to be a success.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If we are
influenced by timelines,

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:84%
what about free
will and destiny?

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Is that all an illusion?

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It might have the
illusion that free will is

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
being broken by the
circumstances that one is

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:90%
inside of.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:90%
But that is not the case.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone
who has developed

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
a higher consciousness
can choose for their own.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And they can exercise
their free will

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
even if the circumstances
look overwhelming.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But the illusion
exists, which means

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
as long as there's this
dualistic view of the world,

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:84%
it might seem as if other
people could exercise power

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:84%
over oneself, which
is not the case.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize
that it's all you,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and you are responsible for
yourself and for your version

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and manifestation
and experience,

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:90%
then you are pretty safe.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But still, there is something
about power in the universe

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:90%
which creates that illusion.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because that means
that someone else

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
could harness more
energy in order

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:90%
to bring their will over you.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
That is not exactly
breaking the free will.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the free will, at least
of source, can never be broken.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of bending and
manipulating the free will.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And someone who
could find himself

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
or herself or itself inside
of a very authoritarian system

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and a very strict
timeline, he or she or it

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
could feel expelled
from the free will--

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:90%
now, do you say that--

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:90%
removed from their free will.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the case.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
You can always access
level-six consciousness

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
as the total, ultimate
solution in order

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
to readjust
yourself, which means

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
going back to nonexistence
and starting all over.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I can understand that that is
not an option for everyone.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Where in
your opinion, Tim,

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.830 align:middle line:84%
are we heading with
all this timeline,

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:90%
time unit discussions?

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Where is the world going?

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I think the feeling of
security is something that we

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:84%
will feel very soon
more and more every day.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Because the military,
the authoritarian system

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:10%
and groups on this planet
as well as in the universe

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:10%
will eventually become more
aware of their responsibility

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:10%
to secure and make things safe.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So this planet has
this consciousness

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
or used to have
this consciousness

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
field of fear and
angst, which is enhanced

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
by the systematic
approach to it, which

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:90%
will be removed in some time.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge
and the awareness

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to know that there are forces
overseeing timelines, securing

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
timelines, making
this timeline stable

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
will make people feel more
safe inside of the universe,

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
will make people feel more
secure in their own time.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And through that, every
consciousness unit

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that feels more safe
in their own timeline

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
will also project more
safety into the world.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty optimistic that
in some time, the evolution

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:84%
of this planet, we
will be in such a state

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that we all feel more
comfortable, more home here.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
most important factors

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that people,
that every ingredient

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
of the universe will
eventually find his, her,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
or its place of home where
they feel they are playing out

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
the best potential
and be the best,

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
divine version of
themselves-- that

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:84%
is when all those
particles and consciousness

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:84%
units of the universe
and all that movement

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
through the universe will
give a complete picture

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is the ultimate
experience of the universe.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And then it will turn
into another universe.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have different challenges
that we do not know about yet.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You've had
glimpses into the future.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Are the interviews
and answers you're

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
giving right now affecting
people in the future?

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: One never knows.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the things that have
been given to this planet that

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
had a very high probability of
being very successful have--

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is kind of the beauty
of this universe which cannot

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.800 align:middle line:90%
be calculated--

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
it kind of went
different directions.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
need this experience.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
We need to experience things
to know the actual impact.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I can only hope that my message
is resonating with people.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that people
either acknowledge

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:84%
their own responsibility
or they will project out

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
the best divine
version of themselves

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and do the best they
can to be in peace

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and harmony with our galactic
family and all the other beings

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When the
Pentagon acknowledged UAPs,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and it was in the
mainstream media,

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:90%
there was no big response.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: But it gets recognized.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And recognition, even if
it's subtle and subconscious,

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:90%
is something that is important.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:90%
And you will feel that.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We will talk to mainstream
people that will say, oh, yeah.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a big universe.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
are other people.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
While the same people would
have talked differently

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:90%
10 years ago, like, no way.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.570 align:middle line:90%
No, there is no life.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And potentially, these
might be versions

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.105 align:middle line:84%
that might have failed,
might have gone away.

00:26:44.105 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:90%
We'll never know.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So, Tim, in the
context of timelines and time

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.850 align:middle line:84%
units, why do we only see a
ripple instead of a big splash?

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's good that we
don't have a splash.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Because every dramatic influence
on a whole collective system,

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
it has a huge impact and
has a huge probability

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of being traumatic, which
nobody wants in the universe.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows the more
gentle we go around the curve,

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:90%
it's better to not break it.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When I imagine the
comments from our viewers

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of this episode, I can see them
asking, is Tim a time traveler?

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:90%
How would you address that?

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I have nothing
more to say to that right

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.478 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, that
was very informative.

00:27:45.478 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.807 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:27:48.807 --> 00:27:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SPEAKER 1: Next
on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They thought of
Antarctica being the lost

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:90%
continent.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons to go
to Antarctica in order to, A,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
find whatever's left there--
and, B, place a basis.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SPEAKER 2: We're finding
ships that are intact.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:84%
We're finding ships
that are in pieces.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.470 align:middle line:84%
We're finding dead
bodies, corpses,

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.783 align:middle line:90%
things frozen in the ice.

00:28:18.783 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they're
going to keep it a secret

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:90%
until the whole thing is melted.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, we're going
to be able to see it all.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:90%
