00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are with Ricardo Gonzalez,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:10%
author and researcher from Peru
who has experienced multiple

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
direct contacts with an
extraterrestrial species called

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:10%
Apunians.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're talking about
ETs, interpretation of Jesus

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:90%
and other great teachers.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you again, Emery.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>> From what you learn
about various ETs,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:84%
what could you tell us about
their interpretation of Jesus

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and other great teachers?

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, on another occasion,
we discussed the importance

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
of human evolution
on this planet.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
For the extraterrestrial
beings who have contacted me,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
it is a very
worrisome situation.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
And these beings
considered that we

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:84%
must reach other horizons of
consciousness and not self

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:90%
destruct.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
As we discussed on
different occasions, Emery,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
intellectual
development technology

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:90%
will not help us to achieve it.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But it is wisdom
that can guide us.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:84%
This guiding wisdom or wisdom
that can show us the way

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
is based on very profound
discoveries about oneself.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:84%
These beings who are
in contact with us

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:84%
emphasize this
point quite a lot;

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that human beings have a great
inner capacity to develop

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and transform into a great
entity of higher consciousness.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And they told us, you
don't have to look far away

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:84%
from the planet to try
to understand that.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Throughout its history,
several men and women

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
have emerged with
a great ability

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the universe
who were in contact with us

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
in the past and who
guided the people.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
They call them
the great masters.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are very
special and known to us.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Among these figures,
we could mention Jesus.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I should alert people
who are watching us

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
right now on the
show that when we

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
talk about these great
masters, they must be taken out

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:90%
of the religious context.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
We must see them as beings
who did great historical work.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I'm going to
explain it from the perspective

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that these beings have
transmitted to us.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesus was allegedly
born during the Immaculate

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Conception.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, is it possible
that this relates

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrial
intervention?

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.755 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very
controversial topic, Emery.

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Because here
religious beliefs are

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
mixed with the scriptures
of the times associated

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:90%
with the life of Jesus.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
difficult to understand

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:90%
what exactly happened.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, according to some
skeptics, Jesus did not exist.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
He was not a historical
figure and that it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
was an invention of the
church to control the masses,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
as they say.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, what I can
tell you, according

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to my research, of course,
Jesus is a historical figure.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the controversial
phenomena surrounding his life,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
including his
extraordinary birth, which

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
involves UFO
phenomenon, of course,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I tried to reinterpret
the scriptures, the Bible,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that described this
event, the birth of Jesus.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I consulted the beings
who were in contact with us

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
if they could give us
more information about it.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And we received
something extraordinary

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that has guided us in
this research, which

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
led us to travel several
times to Israel and to Egypt

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:90%
and other countries.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
The archangel Gabriel
had communication

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:90%
with Jesus's mother, Mary.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you will
recall, he announced

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that she would become pregnant
and that she would have a very

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
special child that
she would name Jesus,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:90%
which means he who saves.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
This was already controversial
because Mary had not

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:90%
known any men before.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
She had not had
sex with any male.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:84%
According to religion, Mary was
impregnated by the Holy Spirit.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
did this really happen

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.770 align:middle line:84%
as we have interpreted
it in religion

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or as the messages of
extraterrestrial beings assert,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Jesus's birth may
have been scheduled,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and Mary, a very
special young woman,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
because she was a teenager
when she got pregnant,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:90%
was artificially inseminated.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:84%
There is technology that
allows transmittal even

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetically of the
seed of a man to a woman

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:90%
without making physical contact.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:84%
There are new technologies
that are experimenting

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:90%
with these and other things.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine what beings
from other worlds could do.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And this makes me
wonder if Gabriel

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and other angels beyond the
existence of beings of light

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
or hierarchies on other planes
that we do not know about,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:84%
if any of the Angels were
really extraterrestrials

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:90%
operating in our reality.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But let's assume that
Mary was artificially

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:90%
inseminated by these beings.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
This does not
resolve our doubts.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And another question arises,
where did the seed come from?

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and their controversial
information,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.890 align:middle line:84%
they indicate that
throughout history, they

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
were creating a
gene bank that was

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
a synthesis of the
great patriarchs

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and masters before
the time of Jesus,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
samples containing
genetic patterns

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
from such well-known
and special individuals

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:90%
as Abraham or Moses.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of two other
contactees, it's very curious.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Let me bookmark
this conversation.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:10%
Investigations of the so-called
Shroud of Turin in Italy,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:10%
they show a man who was
crucified and wrapped

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:10%
in a large sheet.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:84%
The sheet, curiously, has
a historical coherence

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:90%
with the accounts of the Bible.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
One of Jesus's disciples saw
it on the ground in the tomb

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:90%
after Jesus had risen.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the sheet was
left with an impression

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:84%
of the energy of Jesus when
he returned from the dead.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It was said that the sheet
and the image of Jesus that

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is on it was a fraud
of the Middle Ages

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
or that Leonardo da Vinci had
painted it in the Renaissance.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
But all of that was rejected.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:90%
They were misleading maneuvers.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And the shroud
remains an enigma.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:84%
What I did want to point
out in this regard is

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that the image of the crucified
man that appears on the sheet

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
is of a man who has
different traits

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
of different
ethnicities, as if he

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
were a mixture of
different ethnicities

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:90%
and quite tall for his time.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the account of the
extraterrestrials who say that

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
from a gene bank
of great masters

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and patriarchs of humanity
was used to inseminate Mary,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
it would explain
all this, that Jesus

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:90%
is a synthesis of that process.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:90%
But that's not all, Emery.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We could go on talking about
the mysteries surrounding Jesus

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrial contact.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you something.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
As you may recall,
not all books that

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
referred to the life of Jesus
were published in the Bible.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
They were removed and
practically labeled

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:90%
as forbidden.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And these apocryphal
Gospels, it is

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:84%
related that when Mary
already pregnant with Jesus

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
was fleeing to the
area of Bethlehem,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:84%
since there was an order
to pursue her family,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
they even wanted to
sacrifice the children who

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
were born at that time,
the pains of childbirth

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
did not allow her
to reach Bethlehem.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And as those writings tell, Mary
had to take refuge in a cave.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
She was accompanied
by her, quote

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:90%
unquote, "husband" Joseph.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
I say quote unquote
because Joseph was not

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:90%
really Mary's husband.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:90%
There was a cover up.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Because at that
time, for a woman

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
to get pregnant without having
a husband was very frowned upon.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
Joseph was Mary's protector
pretending to be her husband.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Actually, Joseph was a widower.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:90%
He had lost his original wife.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:84%
He had several children from
that marriage, Jesus's half

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
brothers and sisters,
which later generated

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of confusion in
esoteric literature

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:90%
as we will all remember.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So going back to what the
apocryphal gospels narrate,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Joseph sent these sons to
find a midwife in Bethlehem

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to come to the
cave to help Mary.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And then something
amazing happened

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that I've described
verbatim from those gospels.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
In those gospels that the church
did not publish in the Bible,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, everything
was silent and still.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
The wind ceased, water
and streams stopped,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
birds stopped flying in
the sky as if someone

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:90%
had paused the Blu-ray.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Who did that?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Then Joseph who could move
and was outside the cave

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
noticed that a luminous cloud
was located over the cave.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
A few moments later,
that object leaves.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
As if someone
unpauses the movie,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.700 align:middle line:90%
everything starts running again.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:90%
A dazed Joseph enters the cave.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And when he goes
in, he finds Mary

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
already with Jesus in
her arms who had been

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:90%
born without anyone helping.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Then Joseph's sons arrive
with the midwife who

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:90%
they had found in Bethlehem.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And the midwife can't
believe what's going on.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Seeing a woman already
with a baby in her arms,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle line:84%
already breastfeeding
the baby, and there were

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:90%
no traces of blood or anything.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Then the incredulous,
skeptical midwife

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
reached out to touch Mary's
intimate area and some kind

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.370 align:middle line:84%
of radiation came out almost
burning her hand, which

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:90%
causes the midwife to retreat.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Who assisted Mary
the birth of Jesus?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
What phenomenon could stop time
while all this was happening?

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
What's the explanation for
that object that was up above?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible as we know it,
there is a slightly different

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:90%
UFO reference.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
What we know is the
star of Bethlehem,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
an object that was moving
to guide three great masters

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:90%
to the birth of Jesus.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But that object
would stop and then

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
continue to accompany
these three masters.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:90%
What kind of object does that?

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Could it be an
astrological alignment?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether
there may have

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
been any sign in the stars and
their arrangement in the sky,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about a specific
object that accompanied

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:90%
what are called the three Magi.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And according to this account,
when the star of Bethlehem

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
comes for the birth of
Jesus, the three masters

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
gave gifts to the child.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's a mistake.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they were giving
gifts to the newborn Jesus.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they were
showing him objects

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
that had belonged to that
baby in a previous existence,

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
like the tradition to seek out
the Dalai Lama, to show you

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:84%
objects to see if you recognize
that you had used them before

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:90%
in a supposed previous life.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
When we asked the
extraterrestrials

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
how this was possible,
they assured us

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that highly evolved
souls from the Earth

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
came again and again
to our world to teach.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So I inevitably
asked the question,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
was the soul that incarnated
as Jesus here on Earth before?

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
yes, several times.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
His last incarnation as a
human on Earth was as Jesus.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:90%
My mind exploded.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I can't
share this with people.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
think I've gone crazy.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But I decided to ask
a new question, what

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:84%
was one of those supposed
previous reincarnations

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And they answered, a
great teacher of India.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I knew they were
referring to Buddha

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and there is something
very curious.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:84%
The birth of Buddha,
according to tradition,

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
was also associated with
the appearance of a star.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:10%
Some traditions in
India say that Buddha

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:10%
was born on the same dates
that today, the birth of Jesus

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:10%
is celebrated.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Although we know that these
dates are symbolic and that

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
they are not
rigorously historical.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
As if this were not
enough, the Buddha,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Siddhartha Gautama's
mother, her name

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
was Maya, which means Mary,
the very same name as Jesus's

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:90%
mother.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
In addition, one of the most
important phrases in the wisdom

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:84%
of Buddha, love others
as if they were you.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
This is also the
golden rule of Jesus,

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:90%
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Then I found a common thread
among the great masters

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
of human history as if part
of a plan and how could

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:90%
it be otherwise.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus rose again, he
left in a cloud into the sky.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
this might mean.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I disagree with those
extraterrestrial contact groups

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:84%
who have said that Jesus
was an extraterrestrial,

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:84%
or that Moses or Buddha or
Muhammad or other great masters

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials on Earth.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They were human beings, great
masters, with great knowledge

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and great inner wisdom who
were assisted and accompanied

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:90%
by beings from other realities.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
In the specific case of Jesus,
an extraordinary human being

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
universe, he didn't

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:84%
need to be an extraterrestrial
because he achieved

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
levels of evolution
even superior to many

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
entities who are visiting us.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
That also impressed me when
these beings told me, me

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
as well as other
contact witnesses,

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that beings like
Jesus had reached

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
such a level of
consciousness that he

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
had surpassed what
extraterrestrials

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:90%
themselves knew.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So they assure us that if
some human beings on Earth

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
reached that level, that
we should follow that path.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus himself said
it, if you want to

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
could do many of the things
that you've seen me do.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
If you have faith the
size of a mustard seed,

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
you would say to
that mountain, move,

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:90%
and the mountain would move.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Ricardo, which
extraterrestrial beings told

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
you about this
information about Jesus?

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I've especially obtained
this information through

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
from Alpha Centauri.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've not been
the only contact

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
witness who has received
this type of information.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was so shocked
by these revelations

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that I conducted
research, trying

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to get some kind of
evidence or confront

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:84%
what the extraterrestrials
were telling me.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But what beings like Antarel
tell me about Jesus, Buddha,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Moses was very shocking to me.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:90%
But then I understood.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if these
beings are very in tune

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
with the development
of human consciousness

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and they have studied our
history in great depth,

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
obviously, they
know about Jesus and

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:84%
some other great
individuals, individuals

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
who are fully assisted
by higher forces

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and with phenomena very
comparable to the UFO sightings

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:90%
that we have recorded today.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, let me tell you
about another great master.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:84%
1,400 years before Jesus,
Moses became a great master

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:84%
for humanity even
though in his youth

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
he made mistakes,
like when he murdered

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
an Egyptian who was beating
a Hebrew, which led him

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:90%
into exile.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:10%
But later, Moses
came into contact

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:10%
with something superior and
wonderful and he was redeemed.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:10%
His main place of
contact was Mount Sinai.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:10%
I traveled many times to
that place and camped there.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It is a wonderful
place of contact

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
where Moses received
many instructions.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Let us not forget that
he exerted great pressure

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
on the Egyptian empire that
was punished with his famous 10

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
plagues that caused
pharaoh to free the Hebrew

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:90%
people from the Egyptian yoke.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And guided by Moses, they
wandered in the wilderness.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were accompanied by
an object in the sky, a column.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:84%
A column shaped
cloud during the day,

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:84%
which at night emitted
so much light that it

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:90%
was called a pillar of fire.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Who accompanied Moses on
his wonderful mission?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Who helped him with the
crossing of the Red Sea?

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Beyond recent
studies that attempt

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that they
cross through areas

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
where the water was shallow, how
can the phenomena of that time

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:90%
be explained?

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
How can you explain
that water could

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
flow from Iraq for the
Hebrew people to drink,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
or that with the morning dew,
the famous manna appeared, food

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:84%
from God, and that there
are some rabbinic scriptures

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.350 align:middle line:84%
from rabbis that say, according
to what you wish to taste,

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:90%
manna transformed into that.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
That is, if a person
wanted something sweet,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:90%
manna tasted sweet.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And if a person wanted or
needed something salty,

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%
the manna changed to that.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Who did this?

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And why does tradition
affirm that a sample of manna

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
was guarded inside the
Ark of the Covenant?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
By the way, that Ark was built
by instructions from heaven.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Moses received this
information on Mount Sinai

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
with exact measurements
with acacia wood

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:90%
and covered in gold leaf.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Modern studies have shown that
this Ark with that structure;

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that construction, with
the instructions that Moses

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.525 align:middle line:84%
received, generates a
kind of electric battery.

00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Who instructed Moses to build
the Ark of the Covenant?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And the other question
is, where is the Ark?

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It was said to be
inside Solomon's temple

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
but then it disappeared.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It was said to have
ended up in Ethiopia

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
but no one really
knows where it is.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And what's inside the Ark?

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
More than manna,
whatever it was,

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
the important thing is that
these great masters of history

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
were assisted by
superior forces.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And in my way of seeing things,
with the active participation

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.140 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I could also talk about Elijah,
an important prophet mentioned

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
in the Old Testament
in the Bible

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:84%
who was taken up to heaven in a
chariot of fire, not by chance.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Before he began the final
part of his mission,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm referring
to Jesus, Jesus

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
climbed to the top of
Mount Hermon, a topic

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have also discussed
here in Cosmic Disclosure.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And when Jesus
was high up there,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.410 align:middle line:84%
there was a great
transformation,

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
a great phenomenon in front
of three of his disciples.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Next to Jesus, a
holographic image

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
appeared of Moses and Elijah,
two previous contactees.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And they appeared beside
Jesus on Mount Hermon.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Because Mount Hermon,
as we have spoken here,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Emery, like Mount Sinai or
if you like Mount Shasta

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:84%
here in the United States,
is another place of contact.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So the great masters of
human history were not alone.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The ET beings that
influenced Jesus and Buddha,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:84%
are they connected
to the Apunians?

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
The beings who are in contact
with me that we call Apunians,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
they were the ones who shared
this information with me,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:90%
who motivated me to research.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But what they tell me
is that another group

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials,
another type of hierarchy

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who were involved
in these historical processes

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:84%
along with Jesus, with Moses,
and other great masters

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about events
that occurred thousands of years

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But don't be surprised
that the same beings who

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
would have been with
Moses on Mount Sinai

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:84%
more than 3,000 years
ago are the same that

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:90%
are now flying over our skies.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years have gone by
for us, but for those beings,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:90%
it just happened.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible the second
coming may be the disclosure

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that we're waiting for?

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a wonderful question.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are
waiting for the return

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:90%
of the Buddha of compassion.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Others were waiting
for the Messiah

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:90%
or the second coming of Jesus.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The shamans of Peru wait for
the Inkari, the secret Inca.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:10%
We all expect the
return of something.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And apart from those
wonderful promises,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
is a broader meaning.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
The second coming is the rebirth
of authentic information,

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
the rebirth of humanity in love,
in compassion, in knowledge.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many call this
phenomenon the Christic spirit.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But when I say Christ, I'm not
talking about Jesus the person.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about Christ
consciousness, of course.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Christ consciousness
does not necessarily

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
Jesus, the individual.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
The word Christ means to be
anointed, marked, initiated.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It would be like a great state
of consciousness of light, very

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
broad, very large,
extraordinary,

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and that wonderful
awareness was taught

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
by Buddha, Krishna,
Moses, Jesus, and so

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:90%
many other masters.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:84%
When all these
teachings come into play

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and we can be
reborn in love, that

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
will be the true second
coming because we

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
don't have to wait for someone
to come and save us again,

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:90%
but we have to save ourselves.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's through
Christ consciousness.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, Ricardo, so very
well put and so beautiful.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I love having these very
deep conversations with you.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being on the show.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you my brother.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There are beings of pure
energy and consciousness who

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
coexist with us, that are
not governed by our concept

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%
of space time.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there is a deep
level of information that comes

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:90%
from contact with these beings.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:84%
This sounds like a dream,
a science fiction movie,

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
because these beings have
no brain, no physical body,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:90%
no flesh, and blood like us.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The goal of these beings
is to reveal to us

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that there is this
magical structure

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
in our world connected
to the universe which

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:90%
has important information.
