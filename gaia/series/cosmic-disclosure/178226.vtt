>>DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
back to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And we are here with
our guest, Emery Smith.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:84%
This episode we're
going to be discussing

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial coworkers.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back to the show.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.511 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks,
Dave, for having me.

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I didn't
realize, actually,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that you were in some cases
working on these autopsies

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
with people who were
not of Earth origin.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So could you start to lay out
for us under what circumstances

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
you might have someone
in the OR with you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
who is a completely separate
type of person than what we're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:90%
used to here on Earth?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: First I would like
to start off by saying,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
not all extraterrestrials are
100% of not human genetic DNA.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
We have an Arcturan that's only
75% Arcturan, and maybe 10%

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadian, and another, the
residual of that, human.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So for the most part, most
extraterrestrians actually

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:90%
have our same human DNA.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just that over
millions of years

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
they have been
intertwining and getting

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
new types of genetic
formations by mixing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
different DNAs and different
types of extraterrestrials.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So is the
theory that there

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
are actual travels going on and
interbreeding in ancient past?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And the past also is the future.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think that
these extraterrestrials are

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
a few million years ahead of us,
actually were us at one time.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually some
of our DNA in there--

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
our children's children's
children's children's DNA

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
could be possibly part
of the extraterrestrial

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that we are seeing today
because they have already

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
mastered time travel and portal
travel and things like this.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So the time is, you can't
really say the time because time

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:90%
really doesn't exist.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But these extraterrestrials
did have descendants

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:90%
that were from Earth.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, so you mentioned
an Arcturian who might also

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:90%
have some human genetics.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.345 align:middle line:84%
If we saw this Arcturian
what would it look like?

00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's many
different types of Arcturians

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
just like there's
many different types

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:90%
of humans on planet Earth.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.913 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some of the
Arcturians that I

00:02:28.913 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
worked with do look
very human like,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:90%
but they're a lot more robust.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're larger, some are
seven to eight feet tall.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.579 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some are actually of
really ancient descent, which

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
their genetics have not changed
over time, which they did not

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
intermingle with other
extraterrestrials.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And some of those actually
looked like a rock formation,

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:90%
like that--

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:84%
one of those superheroes
that's made out

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.717 align:middle line:90%
of the rock you see on TV and--

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like in
"The Fantastic Four."

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.758 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like "The
Fantastic Four."

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And they don't-- they look
like they're hard and rock,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.805 align:middle line:84%
They actually have a
spongy type feel to them,

00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:84%
kind of like an actual
sea sponge where

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:90%
it's very porous material.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
They are usually a gold
or an orange type color.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And they are very robust with
a large Cro-Magnon type skull,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:90%
which is a little bit--

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
about twice the size of
our heads and a lot, like I

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:90%
said, more robust looking.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
spotted on the projects

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
many time in many
different ways.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.486 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
Arcturans that are actually

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
more human looking, which just
have a very robust muscular

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
looking body-builder
type look to them,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
but a lot more Cro-Magnon as
far as the skull features.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And the bones are about three
times as dense as a human's.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's take this
discussion of the operating

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:90%
room a little farther.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
For some reason when you and
I talked about this years ago,

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I was under the
impression that you just

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:90%
went in there by yourself.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:90%
You did the autopsy by yourself.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You had some people speaking
to you through the intercom

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.454 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't sound
like that now based

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
on some of the things
we've been talking about.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The first
year was like that,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
until I got higher
classification and cl--

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:90%
security clearance.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
After that I was
brought into what

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
they call multi-level projects,
which means it's not just me

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
going in there harvesting
a piece of tissue.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
But you're actually harvesting
many different kinds of tissue

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and also working with
the being's craft.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So these projects could have up
to three teams of 15 scientists

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and physicians and
technicians working

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
on just one being and one craft.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And some of those
scientists and physicians

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
are actually of un-Earth origin,
this is the term they use,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:90%
which are extraterrestrials.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Which have volunteered
either after being captured

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
or volunteered
through the system,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:84%
through the
compartmentalized program,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:90%
to work to actually help us.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.007 align:middle line:84%
Because they kind of
actually feel bad sometimes,

00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:84%
even after we capture them
and beat the heck out of them

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:90%
and do horrible things to them.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
They actually turn
around and willingly want

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to help us and stay
with us and teach them

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
about their own
physiological phenotypes,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:90%
about their own race.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would you say that
these extraterrestrials

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:90%
are benevolent?

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I would say they're benevolent.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I would say they're a very
humanitarian type of thought

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:90%
They're a lot smarter than us.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
They could actually at any
time probably do damage to us

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
or hurt us with their
telekinesis and telepathic

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:90%
abilities, but they don't.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, there you
are in an operating room.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that
in some of these cases,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
you might have an
extraterrestrial and a craft.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.617 align:middle line:84%
And you're working on
both at the same time.

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They usually keep the
extraterrestrials and the craft

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:90%
separate.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a
bay not too far away,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:84%
maybe within 300 meters--
which is very close,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because these things
are so spread out underground,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
you know up to 10 miles in
diameter some of these bases.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And you will have the being,
the being is separate.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll have the
craft in another bay.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:84%
These are all very clean areas,
which I can describe in detail.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And I might be actually
assisting an extraterrestrial,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
helping complete the mission,
whatever the mission is--

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
gathering frequencies
using devices,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:84%
or gathering tissue
samples, or running

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:84%
special tests of the
bodies, which actually they

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:84%
can scan the whole body and
3D print that body later on.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Hm.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So could you give
us some examples now

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
of what kind of being
might you actually

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
see as a coworker in the
operating room with you?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Just start to go through--

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Like, some of the first
ones I want to go over

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
are like the beings that
are monkey like, human.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And their pelvises are
not spread out like a monkey,

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
They all stand very
erect like we do.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But they have the
formation of, you know,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
a monkey's look, with
longer hair and the face

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
is more pronounced like
a human without a snout.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it's not necessarily
like "Planet of the Apes,"

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.315 align:middle line:84%
but they're still more of an
ape-like appearance than us?

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Very ape-like
appearance but more human like.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And not that much fur
on the face, by the way,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.010 align:middle line:84%
just around it and
around the body.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.454 align:middle line:90%
And they speak very well.

00:07:19.454 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:90%
They have great vocal cords.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
They have a problem, though,
with high pitch sounds.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So they have to wear
special things in their ear

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
when we work with them
that actually tones down

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:90%
the sound of just our own voice.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course they pick up
on different frequencies

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.775 align:middle line:84%
from electromagnetic fields
and TVs and computers.

00:07:38.775 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:84%
There's these high
pitched sounds

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
they give off that really
distorts them and allows them

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to come actually ill if they
don't have these protective ear

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
plugs in.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is a bizarre
thing because one of the groups

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that Pete Peterson told
me about was a simian

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:90%
group that he called Simulacs.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And in that case
they had genetically

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
modified their hands so that
their fingers were actually

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
these prehensile
tail like things.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.832 align:middle line:84%
They had done some genetic
modification on themselves.

00:08:09.832 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I've seen a
lot of genetic modification

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
on humans and extraterrestrials
for different projects

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
that were not normal
from their lineage.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And I did notice a couple of
these in and out very rarely,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:90%
but they do come about.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we don't get
to sometimes, of course,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
sit down and have
lunch with these beings

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and talk unless we're actually
working closely with them.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But the people that look like
these monkeys and apes that

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:84%
stand very erect also do
not have that thumb that

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.570 align:middle line:90%
sticks out like on a gorilla.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
It actually can
actually grasp stuff.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Their hands are also not
large and bulky like you

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:90%
would see as an ape.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a
thinner, longer fingers,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:90%
and a very broad palm.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:90%
So great operating thumb.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do we know where these
ape-like people originated

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:90%
from?

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you get any briefings
on their system or anything

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe these
come from multiple systems,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
including Arcturus and Sirius
and Spica, that area of space.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And because the
genetic lineage of DNA

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that I was reading in
the library at the time

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
did pinpoint a lot of
these ape-like human beings

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:84%
from these systems,
that they all

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
had similar genetics
from each system.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So you might have one that's
mixed with other ET systems.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:90%
But all the DNA was the same.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the same meaning
they had all the same ape

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:90%
DNA, whether it be 30% or 90%.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Mm.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:90%
So what is their agenda here?

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there's
obviously something going on

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes that
I'm not privy to know.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But what I believe
is that these beings

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:84%
that we either caught or
captured or volunteered

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
to come here that are working
with either the government

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
or the military or the
Cabal on different occasions

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
for different projects,
are strictly humanitarian.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
any agenda at all.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And they could probably easily
take out a lot of people

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
if they really wanted to but
they don't have that feeling.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Being next to one of these
extraterrestrials, by the way,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
including the Ant people
and the Mantis people,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
you have a really
beautiful self feeling

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:90%
being in their energy fields.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And people have actually
had miraculous healings

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
by being on these craft
and working on the craft

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and working just in the
vicinity of an extraterrestrial.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How does that work?

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.533 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I do not
know how that works.

00:10:31.533 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I think it's electromagnetic
of some frequency that

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
allows the body, their body that
already generates a very, very

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:84%
high vibration, it actually
brings our vibration up

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:84%
so our cells are running
at a specific voltage

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
so our own cells
can heal ourself.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Interesting.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you also mentioned
Ant people and Mantis people.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So could you walk through for
us what that would be like?

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
You said it was enjoyable
to be around them.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I think most people, without a
lot of vetting and preparation,

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
would be extremely frightened
if they saw an adult human sized

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
insect that appeared
to be intelligent

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:90%
standing in front of them.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't have fear
of any ETs, and I've

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
seen some really gross
disgusting looking things,

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that people would probably
just associate with pop culture

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
or just, you know, things
that we don't like to see.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Such as, we have an
inner emotion just

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:84%
by seeing the color
red, blood, which

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:90%
is an emergency color for us.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand
that these ETs do not

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
see just like we do in just
our normal color spectrum.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of these ETs see in
variable, many variable colors,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:90%
spectrums of light.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Which means they can
see things we can't see,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
even X-ray vision
for some of them.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have special
coatings on their eyes.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.396 align:middle line:84%
Like some of the reptilian forms
have three different layers

00:11:58.396 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that they can put on their
eyes to see in different light

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:90%
spectrums at will.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Ant people also
have this amazing ability

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:84%
to see through things and to
hear things that we can't hear

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.032 align:middle line:84%
and to actually look
into you and can

00:12:15.032 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
tell if there's
something wrong with you,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.026 align:middle line:84%
if you have a
disease or whatnot.

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Like X-ray vision.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, like
X-ray vision, a kind

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
of light spectrum that
we're not aware of yet

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth
because alls we have

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is the eyes of all
the animals here

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
that we've studied for our
entire lifetime and humans.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:90%
But it's completely different.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of them actually have to
wear goggles just to live here

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and to be here because
the light is too much.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.062 align:middle line:90%
It actually enhances light.

00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
They come from
places where there's

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
complete darkness for a human,
that we would not even see--

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:90%
darker, dark as a black hole.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:90%
But they can see things.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's stop on
the Ant people for a second.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you recall an
example of an autopsy

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
you were working on where you
were assisted by an Ant person?

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.401 align:middle line:84%
And just walk us through
what that was, what happened.

00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:05.858 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well the
interesting thing

00:13:05.858 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
about these
autopsies, too, is you

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
have to understand there's
different types of suits

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that we use, of course, for
different types of races.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So an extraterrestrial
ant person suit

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
does not look like my suit that
I work with in the operating

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:90%
room at all.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And these are
self-contained atmospheres.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
extraterrestrials

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
have to have a special
atmosphere, or a vacuum,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:84%
for them to actually
work here on the planet.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And they also look
a lot different

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:90%
than we do as far as the body.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
The Ant people have these
very, very thin but very strong

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:90%
arms and legs.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at them
because it's basically

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
75% thinner than our own femurs,
but yet incredibly more durable

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:90%
than our femurs.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the robust body

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that could be segmented
or non-segmented depending

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.460 align:middle line:90%
on where they're from.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the face.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people do
comment on the face.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.197 align:middle line:84%
They could have a double
mouth or pinchers on the face,

00:14:11.197 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of tentacles,
and a lot of little things

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.462 align:middle line:84%
coming out of their
face that kind of

00:14:15.462 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
might look a little gruesome.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:90%
You might hear one speak.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
They have special
voice box analyzers

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that come on their
neck and in their ears,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in their
mouth, that translates

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
into a human language, whether
it be English or Russian.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And they talk multiple
languages through these things.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And it does sound
not like our voices.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a little more
higher pitch actually.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And the screeching
of that sometimes is

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
upsetting to some people,
and could be maybe

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:84%
a little scary on your
first visit in one

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.230 align:middle line:84%
of these extraterrestrials,
especially when

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
you see their
mouths open and you

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:90%
can see all the layers inside.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.712 align:middle line:90%
Which is just a normal thing.

00:14:57.712 --> 00:14:58.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's nothing.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying
to be negative.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But we perceive it to be
negative because it's not

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:90%
a smile, that's for sure.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember Pete
Peterson telling me

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:84%
about being at this
Antarctic base where

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
there were several types of
ETs including a Mantis type.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And that when it would laugh,
that it would put his head down

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
because all the
mandibles would--

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:84%
there was three on each
side and they would open up.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was so disturbing for
us that it learned to just put

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:90%
its head down when it laughed.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
What's more disturbing
is how we laugh to them.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: One of the most
hideous sounds I've ever heard,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
you ever think about it and
put yourself on their side

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and start laughing.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
What an interesting
sound that may

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
be for them, because it's
not a normal vocal vibration

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Now Pete also had talked
about-- it's really interesting

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
how similar this all
sounds, because Pete

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
had described the Mantis
being and how it spoke.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there was some
kind of orifice on its back

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that it had to
essentially belch out of,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and that it had figured
out how to turn this

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:90%
into speech somehow.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
That it was this very kind
of strange sounding thing.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And Pete had dialogue with the
being about this at one point

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and it said, well, imagine
how gross you are to me.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, exactly.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.970 align:middle line:84%
What is that thing, that
big hole on your face, sir?

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
It's neat to do the perspective,
for humans to turn it around.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.081 align:middle line:90%
I want everyone to do that.

00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Think about how you would
react to one of these.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.642 align:middle line:84%
Could you accept them
because of the way they look?

00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, how do you
feel when you're around one

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.034 align:middle line:90%
of these insectoids, let's say?

00:16:36.034 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, they're
very comical.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're very--

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:90%
they have great communication.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
The insectoids are very
loving, caring energies.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
They actually
tease you sometimes

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:90%
with their intelligence.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They get a little pun out of
saying things and doing things

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, so
much of what we

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
have in terms of
human empathy comes

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
from these extremely subtle
muscular movements in our eyes

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:90%
and how that makes us look.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But with a set of compound eyes
you just have a bunch of dots

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't have
any soul at all.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.589 align:middle line:84%
So how would you feel humor
from a being like this when you

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:90%
can't get any eye information?

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You don't need to
because a lot of this energy

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.470 align:middle line:90%
is telepathic and telekinetic.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:90%
So you actually feel happy.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.225 align:middle line:84%
You might, like you
get chills walking

00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
into a dark room at night
because you might feel a ghost.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.516 align:middle line:90%
But it's the opposite.

00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:90%
It actually enlightens you.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It actually puts
you in a good mood.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:90%
And your body picks up on this.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of communication
in a lot of species

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
out there with
extraterrestrials is all

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
based on just that
without vocalness.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all just looking at
each other and gathering

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.086 align:middle line:84%
Just like dogs look at their
owners at one side of the face

00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and it tells them
everything they

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:90%
need to know of how you feel.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you feel
this sense of humor

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and this personality
coming from the being

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:84%
without any facial cues at
all that you would normally

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:90%
recognize?

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, because
a lot of these insectoids

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:12.665 align:middle line:84%
have just a very hard
skin, very reflective skin.

00:18:12.665 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:84%
That there is no, all these
muscles moving up and down.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
muscular structure

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
except to open and close
their mouth or eyeballs.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a flaring of
the nostrils, which we pick up

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:90%
on subliminally just as humans.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
different feeling.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It's different aspects
of communication.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So let's go back
again to the Ant people.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had asked you to walk
us through a specific example

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
of where you were doing an
autopsy with an Ant person.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Like what were they there for
and what were you autopsying?

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There was a big project
where they found multiple Ant

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.779 align:middle line:84%
people that were somehow killed
by chemicals of some sort.

00:18:56.779 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot
of them that were

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:84%
brought into the facility I
remember, by the truckloads

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you
have any idea where

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:90%
these casualties happened?

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.893 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I don't know.

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:07.562 align:middle line:84%
I do believe it was in
North America somewhere.

00:19:07.562 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: In an
underground facility then?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I think that
somehow they were discovered.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think they were
probably taken out

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
in some fashion in New
Mexico, Colorado area.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the specifics.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But they did bring
in multiple beings.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And these beings all
died of asphyxiation.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And their lungs were
completely burned out.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And some of their mucous
membranes and eyeballs

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:90%
were completely burned out.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So these
Ant scientists that

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
were there were
actually assisting,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out and see what
happened to these individuals.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now were the Ant people
in the room that were alive

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the same types as the
ones that were dead?

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, the
exact same types.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time
I've ever felt sorrow next

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:90%
to an extraterrestrial.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.385 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:19:57.385 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was
really upsetting.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:90%
That was-- sorry.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: It's OK.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We've heard from others that
you feel 100% empathy with them.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.085 align:middle line:84%
Like, if they lose
a leg you feel--

00:20:18.085 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You feel it.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --like
your leg is lost.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.122 align:middle line:84%
If they lose a loved one, it's
like your own mother or father

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:23.921 align:middle line:90%
died.

00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Especially if you're
working with them a lot.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
There's some sort of
frequency exchange.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.289 align:middle line:84%
Could last for weeks, could
last for years, where you

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:90%
have this connection with them.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- and to relive
that is overwhelming,

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:90%
whether it's good or bad.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And you also have dreams,
too, beautiful dreams.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you know
if the being that

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
was in the autopsy room
with you had actually

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:90%
known these people?

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Was there a community?

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Were these people their friends?

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Or were they just--

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.018 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was of the same
race and they did not know them

00:20:59.018 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of and
did not show anything

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.690 align:middle line:90%
that they knew them.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But just had an affinity
for their own kind

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.792 align:middle line:90%
being so massacred.

00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you ever
get any information

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
about where they come from,
or how did they get to Earth?

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Did you get any
briefings like that?

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I know their civilization
is pretty rampant

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
all over our solar
system and universe.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't know
where they're exactly from.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't read up on that as
much as the other species.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to have
been around a lot longer

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:90%
than the human race.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you describe
the color of their face?

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Like when you--

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah, it's
like a blackish red,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a brick color.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And that brick color
can go in many shades.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've also seen a little
bit more yellow than red.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But they all have a similar
fading of the blackish red,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.114 align:middle line:84%
in and out through their
body and their legs and arms.

00:21:58.114 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are there any
antenna on their heads?

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:90%
They have antennas.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What does
that look like?

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.935 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're shorter than
you would see here on Earth

00:22:04.935 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
with the little antennas
that the ants are--

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
they could be thick, they
could be three inches,

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.845 align:middle line:84%
they could be four
inches, five inches.

00:22:11.845 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Not long like you
see on our Earth,

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.397 align:middle line:84%
like these long antennas which
are like half of the body.

00:22:17.397 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You probably
don't know this,

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
but that's exactly
what Corey Goode said.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I do not.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I never heard that.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And you guys know I don't
watch Corey or Pete Peterson.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
interesting he said that.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because that,
you can't make that up.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You can't make that up.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:90%
It's very cool.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Cool.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I didn't want to
give you a leading question.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, please, yeah.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So when we
have a Mantis type being

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:84%
in the autopsy room with you,
could you bring up for us

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
one specific example
where, let's describe

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
what the being that you
were autopsying was.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
What was the mantis
being there for?

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Why was that project being done?

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well one of
the autopsies we did,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:84%
we had a mantis being with about
five other scientists in there.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.901 align:middle line:84%
And we were working on a
regular, actually a human.

00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But an extraterrestrial human
that was not from Earth,

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:90%
that was born in somewhere else.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were a lot larger
than us, probably another foot

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:90%
or two taller.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I think seven and a half
feet to say the least,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:90%
like the size of an NBA player.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
white, albino looking

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:84%
skinned blue-eyed
person that I don't know

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.540 align:middle line:90%
why we were operating on him.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But they did bring the Mantis
in because the Mantis was

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:84%
able to somehow
reactivate the brain

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
through electric stimulation
from them, even through a suit.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And can memory recall what
happened to the person

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:90%
before they died.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.821 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:23:45.821 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's why
sometimes they are brought in.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're very docile,
very gentle beings.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And when it's not that
serious of a situation

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:90%
they can be really funny.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How much
like a mantis' face

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.196 align:middle line:84%
would this face of
this being look like?

00:24:00.196 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, it is dead on.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
On the Mantis it is
dead on, that triangular

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:90%
shape with the bulging eyes.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's all the same color.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Their face and eyes are
exactly the same color.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little weird.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:90%
They're usually a pale green.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And they can change
color at will.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.202 align:middle line:84%
And it's neat to see
them in deep thought

00:24:23.202 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
when they're doing these
processes because it's

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.320 align:middle line:84%
a wave of rainbow
light going back

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and forth through their face.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You kind of can get
mesmerized actually by it.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.098 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I always love
when they do that.

00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:35.570 align:middle line:90%
I get so captivated.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at them through
the actual helmets that we use,

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
these large glass
spacesuit helmets.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're just so,
just amazing to look at,

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:90%
especially when they move, too.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, I talked about these
other ET that moves so fluid.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But they're just more angled,
their visor is more angled.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the articulation
that we do in our joints.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
It's usually one way or the
other, but very precise,

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:90%
very precise.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When we're looking
at hands on either an Ant

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.346 align:middle line:84%
person or a Mantis person,
are they human looking hands?

00:25:11.346 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Or what might be different?

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.886 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have
five-- they all

00:25:13.886 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:90%
have five fingers, the mantis.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The ants may have anywhere
from four to five fingers.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But they are
fingers and they're jointed.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:90%
And they can move them.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
They're just more
like pointy, and you

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:84%
don't see any muscles in
them or anything like that.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just because of this
exoskeleton like the insects

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.376 align:middle line:90%
we have here on Earth.

00:25:35.376 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Feet are different, though.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Not the feet.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.699 align:middle line:90%
The feet do not have five toes.

00:25:38.699 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What do you see?

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Usually a two
toed type of appendage

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of their legs.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Yep, and it's very wide stance.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:90%
And those toes are very long.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Some can be up to 10 to 12
inches long, but only two.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.507 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll see a
little back toe sticking out.

00:25:58.507 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The toe kind of
shoots forward like this?

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And then one little
back toe like a--

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.267 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what to compare it to.

00:26:06.267 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But you understand
there's a back one.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a Y. Their feet
are like this Y shaped.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So we've been
through, now, Mantis people.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
the Ant people.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
simian people.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:90%
You also mentioned reptilians.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, the
reptilians that we've

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:84%
heard about from Corey are
extremely antagonistic to us,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
extremely violent,
extremely evil.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't sound like this is
the same thing in your case.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So could you tell us about,
what were the reptilians

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:90%
that you saw?

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.724 align:middle line:90%
And what were they here for?

00:26:44.724 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the
reptilians that

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:84%
were working on the projects
that I was involved with

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:90%
were very intelligent.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have much
of a personality.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.271 align:middle line:84%
They're very
direct, very robust.

00:26:59.271 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Not to be funny, but they
kind of look like a Sleestak

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
on the "Land of the
Lost," the old version.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And they stand
very erect and they

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:84%
do have the same type
of toes and hands

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
that you would see
on the insectoids.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They're more like a three
toed, three prong hand.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But very dexterous, very
ambidextrous and dexterous.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:84%
They could grab things
just like we do.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
strong for their size.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You may see one anywhere
from six to ten feet tall.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any snout.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
They have a regular
like human face, scaly.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But very large eyes, twice the
size of our eyes, with pupils

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:84%
like us not the slits
you see in the movies.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It's under my
understanding that these

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:84%
might be hybrid human reptilians
that were designed somewhere.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I did read a lot on
their space center

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and the bootes region of the
Arcturus star system area,

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:84%
where they have a
type of planet there

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that was man made like you
would see in the movies

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
like "Death Star," where they
raise families and educate

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.540 align:middle line:84%
these beings at
a very young age.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:90%
The families are very large.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:84%
The male and female might
have a minimum of 30 children.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And they have a gestation
that's a lot faster than ours.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not nine months.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like three months.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And their genitalia is also
retractable into their bodies.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.774 align:middle line:84%
So it's really hard to tell
if they're male or female.

00:28:43.774 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's another thing
that Corey has independently

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.080 align:middle line:90%
reported, yes, same thing.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Interesting.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.833 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So you said
that these beings

00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:10%
looked sort of like the
Sleestak on "Land of the Lost."

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:10%
And I do remember
as a kid being very,

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:10%
very freaked out
when I saw those.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was petrified of
those beings as a little child.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And they did it well.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they do look
like so intimidating.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't have muscles
in their face to smile

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
so they always have
the same expression.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And even though they're so,
they might be happy inside.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:84%
You would not know by their
face because it's always

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:90%
the same expression.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can only know this by
communication and by feeling

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:90%
their energy fields.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And another thing,
they didn't run around

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:84%
like you see the Sleestaks
on the TV show like that are,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, naked with no clothing.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:35.390 align:middle line:84%
They actually had a special suit
kind of like a Spandex fabric

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:90%
that covered their whole body.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And I finally found out why
they wore these funny suits.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:84%
They looked really
funny in them,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:84%
because I was hoping to see
this naked Sleestak running

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:90%
around right?

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
But no, it's not
like that at all.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very misleading.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It actually had
this Spandex suit

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
covering most of its body
except for the elbows

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:90%
down and knees down.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
to control this odor

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that they had that's very
pungent, that's a pheromone

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that they always release.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.539 align:middle line:84%
And anytime they get
really excited or happy

00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:07.580 align:middle line:84%
it actually just kind of
pours out of their body.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And this absorbs
it and neutralize

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:84%
it using some sort
of ionic technology

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.539 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not familiar with.

00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you
wouldn't know this

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.621 align:middle line:84%
because you haven't watched the
show to not get contaminated.

00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But we've had Niara Isley,
we've had Pete Peterson,

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and we've had Corey Goode
all report on the awful smell

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:90%
that these beings have.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.459 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this was a way
for them to be more social,

00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:90%
I guess?

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:84%
They actually do
communicate a little bit.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget these beings can
breathe through their skin.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And these pheromones
are actually a way

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:90%
of communicating with others.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that their
smell is so good--

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and they do smell
with their tongue,

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and they have a very
interesting tongue.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not split or anything
but it's very long.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:84%
But they don't ever
show that, by the way.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:84%
That's just something they
do, I think, when they eat.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And their eating is
also very interesting

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:84%
because they only eat
like once a month.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And these smells and these
pheromones can be smelled,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:84%
they can smell this for
a few hundred miles.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
raptors and the birds

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and the sharks of the
ocean that can pick up

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
on these small
molecules in the air.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Not to say one of
these reptilians

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:84%
would completely contaminate
a 10 mile underground base

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:84%
with their stench, but just
to say where they're from this

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is another form of
communication of how

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:90%
their emotion is at that point.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It seems to me
from what you're saying now

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that our military industrial
complex is already

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:84%
deeply involved with benevolent
extraterrestrial species.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you think these
benevolent ETs

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
want to be known to the
rest of us at some point?

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there is going
to be some kind of opening up

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.680 align:middle line:90%
of the veils of secrecy?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: 1,000% they want this.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think by them doing
these humanitarian projects

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to show their willingness
to help and work

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.210 align:middle line:84%
with us, to learn their
customs and to learn

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:84%
about their physiology,
is the first step

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
for human extraterrestrial
interaction and trust.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Awesome.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Well Emery, I want to
thank you for being here.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Thank
you for having me.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You're very brave.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.571 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for watching.

00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
This is "Cosmic Disclosure" with
