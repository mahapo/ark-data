00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.180 align:middle line:10%
we are with retired SEAL Team
Six Chief Petty Officer Michael

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
Jaco, who has over 35 years of
extensive combat experience,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:10%
including 11 years as
a CIA security officer.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Michael, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL JACO: Pleasure
to be here, Emery.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: During your
regression with Barbara Lamb,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:84%
you did mention your experiences
on the moons of Jupiter

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and Saturn, having these amazing
combat wars with reptilians.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA LAMB: I think one
of the things that we might

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:84%
be looking for here is
that, in using the weapons,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
what was the enemy?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
What was the situation
that you were involved in?

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Could you go to one of those?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: One of those was
on one of the moons of Jupiter

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and on the planet of Jupiter
where they were infiltrating.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:90%
This was the rock men.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
They had somehow snuck
in through our defenses.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They're very good at going
into a planet or a moon

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and cloaking
themselves in there.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So on one of the
moons, I remember

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that's where I had the left
side of my head blown off.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:84%
In the initial battle,
we went in as a group,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and we caught them on
the surface of this moon.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember landing my craft
and all the other operators

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:90%
landing their craft.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:90%
And at this time, I was--

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I was extremely developed.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:90%
I was in my late 20s.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I was 8 feet tall.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:84%
I was very, very
large; hulked out.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So as I came in in my craft,
I jumped out of my craft

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and started to fire
my pulse weapon.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And my partner was firing his.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
We were able to take
out several of them.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
As more of our
special force group

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
came in and landed their craft
and joined us in the battle,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.080 align:middle line:84%
we started to go into
their subterranean base.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we went into
their subterranean base, all

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
of our technologies
for seeing in the dark,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
for firing our pulse
weapons, they all went out.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:90%
And my partner was--

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I was separated from my partner.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's when they--

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that's when I had
one of their weapons,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
like, blew out the
side of my head.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And my team pulled me out.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So I was the--

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:90%
I was a captain then.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I was the captain of
my special forces group

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:90%
of about 50 men and women.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was put back
in my craft, and I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
was flown back like I described
by someone in the main fleet.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.945 align:middle line:84%
And they brought me back
and put me back together.

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It was-- I would say,
in normal circumstances,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
traumatizing, but we actually

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:90%
performed very good on that day.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
We ended up driving them out of
the moon that's around Jupiter.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was another moon
that they were on in Saturn

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:90%
as well at a later date.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And because of our experiences
on the Jupiter moon,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we had no casualties whatsoever
and we drove them out

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARBARA: Wow.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: So it's
something that, over time,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
as we evolved in
our fighting skills,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
we were far easier
to adapt and overcome

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:90%
our enemy very quickly.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's less loss of life
on our side and on their side.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So we get them to surrender
sometimes very quickly.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we show up
and they just give up

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.798 align:middle line:90%
because we're so effective.

00:04:22.798 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you remember
any other missions

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.423 align:middle line:90%
that you've been on?

00:04:25.423 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And what was your
specific role and duty?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: So currently, I see
myself as a galactic commander.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And in this role, I am
given different tasks.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So I have many
different ET races

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that work with me,
very positive ET races.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about some of those
over the last several shows.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So these positive ETs
and these positive groups

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:90%
from every country and the US--

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:84%
We have ETs from many,
many different star

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
systems that are involved
in these galactic fleets,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:90%
with mile long star fleets.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
power, a lot of force

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can bring to
a certain situation.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you'll just have
one starship that will come in.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll
have a whole fleet,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
just like you would have a
whole fleet here in the US

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:84%
to show up off a
coast somewhere,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and basically everybody's
going to go stand down.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
These guys are your
big time, so we're

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:84%
going to stop
whatever we're doing.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So that happens quite
often, actually,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:90%
throughout the galaxy.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.882 align:middle line:84%
So a show of force will
stop out negativity.

00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And not only in our
galaxy, but now we're

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
starting to travel
to other galaxies

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to help out other
galaxies, because we're

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
starting to master
our own galaxy

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.778 align:middle line:84%
and reach a higher
level of consciousness.

00:05:49.778 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Of course, here on Earth we're
still struggling a little bit,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:90%
but that's soon to be overcome.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And once we've
reached that point,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
it's going to really ripple
out into the rest of our galaxy

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and we can help other galaxies
achieve the great success

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:90%
that we've had here.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You spoke about
reaching out to other galaxies,

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:90%
helping other planets.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't they reached
out to us to help us,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:90%
these extraterrestrials?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: Well, there is
help happening here on Earth.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So there are ET races
that are involved here.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was supposed to be
a very, very slow disclosure

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.845 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a lot
more rapid, I think,

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:90%
as we go forward.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
This disclosure is accelerating
because the controllers that

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
are trying to control
Earth have gone too far.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:84%
They've almost-- almost,
we're completely controlled

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth once again, just
like we were 12,000 years ago.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting to
slip through that.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to
break those patterns.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of those groups that
have been involved with that

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
have been exposed.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of them been taken down,
silent, behind the scenes,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
just like a secret
force that comes in.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Being part of those
secret programs

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
myself, I can see that
those are happening here.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is that question,
that excellent question,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:84%
why haven't we been helping
ourselves here on Earth?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:90%
There are ET races.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
There are over 120 different
ET races that are here.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.947 align:middle line:84%
Once that really is
disclosed, that's really

00:07:24.947 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:90%
going to blow things open.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming soon.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a
time or date on this?

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: I see it as
coming very, very soon, like

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:90%
in the next few years.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So this rapid disclosure
that's already happening,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to see it
on the news organizations

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.907 align:middle line:84%
where they're disclosing
different little craft

00:07:44.907 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:90%
that they're seeing.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.405 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's
advanced technology

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that the space force
already owns and has already

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
implemented and are
using in the space force.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But as we get disclosure for
these advanced technologies

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
out, then that can

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:84%
lead to the next level, which
is, yeah, ET are among us.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are negative
ETs, some of them,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
which have been
controlling the Earth, yes.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But they have been taken
down to a great level.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we move
forward, they're going

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to be completely eliminated
from here on Earth.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Just like we eliminate
them in the space

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
force from different
planets, the negative ETs,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.090 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be eliminated
here, but not by the Space

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Force, by the consciousness
and by the decision

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:90%
of the people of Earth.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:90%
And that has to happen.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The Earthlings--
we could call them

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that-- are having to awaken
and take their consciousness

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
And that next level is
basically identifying

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that we are part
of a galactic group

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
many star beings that

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:90%
have incarnated here on Earth.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
I'm from Sirius B.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So as people become more and
more aware of their connection

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to star beings, that helps
consciousness move further

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
and awakens more people.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So I think within the next
year, as we're filming this,

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
a lot of disclosure.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
two to three years,

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a
different Earth than what

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:90%
we're seeing right now.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The control, the
manipulation is going

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to pretty much disappear
to a great extent

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:90%
as we move forward.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think it's
fantastic that you actually

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
mentioned where your genealogy
comes from, because we're

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:90%
really not from here.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned a lot
about that in, of course,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:84%
the compartmentalized
projects that I worked in.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And what was the most
fascinating thing

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
is that most of the
extraterrestrials

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:90%
had human DNA.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're just all mutts too
of different civilizations

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.810 align:middle line:84%
from around the universe
that have been mixed together

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:90%
in this mosh pit.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.485 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually prove
the space force exists

00:09:55.485 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
prove that there's

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial craft
that came to planet Earth,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.427 align:middle line:84%
how is that going to
affect gas, coal, and oil?

00:10:04.427 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not going
to need it anymore.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Because won't the universities
say, well, they didn't get here

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:90%
with rocket fuel, JP-1.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Now we have free energy.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: Yeah, that's
one of the benefits,

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
but it's also one of the things
that keeps us locked down.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So these industries,
these corporations,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
have been controlling a lot of
the flow of this information

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
because they stand
to lose quite a bit.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, you mentioned
these positive and negative

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials
that are keeping

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.418 align:middle line:90%
us confined to the planet.

00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate
a little bit more

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.418 align:middle line:84%
of these negative
extraterrestrials

00:10:40.418 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and who they are?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.397 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL: Absolutely.

00:10:42.397 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of these negative
races are reptilian.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:84%
They are Draco
reptilian, to be precise.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So the Draco reptilian are
very powerful, have been very

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:90%
powerful for a very long time.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.720 align:middle line:90%
They're the ones that have--

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that changed things back during
the Lemurian, Atlantean time

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:90%
frame.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
They came in and basically
tore down the system

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that we'd evolved
to a great level.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Now they're being
taken off world.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So the negative ETs are fairly
well removed from Earth.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
There are still probably little
pockets of them here and there.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:90%
They're being sought out.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to find these
reptilians, these ET

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:84%
races, because they cloak
themselves extremely well.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some of
these ETs when I

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.137 align:middle line:90%
was in different organizations.

00:11:33.137 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do they look like?

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: Well, they
looked like you and I.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
them in the eye

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and they get a
little angry at you,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:90%
they get a little slit eye.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And that slit eye is like, oh,
OK, there's a reptilian there.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But not all reptilians are
bad, like we talk about.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And not all Draco
reptilian or bad.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:90%
The Draco are on their way out.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The positive Draco are helping
to remove them from the planet.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But just like I was involved in
hunting down many terrorists,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:90%
it took years to find them.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It took years to find--

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
came into Panama,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
it took us a little
while to find Noriega

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
even though we had planned
that for months and months

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.560 align:middle line:90%
and months.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.985 align:middle line:84%
So we came in with
a perfect plan,

00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and then he slipped
through the cracks.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And it took us
months to find him.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So it takes time
to identify them,

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
track them down, and
then root them out.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's ongoing process.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:90%
They're minions.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.637 align:middle line:84%
So they-- you would think
of the Draco reptilians

00:12:37.637 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
as being at the top of
the food chain as far

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.702 align:middle line:84%
as the evil controls
of Earth, and then

00:12:43.702 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:90%
you work your way down.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You have the different
families that

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%
have controlled the banking and
other industries, oil and so

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
forth, for a very long time.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Those are being discovered and
eliminated to a certain extent.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And as we move down,
politicians and business owners

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to root out.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Seems quite
the undertaking.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Who are the positive ones?

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.305 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: So the
positive ones are

00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are trying
to help humanity, like you

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and I. We're doing
the best that we can.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.565 align:middle line:84%
We're working within a system
that is very oppressive,

00:13:22.565 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
but we're sharing this
information right now.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
This is very powerful,
very enlightening.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
As we move forward
with this information,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
people awaken to it, and
it speeds the process.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of us that
share this information,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and that is what
raises consciousness.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like
beating the other side.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It's more of raising
the consciousness.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%
That beats the other side.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, that's
where we're going to go.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
More people wake
into that and stop

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.485 align:middle line:84%
giving away their free will
to the negative groups.

00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:90%
It speeds that process.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
missions can you sure,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Michael, that actually
stand out to you?

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: One of
the most amazing ones

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
was when I went to
the planet Venus.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So I remember going
in a round spacecraft,

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
like we've seen the flying
saucer type aircraft.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
early in my training,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd say probably when I was
in my early 20s or late teens.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.568 align:middle line:84%
I went to the planet Venus
and worked with the Venusians.

00:14:24.568 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I remember coming
through the clouds.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.415 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember coming
to the surface.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
We came down in one
of the Venusian craft.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:43.012 align:middle line:84%
The Venusian craft are
around the flying saucers.

00:14:43.012 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:90%
I remember coming down.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:90%
It was a very large one.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
There was like a
group of 15 of us,

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and plus the Venusians that
were flying the machine.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we touched down, I
remember leaving the craft

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and coming onto Venus, and
it was like 85 degrees.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It was very nice.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:90%
There were fauna.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
There were plants
and animals that

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
were similar to our
planet, but also

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:90%
some that were very strange.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, we would go
into underground surfaces,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and there were
cities underground,

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
pyramidal structures
underground, stones.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:90%
The stones were like--

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:90%
were unbelievable.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:84%
They were made of a metal
that was shimmery and shined,

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:90%
and it changed colors.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Big blocks of stone
that were put together

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:90%
in these buildings.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:90%
They shimmered purple.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:90%
The shimmered blue.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Iridescent colors.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of the buildings would
reflect what your energy was.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
If you were happy,
if you were morose,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.210 align:middle line:84%
they would reflect the
color of your mood.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
My mission was to learn more
of the vibrational fields,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to connect with
other animals and plants

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and humans and other
species of the galaxy.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
The vibrational fields
of every living thing

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
is different even between
one person, one individual,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
You would learn how to change
your vibration so that it would

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:90%
match the other person's.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And this was something
we had learned early on

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:84%
in our training, to move our
vibrational fields in a way

00:16:51.530 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
that we could levitate or move
through different materials,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:90%
the hardest being stone.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I was not able to
move through stone,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:90%
but I could move through wood.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I interacted with
Venusians for six months.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So during that six months,
they taught me quite a bit,

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:84%
enough for many
lifetimes, really.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The way they train
is far more advanced.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
The way their information is is
far more advanced than the way

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:90%
our information is.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
They understand things
on a greater level.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Philosophers from the past
have been trained by Venusians.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So traditional
science suggests

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that the temperature on
Venus is around 800 degrees.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.035 align:middle line:90%
How would you survive there?

00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: I went
to the surface,

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and the surface is
absolutely livable.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So about 85, very balmy,
very pleasant temperature

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:90%
at the equatorial area.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So not the high
temperatures that

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:84%
supposed probes or
disinformation campaigns

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is going on
out there as far as life

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
on different planets
and the moon.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
There's life on
every single planet.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:90%
So there's life on Venus.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We came into their atmosphere.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember there being
clouds and cover.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually when we
broke free from the clouds,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:90%
the surface was clear.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:90%
There were forests.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
There were animals
and structures

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:90%
that were on the surface.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Around the equatorial
level is where I came in.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
about 15 or so of us

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that got out that did
the training there

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:84%
with the Venusians, the love
training that I talked about.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
That was quite an
experience because we've

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
heard that Venus was
too hot to have life,

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and here we are landing on
Venus, and there is life.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So on the Venus surface,
there's plant life

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that can live very
comfortably in that 85-

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:90%
to 65-degree environment.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So when the sun sets,
it's still very nice

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and balmy, 65 degrees,
85 during the afternoon.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:90%
So I have those memories.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I started to work with
the plants and stuff like that,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:90%
the plants were alive.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
They actually un-root
themselves and move.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So these old growth
forests could actually

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:90%
get up and move around.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.022 align:middle line:90%
You could communicate with them.

00:19:18.022 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Not like we're talking, but it
was telepathic communication

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:90%
like I've learned.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.067 align:middle line:90%
It was very valuable.

00:19:24.067 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Not only the plant life,
but also the animal life.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I saw a bear lion.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So the lion was on all fours,
but it had a bear head.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.055 align:middle line:84%
So the body of a lion
with a bear head.

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why that
stands out to me,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:84%
but I think it was because one
of those followed me around.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I just remember it
was like a little pet.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
The animals there
are not a threat.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's no threat from
the animals, the wildlife.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything is--

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.523 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there any
lakes or streams or oceans?

00:19:54.523 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: So I don't
remember any lakes or streams.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I just remember that little
area that I came out on.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:90%
I remember mountains.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I remember snow on the mountain.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So this hot
temperature thing is--

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So there was snow
on the mountains.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And where I was
was nice amd balmy.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So from there, I
went underground.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So the underground
cities in Venus

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
are unlike anywhere else in
the cosmos that I've known.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:90%
They're actually exquisite.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And the people there
are beautiful people.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:84%
The way they have
refined themselves

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
through the love
vibration translates

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:90%
into their physicality.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite stunning.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:84%
When you make eye
contact with them,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
it's just like a
love vibrational

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:90%
dump that you can't imagine.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I was very primitive
at the time, still

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:90%
a very hard, angry warrior.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to train
me, train that out of me,

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about
earlier in other programs.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How long were
you there, Michael?

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL: Six months.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So during that six month time
frame, it was enough for me

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:90%
to overcome my fears.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember moving from one
Venusian city to another.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So they have many, many
cities underground,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and moving to different ones and
learning different techniques

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:90%
for connecting with the love--

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:90%
meditations underground.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, you talk about streams.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful streams.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful rivers.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It was almost that you
could go into a waterfall,

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and you could feel the
love from the water.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Everything was of a
love vibration-- plant

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:90%
life, the foods we ate.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
absolutely exquisite.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, tell me
more about the beings there.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.215 align:middle line:90%
What were they wearing?

00:21:49.215 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: The Venusians are
actually taller than we are,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:90%
normally.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
A small Venusian
would be six foot.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are
eight to nine feet,

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:90%
and some even taller.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:90%
They're perfectly proportioned.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The men are well
defined, muscular.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember they wear a lot of
white, a lot of light blue.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:90%
It matched a lot of their eyes.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
A lot of their eyes--

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them are blue
eyed, blonde hair.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's not all.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:24.680 align:middle line:84%
They have red headed Venusians,
little dark complected.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Mainly, they're very
light skin, but I

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:84%
saw all the different hair
colors and skin colors

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Very stunning.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.483 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So of course,
here on planet Earth,

00:22:35.483 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
we have one of the most massive
diversities of human beings

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:90%
on one small rock.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Did you see any
correlation on Venus?

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: There's
diversity there,

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:90%
but they're all Venusians.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:84%
If you go to different
star systems,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.367 align:middle line:84%
they're usually
that star system.

00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You go to Pleiades,
they're Pleiadean.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Arcturus,
they're Arcturian.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with Andromeda.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:90%
They're Andromedans.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Only on Earth, really, a
very, very rare instance

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
where we have many
different beings

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:90%
that have come and settled here.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
It's quite a smorgasbord.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the few
places in the galaxy where

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:84%
this has happened, where
there's a diversity

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.793 align:middle line:90%
of different groups.

00:23:23.793 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons why it's

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
taken us so long, because
sometimes we don't always

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say just understand.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I won't say work well together,
because we do, actually.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.657 align:middle line:90%
But we're trained not to.

00:23:39.657 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of negative
influence for us not to.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Programming.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: So with the
Venusians-- programming,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So the Venusians
are all in sync.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:90%
They all work well together.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:84%
That love vibration, I see
that in a lot of people

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're very-- if
you love yourself,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're loving to other
people, that really reflects.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you're angry and your
egoic, that reflects now too.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So there on the
Venusian environment,

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:84%
everything translates
into beauty, like I said.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.363 align:middle line:84%
Even the water has an
exquisite vibration.

00:24:15.363 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: While you were on
Venus with the Venusians,

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.440 align:middle line:84%
did you experience anything
negative from them?

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL: Never once.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of
what I learned from them.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Just observing them was a treat.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.375 align:middle line:90%
Always being positive.

00:24:33.375 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It was very tough
to leave there.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I bet.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL: Yeah.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But even in the
plants and animals,

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I had that loving vibrational
experience with them.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- imagine
the most ultimate pet

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and magnify that by 100, and
that's the kind of connection

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that I would get with an
animal or with a plant.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I grow plants.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I love to have
plants in my house.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:90%
I have a connection with them.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:90%
I talk with them.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:90%
I send them love and so forth.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
With the Venusian plant life,
it's, again, on another level.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they
communicate with you.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:90%
You can feel their energy.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:84%
They actually vibrate to a
level where it's exquisite.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing with
what the Venusians wear.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So venusians wear
jewelry which--

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
there's different
crystals and stuff

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen, a very beautiful
turquoise blue type of crystal

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.460 align:middle line:84%
that almost seems
like it's alive.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:84%
You look at it, and it
almost communicates with you.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything is
communicating love there.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just an
exquisite environment.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that anywhere else.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the Venusians
are trying to teach.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
trying to share.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming into very
violent, very polarized groups

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:90%
like ours.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're a massive
conglomeration

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:90%
of ETs in one spot.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So trying to calm those
energies that we have here,

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
get us to work together-- so
if we work together here--

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that's why everyone's
looking at Earth.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
If we get together
and work together

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
here, all these different
ET star seeds that are here,

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:90%
it's going to work everywhere.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.935 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there's
so much focus on Earth.

00:26:19.935 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Why would they
get involved here?

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.352 align:middle line:90%
What do they have to win?

00:26:22.352 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:90%
What's in it for them?

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
What's in it for
them is the ability

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to work with other ET races,
because like we're seeing,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.900 align:middle line:90%
there's only Venusians in Venus.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.087 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they invite some
of us in to train us, but

00:26:36.087 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:90%
and all these different places--

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Arcturius, Sirius B, so forth--

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:90%
there's only those races.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, you said there
was this amazing amount of love

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:90%
vibration and energy.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you gather any other
intel from the plants

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and the animals?

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.787 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: Imagine that you
could talk to your dog, how

00:26:55.787 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:90%
great that would be.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have people that we
hear there are whisperers,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:84%
like the horse whisperer or
the dog whisperer or the cat

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:90%
whisperer, so forth.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:84%
They actually can
communicate with animals.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what I got
when I was in Venus.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've not had that
anywhere else on that level.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So the actual
intellectual communication

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
with these animals, with these
plants, was on the level--

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Even with rock.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Even with crystals.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Even with the water.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The waterfall like starts
to communicate with you.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine being in
the shower and the water

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.372 align:middle line:90%
is communicating with you?

00:27:28.372 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:84%
That'd be a different
level, right?

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
That'd be maybe a little
odd for some people.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd be like, OK,
yeah, that's cool.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I'd do that.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what I experienced
in the space force

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:90%
when I was in Venus.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The communication on every level
with everything that was there.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So I can't imagine why we
can't have that everywhere.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because we're limited.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:90%
We're controlled.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Our information is
controlled, just

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:90%
like the temperature of Venus.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We think the Venusian
atmosphere is inhospitable.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the Venusians
don't want us

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.790 align:middle line:90%
to know that it's hospitable.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us
to know that until we

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:84%
reach a level of
consciousness where we can--

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL: So there's different
reasons, I think, for that.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think that once
that disclosure, once

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
that information really
gets out to people,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be a
little disappointed, maybe,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
but that disappointment
should lead

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:84%
to taking the consciousness
to a level where

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:90%
we can start to travel.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:90%
We can do time travel.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going back in time
and fighting back in time,

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:90%
we go back and visit time.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's with not
to get involved in change

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
the timeline, like
has been happening.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But we get to go back
and be a time tourist.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:90%
That's going to come.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:90%
We get to go to Venus.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:90%
You want to go to Venus?

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.640 align:middle line:84%
You get in a portal,
boom, you're in Venus.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You want to go to Mars, which
is not the greatest planet right

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.270 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.492 align:middle line:90%
But you can go to Mars.

00:28:57.492 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:90%
You want to go to Mars?

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.575 align:middle line:90%
You want to go to the moon?

00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:01.820 align:middle line:90%
You want to go any other planet?

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.293 align:middle line:90%
That's going to happen soon.

00:29:03.293 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And the soon-- I know
everybody's, like, soon?

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Come on, what's soon?

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Soon is when soon is.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's going to happen when
consciousness reaches

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:90%
a point where we evolve.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Why hasn't it happened?

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.515 align:middle line:84%
Like we're talking about,
there's many different ET races

00:29:17.515 --> 00:29:18.315 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:29:18.315 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And because of those
different races,

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:90%
takes a little bit more time.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:90%
There's not the communication.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
There's not the
cooperation that we'd

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:90%
see on another star system.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.725 align:middle line:90%
But that's by design.

00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:31.767 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to learn
how to work through that.

00:29:31.767 --> 00:29:32.930 align:middle line:90%
We're working through that.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I think the time is
very close as far

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:84%
as within the next
few years we'll

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:84%
see this happen on an
unbelievably advanced level

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and happen to a
point where people

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:90%
are very satisfied and very--

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
they were like, how did
we not do this before?

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:90%
But it takes time sometimes.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, from your
space force experiences,

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
is there something you'd like
to share with the viewers

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:57.363 align:middle line:90%
from your awakening?

00:29:57.363 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL: Absolutely.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
The greatest thing
that anyone can

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
take from all of
this conversation

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:84%
is that love vibrational field
that we've been talking about.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So that love vibrational
field is connection

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:84%
not only to other ET races,
plant life, animal life,

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
but also brings us
up in consciousness

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:90%
where the wars start to stop.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So we want that to
happen, and it only

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:84%
happens with the
