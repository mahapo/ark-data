>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:10%
we are with Dr. Robert Wood.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:10%
He's a retired
aerospace engineer

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:10%
who has worked on everything
from ballistic missile defense

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:10%
to the Space Station.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:10%
More recently, Bob is
the editor of a new book

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:10%
on William Tompkins
called "Selected

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:10%

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to the show.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.912 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT WOOD: Thank you.

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, there's no doubt
about how the commerce plays

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
a significant role, if
not domineering role

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:90%
in the secret space programs.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But what did Bill
Tompkins say about this?

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He talked a lot
about mining other planets

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
and I guess some asteroids
too, but mostly mining

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:90%
the planets and nearby stars.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And he emphasized as
part of that the fact

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
that the people who are
doing this were greedy.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to make
money, and that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:90%
was what was driving them all.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And part of the making money
was to get cheap labor,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and the cheap labor was slaves.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Whoa.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: So slavery of all sorts.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you're mining
planets for minerals

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
presumably, you don't have
people with picks and shovels.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You have people who are
using automated systems who

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
have been trained
through their whole lives

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:90%
in a high technology mode.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just physical
labor you're looking for.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for the
intellectual labor.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And the slavery at
the intellectual level

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is something people
don't mostly think about,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.982 align:middle line:90%
but he was thinking about that.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:90%
That was a new thought to me.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, in past seasons
of "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
we've had many SSP
guests on here telling us

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:84%
about their experiences
with the slave trade,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
as part of the whole
commerce thing.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know that Bill
had spoken about this,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:90%
and we've talked about this.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Where are they getting
these people from?

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, he did talk about
the mass abductions as one way

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:90%
to get people.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:84%
He claimed that there
was one occasion when

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
he was talking to a person in a
new building many stories high

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that apparently all of the
females on the fourth floor

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
except for one
were suddenly gone.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And this was a new thought
to me that the abduction

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:90%
could be that complete.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
In that context,
he also mentioned

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
a book called "The
Missing 4,000," I think,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, and that
was turned into a movie later,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
but where thousands of
people vanished at once

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and then they came
back 50 years later.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But this was a fictional
story, but it was one

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that Bill mentioned as
an interesting fiction

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
as relevant to the slave process
and basically capturing people

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:90%
to be slaves.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are they abducting
just the women off the floor?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Why was it just the women?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That was
really weird to me.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:90%
I could never fathom that.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.603 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And the scientific
explanation, were they

00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
teletransported out
of there somehow?

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Or were they bum-rushed
by an elite unit?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, those
questions are a good example

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
of how, when we were
putting this book together,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking at whatever
he typed on his typewriter.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we had the
book finished, he was dead.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.728 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't do the follow-up
questions such as a good one

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
you were just asking now.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
If mining and slave trade is
part of this galactic commerce,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:84%
where does our navy fit into
this and our space program?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, that's a
good question, especially

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%
in view of recent
events since Bill

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
died when we've
officially announced

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:90%
there is a Space Force.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
It even has its own flag.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But my feeling is
that Bill's view

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
was related to the solar
warden thing, which

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:90%
started with the navy.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's not clear
to me at the time

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that he died it was only the
navy that was controlling

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that because I think that the
solar warden program was really

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
representing the good
guys trying to make sure

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
that certain kinds
of alien craft

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
were not intruding into
our sphere of influence.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they weren't
part of that slave trade is

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
what he told you.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:90%
No, they're not.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to protect
us against evil aliens

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and promote harmony
amongst friendly aliens.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, we do have a clip
from William Tompkins

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
about this galactic slave trade,
so let's take a look at it.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.107 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: OK.

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>>BILL TOMPKINS: It's
very strange that this

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:10%
has been going on,
that the same structure

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:10%
of a medieval country,
kings, queens, princesses,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:10%
all of the top people agreed
with maybe France's or Spain's

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:10%
group, and they
became the elite.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
They became the control of the
population in their countries

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and were never allowing
the people a real life,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
never allowing
them to participate

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
in many of the upper
things, and many of them

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:90%
were actually slaves.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So the big slavery business
out there is a big business.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a major business
today, a massive business.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you
want to manufacture,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:84%
anything that you
want to farm, anything

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
that you want to build, it's
all done with slave people.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And in Germany, Germany had
massive underground facilities

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:90%
that were all slaves.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And even to the extent
that when the decision was

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
made before the war ended that
they were going to continue all

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
of their extraterrestrial
developments

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
on UFOs and on every weapons
system that they were building,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:84%
they took their production
facilities to Antarctica,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
but they also brought
the slaves with them.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So now there are slaves
underneath the ground

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and they still are
today in Antarctica.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But slave business out
there is a big business,

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:90%
and this is happening today.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
happened 100 years ago.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on a long time,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and that needs to be fixed.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
kinds of slavery.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:84%
There is sexual
slavery unbelievably.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
classes of people

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that are abducted for
slavery, sexual slavery.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
They want the tops
and the smartest

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:90%
because they're worth more.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They have, I think, four
or five different levels

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:90%
of people that they abduct.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They abduct top medical
research people.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They abduct the
corporate levels,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and they abduct the
most brilliant levels.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they go down
through three levels,

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and that says where
they get sectioned off.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gets to two
planets, and then it's

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
decided where they're
going to be sent to.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's a massive business.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on for
years, and we can't identify

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:90%
where these people have gone.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.813 align:middle line:84%
And just like normal abductions,
we don't know where they went.

00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's because most
of them don't come back.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
We're only hearing from
the few that came back.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.045 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Shocking,
to say the least.

00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But where did he extract his
intelligence from for this?

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That is a
superior question

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's the question
that he never answered to me.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
He talked about slavery
in very global terms

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and, to some extent, specific
terms of the different kinds

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:90%
of slavery.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
But he never talked about the
questions I wanted answered,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and that is, what were
his sources of information

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:90%
for this?

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And why was he so confident
that these numbers were valid?

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the specifics of how
he knew what he claimed to know

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
were missing in
our conversations.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was very informed to see
his articulate presentation,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
but very frustrated to realize
that the questions I want

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
answered, which was what's
the process involved

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.010 align:middle line:84%
to make this slavery
happen, those questions

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:90%
were not answered.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The US Navy
is not doing this.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:90%
They're protecting us.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Yet, here on planet
Earth, we have

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
people that he's
claiming slavery

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:90%
down in Antarctica right now.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.485 align:middle line:84%
So why are they not
being protected?

00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, we don't
have control over what

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
the reptilians and the Nazis
are doing in Antarctica.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, there is
slavery obviously happening

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
is it the humans?

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it the earthlings
here conducting that?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Is it another
extraterrestrial force?

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Really,
Bill and I didn't

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:90%
speculate about that much.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I do know, though, that there
have been some times when he's

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
been asked questions not by
me, but by another interviewer,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:84%
where his response was, I
can't tell you about that.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And so always in my mind there's
been a question of, well,

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
what is it that when he was
told by Admiral Webster to,

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
"Bill, tell it all,"
what is it that he now

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
or before he died felt
he could not speak of?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And I have never figured out--

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.495 align:middle line:84%
I thought about three
or four possibilities.

00:10:52.495 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
One of them might have
been the details associated

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
with slavery, but I would
be just speculation.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about mental
slavery or mind control?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
we know about that?

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many people have their
MK Ultra stories as well as

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
others who are programmed
during their service

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
in the military or
special projects.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.692 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what else did Bill
Tompkins say about that to you?

00:11:15.692 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Bill Tompkins
and I did not

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:84%
talk about the details
of mind control,

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
except to agree that it
was a real thing, that it

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:84%
was generally bad and
was being overused.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I have heard presentations by
several other credible people

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
about the mind
controls that have

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
been used for
specific purposes that

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
are generally
unethical and illegal

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and should never have been done.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.155 align:middle line:90%
But history is history.

00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:45.955 align:middle line:90%
It's begun.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:46.755 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:46.755 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you mention some
of those purposes?

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Certainly, a good
example of unethical purposes

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:84%
would be the claim that the
Nazis were able to train

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:90%
some soldiers like robots.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, people in the
army are trained to kill.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Now the question
is, could the CIA

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
have used these
kinds of processes

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:84%
to have people used
to kill people?

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm confident that the
mind control procedures were

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
very effective and that we
had the complete capability

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
to use the right person
under the right circumstances

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to tell them to
go kill somebody.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And even today-- this
would be speculation--

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm confident that
we can have people

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
do things that have a political
impact that would favor

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
whatever government process
the government wants done just

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
by using individual people
who have been trained

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.217 align:middle line:90%
to do what they want.

00:12:54.217 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's been reported
that some of the same people

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
show up for this
uprising in one year

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and then another
uprising another year.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
The impression I
have is that somebody

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:90%
has got them under control.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.197 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I would have to
agree with that completely,

00:13:09.197 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
especially what's
going on in the world

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
today with the chaos,
which is always happening.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't make
sense sometimes.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's look at this
clip about mind control.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TOMPKINS: I was in a
meeting on the subject

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
with some other people, and
this one young lady said,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I've got one.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And, you got what?

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:90%
(WHISPERS) I've got one.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.422 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:13:40.422 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:90%
I got a picture of it.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:90%
UFO?

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a real picture of it.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:90%
How did you get that?

00:13:50.070 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were having a party
Friday night in Oceanside.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And Saturday morning,
all eight of us,

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:84%
we went to that cul-de-sac off
of Lake Boulevard that's right

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
over Carlsbad-- now, Carlsbad
is next to Oceanside, OK,

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
so they're standing on the
border between the two--

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
to show the other three
couples their new condo

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that's being built
just across the area.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody goes
out there, and they're

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
standing around this fence
because it dropped off quite

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.300 align:middle line:90%
a bit and then came back up.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they took the
picture, one picture

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:90%
of this whole valley thing.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Not a picture like that,
but just straight out.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And they developed all the
party pictures the night before,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:90%
and this.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
You notice it's
serrated on the sides,

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and it's serrated on the top.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Look what's coming out of
the back of it in color.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Five separate gases coming
out of this reptilian tanker,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:90%
dropping 5 gases at 300 feet.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:84%
You're smoking their gas today
because they dropped this gas

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
only on technically advancing
communities on the planet, OK,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:90%
every four to six weeks.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So you could be
getting it today.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Not one, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
They didn't see it
because everybody's minds

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
are controlled to not see it,
just like a stealth system.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So the commander
of this squadron

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
made sure that that
stealth was turned on.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
He forgot to turn on the
stealth that prevents the camera

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:90%
from photographing it, OK?

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So the reason you
don't see these,

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.748 align:middle line:90%
they're flying all over us.

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:90%
There's hundreds of them.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands of them every
single day on your planet.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
They're dropping the gas, so
your mind is being controlled

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and you don't function normally,
or how you should function.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And so again, we are
being mind controlled

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:84%
not for the last
couple of weeks,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:90%
but for thousands of years.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's back to
the Romans again.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Their minds were controlled.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard for us to
accept that somebody's

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:90%
controlling my mind.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And particularly-- now this
is extremely important--

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
particularly because
the brilliant PhDs

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
in all technical fields, these
people are the most important

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
for everything that
we need in science.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But their minds have
been controlled,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
so they won't listen to
what some of the rest of us

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:84%
are talking about because
they know everything.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But what they've been taught in
those books at the university

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:90%
is all lies.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Every technical
field, it's all lies.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
It's incorrect, and
it's preventing people

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to put in the eight years or
whatever knowing everything

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.880 align:middle line:90%
now to accept this subject.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason Congress
didn't accept it when

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.405 align:middle line:90%
MUFON went back to Congress.

00:18:04.405 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
The Democrats or
the Republicans,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:90%
neither one of them.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Oh, their heads were all
knobbing up and down,

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:90%
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes later, it
was removed because they

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
were already
programmed, their minds

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
were programmed
not to accept that.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
I know this sounds
insane, but this is fact.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:90%
This is what it is.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This was a great clip.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.482 align:middle line:84%
But how did Bill know that
those were reptilian craft?

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The only way that
I think he could have known

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:84%
is he had a psychic connection
with the people in the craft.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no other
evidence that I'm aware of that

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:84%
says that that particular
shape has been well

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.655 align:middle line:84%
established to be associated
with a reptilian race.

00:18:49.655 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I'm
also curious, how

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
did he know that this
gas was gas at all?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And how did he know the gas
was a form of mind control gas?

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, that's
another excellent question

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.918 align:middle line:84%
because I think the answer is
he had no way of knowing that.

00:19:06.918 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
about what is is.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The gas, you can see that,
the way it's performing.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's no basis
for his knowing

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.095 align:middle line:84%
what the function
of the gas was.

00:19:16.095 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
There could have been
several different functions.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And it might have
even been locally

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
for the people
underneath there--

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.385 align:middle line:84%
well, I won't
speculate there, but--

00:19:29.385 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No, no,
give us your opinion.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Speculate.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.165 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it just
occurred to me just now

00:19:33.165 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking,
and that is there

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:84%
have been claims that sometimes
an entire airplane was

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
shot down because they wanted
to kill one person on it.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that these gases
were dropped because they

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:90%
wanted to affect one person.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem less
reasonable or logical.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear to
me that the gases

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
were being dropped for
reasons that are probably

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:90%
not helpful to Homo sapiens.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.220 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: I've taken a lot of
photographs and video during

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:10%
my time of craft, and
we always have to have--

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.810 align:middle line:10%
usually the US Navy we send
them to, their photo people,

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:10%
and they have to go
through everything.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, has this photo ever
been analyzed by a third party

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:90%
organization?

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: This photo
was sent to a fellow

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Walter Nowasad,
who is a communications

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:10%
guy as opposed to
being a film expert,

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:10%
but he knows film experts.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:84%
He dug into the details
of this particular photo

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of detail.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And his conclusion in
a private memo to me,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
he accepted the photo
as absolutely authentic

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:90%
in dropping gasses.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a copy
of this photo?

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, the video
showed a color copy,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and I certainly have the
original color that I can

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:90%
share with whoever needs it.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Bill's
claiming that they're

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
dumping these gases out
into the atmosphere.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
What is our current Space Force
doing to protect us from this?

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: My understanding
of Bill's concept

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:84%
of the secret space force
was pretty much extra earth.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
were not looking inward,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:90%
they were looking outward.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And whether they were the
evil part of the space force

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:84%
or the good part
of the space force,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
they were pretty
much all looking

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
outward as opposed to worrying
about how to protect humanity.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.070 align:middle line:84%
In addition, we did
talk about the fact

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that the reptilian tanker
was dropping these gases.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think in parallel,
Bill kind of also

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
claimed that, by the way,
there are chem trails happening

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that are maybe doing the same
thing that are being promoted

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.675 align:middle line:90%
by the reptilians.

00:22:09.675 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But we never brought
that to a conclusion.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:84%
That was just a
speculation on the side.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, he
was never concerned

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
that our space forces,
where we controlled them,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
were trying to do
anything about preventing

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:90%
them dropping these gases.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, Bob, who is
running this whole scenario?

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Is it the corporations?

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it the military?

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it some sort of
political organization?

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the extraterrestrials?

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think asking
the question of who

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
is running the show
implies that there

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
is one single unit
running the show,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and I think the answer
is there is not.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing
is different pieces

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
of people running their
show, doing their things

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:90%
for their objectives.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the corporations
want to, in general,

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:90%
make as much money as possible.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.185 align:middle line:84%
But if possible, they'd
like to do it ethically.

00:23:08.185 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
want to go out

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:90%
of their way to be unethical.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, I think the
United States, in principle,

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
should try to protect their
citizens as much as they can.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But if they do that and have
a negative effect on something

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:84%
else, then there are choices
that have to be made.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a lot
of people running the show

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
not coordinated.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
running the show

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.750 align:middle line:84%
on ethical reasons
and logical reasons.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Some are running
the show for greed.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But there is multiple
shows going on here.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's too bad
because I personally

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
think as a practicing Christian
that the only important show is

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
the love that men could
have for one another

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and that ultimately that's the
way I hope it works out, which

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
means that some of the bad
things that have gone on

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and the evil things that maybe
are contemplated hopefully

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
will be dismissed in
some way or the other.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I couldn't agree more.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
What would you say Bill
Tompkins's proudest

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.088 align:middle line:90%
moment was during his career?

00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I'd
like to answer that

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
by saying there are two or three
proud moments in his career.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I think he was very
proud to be the courier

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to take this stuff around to
the right places for four years.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I think he was very proud to
have been involved in designing

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
underground bases
for the Air Force

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that we never even discussed
in our interviews here,

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
but that's one thing that he
always would come back to.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, here's the design
I did for this facility.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:90%
So he was a facilities designer.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
He was really
proud of that work.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
he was so proud to have

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:15.200 align:middle line:84%
been a part of the process of
helping the navy become a space

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:90%
power with solar warden.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was proud maybe
to a lesser extent of the fact

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that he helped redesign
the Lockheed P3s to look

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:90%
for UFOs, USOs underwater.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.245 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Another
brilliant moment.

00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He had a lot of things
he could have been proud of,

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that he did
these underground base

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
designs for the Air
Force is not something

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that we talk much about
or is in the books.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.373 align:middle line:84%
He's got something he
had a lot of pride in.

00:25:49.373 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sounds
like he was really

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:84%
passionate in those
things you just mentioned.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.867 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With everything
that William Tompkins

00:25:54.867 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
has been through, especially
with the extraterrestrials

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and all the data
that he knows, was he

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:84%
ever concerned about the
future of humanity meeting

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials?

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Did he have a positive
outlook, a negative outlook

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:90%
of where the future was going?

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I think his
outlook was summarized

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
when he talked about the
importance of getting rid

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:90%
of the slavery.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.000 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to take action to
make the world a better place,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and the action he
was mostly focused on

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:90%
was this prevention of slavery.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But the processes
whereby that would happen

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
were never discussed
with me, and I'm not

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:84%
even sure he had
them in his mind

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to know how to do that because
of the enormous complexity

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:84%
of the problem and
the extent of it.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I think he was just hoping
that the good guys will win.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:59.985 align:middle line:84%
He was a practicing
Catholic, and I

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:84%
think that's one of
the reasons that he

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
was so loyal and faithful
to his wife over the years,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:90%
was such a very pleasant person.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.923 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of the reasons
that I became friendly with him

00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
was that every
time I'd visit him,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
she had the right
kind of cookies.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: [LAUGHS]

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But Bill was
a kind of a fun guy

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
who had a great
positive attitude,

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
knew that things could be done,
but was limited in his talents

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:90%
in some ways.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
He was very articulate
in speaking,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
but not articulate in
writing, typing that is.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
He was very knowledgeable about
people and what made them tick

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.420 align:middle line:90%
and what motivated them.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And in a management sense, I was
thinking he was very skillful.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Sounds

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sounds like a--

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But I don't think he
had the solution in his mind

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.580 align:middle line:84%
as to how to solve the
problems of the world,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.508 align:middle line:84%
but he hoped that someone would
come forth and get that done.

00:28:00.508 --> 00:28:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, sounds like
a very wonderful soul.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.450 align:middle line:90%
I wish I would have met him.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bob, it's an
honor to meet you,

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and so glad to have
you on the show.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Thank you.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:90%
I've been pleased.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
