00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:21.910 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:10%
we're joined by Añjali, former
Pentagon intelligence officer

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:10%
trained in information
operations and warfare.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is Richard Doty,
a retired counterintelligence

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:10%
agent who served in
the Air Force Office

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Añjali, tell us a little
bit about yourself.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
How did you go from
the DIA to ET contacts?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Well, I had been
stationed at the Pentagon,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and while I was there, I had
no access to any compartmental

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
programs that would have
any information about UFOs

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial life.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to make sure
that people understand that.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I left the Pentagon and
became a contractor,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and that eventually took
me out to California.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And while I was there, I had a
significant contact experience.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you elaborate
on that contact experience?

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Absolutely.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I had begun receiving conscious
contact from a being who

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
would appear in my
room and would give me

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
messages about what
humanity needs to do

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and how we need to prepare
for coming changes.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And they would encourage
me to talk less

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and to practice
conscious contact.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted me to
tell humanity to meditate,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to be still, to rely less
on their human language,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to practice
conscious communication.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was because
there was an inevitable coming

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
contact between
them and humanity,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted
us to be prepared.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They wanted us to be able to
understand what was happening,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:90%
the context of it.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't want us to be afraid.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Añjali, was this
contact you mentioned--

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:90%
you said conscious.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Was it consciousness
like meditation?

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Was in the 3D where you can
actually visualize the being?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: OK, that's
a great question.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in a room with my
daughter when I first

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:90%
had the being up here.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
She was not able
to see the being.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I was able to see the being.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I could orient him in the room
and I could physically see him

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and where he was located,
which was not in my room.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Behind him was a
completely different place.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
He was there, I could see him.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:90%
We were communicating.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.695 align:middle line:84%
He was doing most of
the communicating.

00:02:56.695 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It was a very one-way
experience in the beginning.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was it out
loud or telepathic?

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: All of it.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
When I say conscious
contact, I mean

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that it was consciousness
to consciousness.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
There was no speech related,
there were no sounds.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
That was at the very
beginning of that interaction.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We did get to a point
where I got myself

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
together enough that
I could ask questions,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:90%
and they would respond.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But in the very beginning,
it was incredibly difficult

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
for me to even
formulate a thought.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:90%
I was overwhelmed.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I had tears just running down
my face, but I wasn't crying.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I kept getting chills
all throughout my body.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It was an incredibly physically
overwhelming and spiritually

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:90%
overwhelming event.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced this three
more times at the end of 2017,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.918 align:middle line:84%
leading into early
2018 in January.

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What year was the
first contact that you just

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
had?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.625 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: That kind of contact,
the first one was in 2017.

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:00.425 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: 2017?

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:01.225 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Yeah.

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:90%
In late 2017.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was late November,
December time frame.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did the being
tell you where he's from?

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Did he have a name?

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: This being in my room
appeared to be about four foot

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:90%
tall.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
He had spindly arms,
a very spindly neck,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
extremely humanoid, spindly
legs, an oversized head,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:90%
large eyes.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see any particular
mouth that was visible.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And slight, very slight nose.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What
color was the skin?

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: The skin
was like a lavender.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And behind him-- this
was the interesting part.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Behind him, it
looked like he was

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
in a craft or some kind
of spaceship home, maybe.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Behind him, I could see there
was a big arch and a window

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that he was standing
in front of.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And then it was--

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
the hallway that he appeared
to be standing at the end of,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
was all window on the
left side as well.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:90%
So he's two sides windows.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And behind him is--

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I only know how to describe it
as like orange, cream-colored

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if it was a
star, if it was a planet.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
It was quite large
in the window frame.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:90%
I could see it.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:90%
So he's orbiting or something.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:90%
He's outside of it.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted me to see
that particular image

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.785 align:middle line:90%
of this orange, cream--

00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: --planet.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:84%
He showed other beings, other
people from throughout time,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.938 align:middle line:84%
that we're connected to
this experience in some way.

00:05:52.938 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't quite sure--

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Other humans or ETs?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Absolutely.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2018 was when I
had the very intense Mohave

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.695 align:middle line:84%
Mountain experience,
where I went into a base

00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:12.015 align:middle line:90%
and met directly with the ETs.

00:06:12.015 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How were
you approached to go

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:90%
into the secret base?

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I was sitting in
a coffee shop with a friend

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.063 align:middle line:84%
of mine and we
were having coffee.

00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:90%
It was early in the morning.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And a couple walked
into the shop.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And we were sitting in
like a large sitting

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
area for a group, which
isn't unusual in California.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And they just came and sat
down and started a conversation

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
with us, and we all
hit it off and we

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:84%
began talking about our
mutual chronic illnesses

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
because he had his
own health issues

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:90%
that he was dealing with.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said some really
interesting things to me.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.460 align:middle line:84%
He talked about the body burden
of emotional stress and trauma.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was something
that resonated

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
with me from something
that the beings had said.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this is very interesting.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
exactly how it evolved,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
but he eventually just said--
he just came right out and said

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:90%
what do you think about aliens?

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:90%
And I said I love them.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, would
you like to meet some?

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, of course, I would.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And he told me a story of
how he had been seeing craft

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
above his mountain
for some time.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And so he crawled--

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:84%
he climbed up to the
top of the mountain,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and that a craft landed,
beings came out of the craft

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and talked to him and
told him that they

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
were located in a base
within their mountain.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And that they had
been there all along,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that there wasn't going to
be any problem, don't worry,

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
and for him to go home.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's told me
that he went home

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and he became absolutely
obsessed with getting inside

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:90%
of that mountain.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And he happens to be a
construction company owner

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and he does excavations.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:90%
He excavates mountains.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
He did not want to
do this publicly,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
so he built a wooden
structure and he

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
threw some military
netting over it

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
so nobody could see
what he was doing.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And he went-- he
said he excavated--

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.747 align:middle line:84%
he went into this mountain
and he just slowly went at it,

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:90%
and next thing you know--

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: There wasn't
a way he could talk

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
to the extraterrestrials to ask
permission to go in, or he just

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:90%
kind of--

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.483 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Oh, I think
that they were telling him.

00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: His obsession, that
sounds to me like they were

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.840 align:middle line:90%
encouraging him to do this.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it was
to bring me there.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I can't assume that
it was just for me.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So he said that he went
in, that he found the base.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
There they were
inside the mountain.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he could
take me to meet them.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, give us a visual
walkthrough of arriving there

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and everything you've seen,
and how that unfolded,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:84%
the conversation, and
description of what you were

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:90%
experiencing at that moment.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I don't know if this
is something that you guys will

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:84%
want to include in
it, in this program,

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:84%
but I do want to disclose that
I did have medical cannabis that

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And that I did have
prescription medication

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:90%
that I took on a daily basis.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
people are concerned

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that there was some kind
of interaction that could

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:90%
have caused my experience.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to make
sure everyone understands

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.515 align:middle line:84%
that that is absolutely not
the basis for this experience.

00:10:00.515 --> 00:10:01.315 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:10:01.315 --> 00:10:02.232 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: And I suppose
that this program already

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.083 align:middle line:90%
understands that.

00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we went to
his home and we

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:84%
were waiting for a couple
of friends to arrive.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about his
experience a little bit more.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
He walked over to
like this wooden arch.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like a passageway
from one room to another.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
There's like a large door
that can seal it off.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
He walks over and he hits the
arch like this, and he says,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:84%
this is where they put me
when they're done with me.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
just what I'm saying.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
When I'm done talking
with them and they're

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:84%
done talking with me, they
teleport me right back here.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:90%
I just end up right back here.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
either these people

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely insane
or this is going

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to be the greatest
day of my life.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:90%
The friends arrived.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.895 align:middle line:84%
While we were walking
down the path--

00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:90%
we took a circular path around--

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
I started receiving hellos,
like a series of hellos.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And what those are, are
faces of other beings

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
who come in and they show me
who they are and then they

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
send with it their intention.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was beautiful,
but I couldn't figure out

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And I would just throw
my hands to my head

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and say, what the
heck is going on?

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we arrived at the tunnel.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
We walked under the
wooden structure.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.748 align:middle line:90%
He pulled back.

00:11:49.748 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So in the back
of the wooden structure,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:90%
there's like a tunnel--

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.275 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: There is.

00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --or a
door or something.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.438 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: We walked along the--

00:11:56.438 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Edge of the mountain.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.313 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: --the
side of the mountain.

00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was a wooden structure
that was quite long against it.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to the end
of the wooden structure,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:90%
the tunnel was here.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And so Lorenzo pulled
back the tunnel.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It was cooler, slightly
cooler, slightly damper,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:90%
not really breezy, but--

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
We walked in, Brian led
the way, and I was walking

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:90%
through an excavated tunnel.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.650 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I had to wash my feet, make
sure I wasn't tripping.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:90%
I could stand up straight.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Lorenzo was the tallest.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:84%
He was hunched over
a little bit more.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:90%
The two girls were in the back.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:90%
They'd all been here before.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And we continued
down the tunnel,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and we could see
a light that was

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
hitting the side of the
tunnel and lighting up

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:90%
a section of it.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And he said that's the turn.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.137 align:middle line:90%
We're getting close now.

00:13:07.137 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was that like a
man-made light or a light just

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:90%
emanating from the cave there?

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: It was ambient light
emanating from somewhere around

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:90%
the corner that I couldn't see.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And we turned to the
corner, and there they were.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
They were standing
inside of their base.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
There was like a seamless
transition from the tunnel

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
into their base.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a grey who was
standing there and there were

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:90%
three tall whites.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.215 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to call them tall
whites because I've been taught

00:13:42.215 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:10%
that that's what they were.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know any of this.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And they greeted me.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- without
a single hesitation,

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I just walked right into
the base right up to them.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you just walked
through this entryway from

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:90%
the cave into--

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:84%
do you believe was it maybe a
craft or was it an actual base?

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: I don't know.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: You don't know?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I don't know
that I'll ever know.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.167 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: But there was no--

00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
you didn't feel anything
when you made that transition

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:90%
into this area.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: It was kind
of like walking into--

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.833 align:middle line:84%
I was conscious, but my mind
was getting a little cloudy.

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:24.875 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I was a little foggy.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to them
and they were talking to me,

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and none of us were
using our mouths.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
It was all through
conscious communication.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When you
first met those beings,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
what were your feelings and
emotions right off the bat?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Initially, my very
first reaction was, I knew it.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And then my second
reaction was just pure joy.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.842 align:middle line:90%
And I just walked up to them.

00:14:54.842 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did
they welcome you?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: They were kind of
playing like they had been

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:90%
waiting to see me.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what a surprise.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:84%
We've been waiting
to talk to you.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And I realize now that
there was no surprise.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:90%
This was all orchestrated.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:90%
What did you see--

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.038 align:middle line:84%
the first step in, the
beings that were there,

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
you had one being right
there greeting you.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's right.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.843 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And then what
did you see around you?

00:15:18.843 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:90%
What was that setting?

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Describe that in detail.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I was standing
like in an alcove.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a large
half-dome door.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
To my right, there was
a hallway at this angle

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:90%
from where I was standing.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Directly in front of
me was another door

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
just like this, another arch,
which I think was a door,

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
from things I learned when
I went down that hallway.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And then on this side was black.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like a
dark wall or like--

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: No, it's
like it's being--

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --you're
look at a deep space.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: It's like
it's being masked.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:84%
They won't let me
see what it is.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't see it.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like a cloaking
device or something.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Yeah.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:90%
It's completely black.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you
describe in detail--

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:84%
because you said there
was two different beings.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You had the tall whites, you
had the small 4-and-1/2 foot

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:90%
beings--

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's right.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --that
you're used to seeing.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's right.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, let's describe
first, the tall white two.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:90%
How did he look or she?

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: OK, there
were three beings.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Two appeared to be male.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:90%
One appeared to be female.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
They were all extremely
tall, well over 6 feet tall.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.465 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
dressed the same.

00:16:26.465 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What
were they wearing?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: They were wearing
like dark blue and black

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
overall suit, almost like a wet
suit, but not quite that tight.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And black boots, like thick,
really thick black boots

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.417 align:middle line:84%
like what you would get
issued from the military.

00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me about
the facial features.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
You said they're
tall, above 6 feet,

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of this
bluish-white color.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's right.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:90%
They had very--

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They have hair?

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Absolutely.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
They had hair,
whitish or very white.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:84%
When I say whitish, I mean
it was like bluish-white.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
If they were appearing to me
the way that they actually look,

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
they're the only ones that
could walk down the street.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.635 align:middle line:84%
And maybe with
the right makeup--

00:17:10.635 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Can they get away?

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.432 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: --nobody
will even notice.

00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:90%
They didn't speak to me.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
They looked at me like they
were just assessing me.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:90%
I felt some arrogance.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they weren't doing
the telepathy that the greys

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:90%
were doing with you.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: They didn't--
never spoke to me.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I felt like they
were escorting me,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:90%
like maybe they were security.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you mentioned that
you felt like this was a male

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:84%
What presence that
they gave you,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that was like, oh, this might
be female, this might be male?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
to that conclusion?

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: The tall
beings, like I was saying,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
they looked very human, except
the colors of their skin

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that they
were just stunning.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.290 align:middle line:90%
The men had short hair.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And the women had-- the
woman, she had long hair.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:90%
It was to her shoulders.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:90%
All of their hair was thinner.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.642 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like
huge and luxurious.

00:18:02.642 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about
the facial features?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:90%
More masculine or more feminine?

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I really feel like
their features are so similar

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:90%
that you rely on other things.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:19.551 align:middle line:84%
There's almost like an androgyny
to the face, very assessing.

00:18:19.551 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You felt like
they were scanning you.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Oh, yeah.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Those eyes, I could
tell that they

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:90%
weren't very impressed with me.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD C. DOTY: Añjali,
what color was the hair?

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.652 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I guess I would have
to say a cooler white hair.

00:18:34.652 --> 00:18:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: What was the
length of the hair?

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: The ones
that I perceived as men,

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:84%
they had the square shoulders
and they had their hair cut

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
shorter like men
do in our society.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman who
was present, who had--

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
her hair was parted on
the side and it came down

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:90%
to her shoulders.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Did you have the
impression that the hairstyle

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
or appearance was
there to please you,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
or did you have the idea that
it was their natural look?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: When I was
there, I had no idea,

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:90%
one way or the other.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I would probably venture
to say that maybe that is

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:90%
what they look like.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do you think the
agenda was for you to go there?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what information
did they share with you?

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Well, after they
took me down the hallway,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.567 align:middle line:84%
they took me into another
room or into a room.

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:90%
First and only room, but--

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.893 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Like a square room?

00:19:35.893 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: It was-- well,
the doorway was another one

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:90%
of those doorways.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
until this moment

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that it was like a pocket
door, the ones that slide in.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And it slid open, and
on the other side of

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
it was a very tall
being that was appearing

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
to be a cross between
humanoid and insectoid,

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and I would say more mantid
in the insectoid side.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And was presenting
with the color of skin

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that the being in my
room had been presenting.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And greeted me with
like this smile.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
a physical smile

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean like an image
of just pure happiness.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And almost like a
ta-da, see, here I am.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm real.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:90%
that sort of--

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.603 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was the head
shaped like a mantis?

00:20:33.603 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:90%
You say mantis hybrid human.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's go over the details
of how that body looks.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Bulbous head, kind of
like it's bigger around in this

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
area than ours.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:90%
It comes down narrower.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.470 align:middle line:90%
And large eyes that come around.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.555 align:middle line:90%
And a very spindly neck.

00:20:57.555 --> 00:20:59.555 align:middle line:84%
Everything else about it
was just very delicate.

00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:00.888 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: So two arms, two legs.

00:21:00.888 --> 00:21:03.785 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Two arms, two
legs, very, very tall.

00:21:03.785 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Tall.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: When I was
standing in the hallway,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:90%
it was on the other side of--

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:84%
or they were on the
other side of the door.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And the ceiling in that room is
much higher than the hallway.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
standing in the hallway,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even see--

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see who it was.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It was as I was walking through,
and they were kind of like--

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are we talking
like 7 feet, 8 feet tall?

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Exactly.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult for
me to even measure

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
because it was definitely the
tallest being in the room.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And in this room were multiple
races of beings, and--

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like how many are we
talking about different races?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: I'm not sure.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow, that many.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: I'm not sure.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:84%
There were probably--
if I had to estimate--

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
about 40 other beings that
were in the room at the time.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.197 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say 20 to 40.

00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Different races.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: And I know that that
sounds like a huge difference,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:90%
but it was all very confusing.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking around at
multiple kinds of beings

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:90%
that I've never--

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
consciously, that I can't
remember ever seeing before,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm having a very
tactile physical experience.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
bizarre going on.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The floor is normal,
the walls are normal,

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:84%
everything is normal,
except the fact

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
that I'm looking
at these beings.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.942 align:middle line:90%
And I'm feeling a little wooey.

00:22:34.942 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And
where's your team at?

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.817 align:middle line:84%
All the people
that came with you,

00:22:37.817 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
are they experiencing
the same thing you are?

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Do they wander off
or are they with you?

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: So when I stepped
in the grey, which actually,

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:90%
that's, I believe, a misnomer.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I am pretty certain that it was
actually a droid of some sort

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and not the biological
grey that we often see,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:84%
but very much looked like
one, just much smaller.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Brian wanted to come,
and they said no.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They told everyone
to return home,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.667 align:middle line:90%
and they would bring me back.

00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:17.125 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did that happen right
when you came in or is that

00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:90%
when you met the mantis?

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Pretty much.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Within probably the
first 30 seconds.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Brian wanted to come in.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.050 align:middle line:90%
They said no.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
To his credit, that man whom
I had just met that day, said,

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not leaving.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
He was like, I'm
not leaving her.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm staying here.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK, fine.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Stay there.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:84%
That was the kind of
attitude about it.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing
about it that gave me

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.100 align:middle line:84%
the heebie-jeebies
a little bit, is

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:84%
that at the end of this contact
when they were bringing me back

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to the alcove, Brian
was standing there

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and he looked like
he hadn't moved.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:90%
He was just standing there.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Like he was almost in like
suspension or something.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Añjali, first of all,
when Brian was making this

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:90%
statement, was it through words?

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Was he talking out loud?

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: No.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:84%
No, it was absolutely
fascinating.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
They were talking to each
other, and I could hear them.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was all through
conscious communication.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So no one's mouths
were moving, but I

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:84%
could hear everyone
talking to one another.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.795 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: What was your
emotional state at that time?

00:24:25.795 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Were you frightened?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: No.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Especially when you
saw this insect-looking--

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Oh, no.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.890 align:middle line:84%
When I went in
there and I realized

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
who it was, that it was
the being that I had seen

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.920 align:middle line:84%
three other times prior, and it
was giving me these messages,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:90%
I was overjoyed.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:90%
I was overjoyed.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:90%
It was like, ah, it's true.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not all in my head.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was just elated
the whole time.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
made me hesitant--

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:90%
there were a few things--

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
one was the tall beings
that were with us.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
they were very aloof

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and they never spoke to me,
and they would just kind of

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
look at me like they just
didn't approve of me.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
they just don't like

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.200 align:middle line:90%
people and human biotechnology.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Oh, they're
like that all the time.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:90%
They just act like that.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.793 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Are they
arrogant that way?

00:25:18.793 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Don't
take it to heart.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The tall ones, were
you frightened at all with

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
their appearance
or how you felt,

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:34.620 align:middle line:84%
based on what they were relaying
or the feelings that you got

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:90%
from them?

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: No, I was
curious about them.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, I was jumping
into intelligence officer mode

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
because I started
trying to assess why

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:90%
they were dressed that way--

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:90%
all of them the same--

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
why were they following us, why
were they just staring at me,

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:84%
why weren't they
speaking to me, what was

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:90%
their function, essentially?

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:90%
They had to have a function.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:84%
It was obvious
that the little one

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to greet me
and take me to the room.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't figure out
what their role is.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it just it kind of hit
me, oh, it's like security.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
physical bodies.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: From the time you
entered that cave till the time

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.500 align:middle line:84%
you left, was your feeling
all euphoric or was there ever

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
a frightening experience
or an unusual anticipation

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of something of the unknown?

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: There was one moment
when I was in the large room--

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:84%
you had asked what
the room looked like.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:90%
It was a large circular room.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember there being one door
on that side of the circle.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
was the only door,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.352 align:middle line:90%
but I remember that door.

00:26:55.352 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:84%
There was like a metal bed
that came up out of the floor,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted
me to lay down on.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
laying down on that,

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there
were a set of windows

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that were going around the
top like an observation deck,

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but they were all blacked
out and I couldn't see them.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
to myself, who's

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of those windows?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: How high was
this room, the ceiling,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and what was the
shape of the ceiling?

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I think it was domed,
but I had lights in my eyes.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I would say those windows may
have been up 20, 30 feet high.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:90%
There were a number of them.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking to
myself, I'm on this table,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a room full of
other races of beings,

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
my mind is being
blown, who would

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:90%
have to hide behind windows?

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Humans.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Humans have to hide
behind those windows.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
This was what I would
call an observation

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.220 align:middle line:90%
deck, like an old surgery--

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.853 align:middle line:90%
You're looking down.

00:28:13.853 --> 00:28:16.395 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Looking down so that
they could see what was going

00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:90%
on, but I couldn't see.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:17.820 align:middle line:90%
They're the only one--

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.862 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So was that like
a holding cell for all

00:28:19.862 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
the different ETs,
and here you are,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.512 align:middle line:84%
a human coming in, and
there's 40 other races there,

00:28:25.512 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and you have this
observation deck?

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.972 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you informed
of what that room was

00:28:29.972 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:90%
and why you were there?

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.277 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: I got a medical exam.

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, there we go.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.443 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That's a question
I was going to ask you.

00:28:35.443 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Were you physically
examined by them--

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.240 align:middle line:90%
a medical examination?

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.040 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
reasons that I was there,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:84%
while I laid down on this
table like they asked me.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was-- above
the table, there

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:56.745 align:middle line:84%
was like a rectangle,
that with inside of it,

00:28:56.745 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:90%
it was like all light.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you can imagine
like mist that is light.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Like misty--

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Mm-hmm, sure.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Like the misty air.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Illuminated mist.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Illuminated mist, yes.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Illuminated
mist, absolutely.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I have been trying to figure
out a way to describe that.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's
what we call it.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's what we call it.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Illuminated mist.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm laying on this table,
and there's a illuminated mist

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:90%
above me that's coming down.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that I'm
outside of my body.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And over here is the lavender
being, who's talking to me

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:90%
and telling me things.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:84%
While over here,
I'm being examined,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and they're telling the lavender
being what they're finding.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: How were you examined?

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.728 align:middle line:90%
With a device, some--

00:29:51.728 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I have
absolutely no idea.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:84%
They removed my
consciousness from my body.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:90%
I was floating above my body.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I could see it below me, and I
was looking up into the mist.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the
mist was for healing

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:90%
and for diagnostics.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And then these people over
here were saying things

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:84%
like, she has medication
that's causing seizures.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.160 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong
with her root chakra.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.740 align:middle line:84%
She's sicker than she
was supposed to be.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:90%
We weren't expecting this.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
They were saying this kind of
thing-- all of these things,

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and I was hearing them, but
they weren't talking to me.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:90%
They were talking to each other.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
The only one talking to
me was the lavender being.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What was he saying?

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: He was telling me
that this was part of a council

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of beings that are like
guardians of this world

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:90%
and of the physical planet.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They're guardians
of this creation.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.510 align:middle line:90%
That they know this creator.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And that I am here to deliver
messages on their behalf,

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and that this is my job.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:84%
That I do this over
and over again.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:13.660 align:middle line:84%
That I've never done
it here in this world.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:84%
That I've done it in
other places where

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:84%
other human
biotechnology is being

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:84%
used to create like a
conscious awakening,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:84%
a conscious awareness and
growth for the sake of future

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:90%
creations.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.890 align:middle line:90%
To take it into--

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:84%
to take the knowledge and
the wisdom that is learned,

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
so that it can coalesce
that knowledge over time

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and it will inform
the next creation.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling me
too that not only do I

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.390 align:middle line:84%
need to remember who I am,
but I need to wake up people.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I need to tell
them that they need

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to remember who they
are, why they're here,

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and to prepare to transcend.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's the nuts and bolts.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
that we were coming

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.242 align:middle line:84%
to the end of a cycle
of birth and rebirth.

00:32:07.242 --> 00:32:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did they give you
like a time frame of this

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:90%
transcendence?

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: They didn't then,
but they have since then.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Before I left they
told me that I

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:84%
would be able to communicate
with them at any time now.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
That all I had to
do was reach out.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:84%
If I set the intention
to communicate,

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.160 align:middle line:84%
that they would know and
they would communicate back.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were you aware of
them putting any type of implant

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:84%
in you, or any other artificial
intelligence or any devices?

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I'm not
aware of anything.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I was
out of my body.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It was below me, so I
had no physical sensation

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.000 align:middle line:84%
However, I had
sensation, and it was

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:84%
like warmth and healing and
love and compassion, very, very

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.680 align:middle line:90%
old wisdom.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.155 align:middle line:84%
It was quite an
emotional experience.

00:32:58.155 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: One question.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Before you went into
the cave, did you

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.940 align:middle line:84%
check the time, what
time you went in?

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you came out,
did you check the time?

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Was there missing time involved?

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: When I went
in, it was around 3 PM.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And my recollection is
that when I came out--

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't even gotten
to how that happened-- that it

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:90%
was approximately 9:00 PM.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did it feel like
you were gone for six hours?

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: No.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No?

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: No, it really didn't.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.950 align:middle line:90%
It didn't feel that way at all.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: OK, since you said
there was about six hours

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.510 align:middle line:90%
involved--

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's right.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --how did the
experience conclude?

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I was put back into
my body and I was lowered from

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
the table, and walked out of the
room and back down the hallway

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to the alcove that I had
originally stepped into.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And the only one with me was
the tiny grey droid and the same

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.920 align:middle line:90%
three tall whites--

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:90%
escorted me back to the alcove.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:10.139 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got to the alcove,
Brian stepped into the base.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:90%
He stepped through.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as he did, I mean I
have this amazing memory of him

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
stepping right to me, and
we're looking eye to eye.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:84%
And then in a blink,
we're standing

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.357 align:middle line:90%
under that arch in his home.

00:34:24.357 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, in his home?

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.089 align:middle line:90%
Not inside the cave system?

00:34:28.089 --> 00:34:28.889 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: No.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.583 align:middle line:84%
They literally moved
us, physically moved us.

00:34:31.583 --> 00:34:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like he
said at the beginning,

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:90%
this is where I come out.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's right.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't kidding.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.429 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think you
were chosen for this meeting?

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I think it's because
I've had a life-long contact

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:52.290 align:middle line:84%
relationship that has laid the
groundwork for me to be able

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:84%
They have actually
told me that--

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:90%
I have been in a craft.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child,
I was in a craft.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And they told me,
at that time, when

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I was playing with other
children who didn't quite

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.975 align:middle line:84%
look like they-- they
didn't quite look human,

00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:90%
but they were all humanoid.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.750 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have hair.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Very friendly,
very fun, they were

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:84%
quite interested in my skin and
my clothes that I was wearing,

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and my hair.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:90%
There was lots of giggling.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:84%
There were three what
I would consider adults

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.220 align:middle line:84%
who were in the
room, who said to me,

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:84%
these are your
brothers and sisters.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't pass for
human, but you did,

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we put your
consciousness in this body.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
These were all other
consciousnesses

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.120 align:middle line:84%
that they ended up putting
in there because they

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:90%
didn't pass for human.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And they needed a particular
consciousness in human form

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that could pass and
do what I'm doing.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Añjali, do you know--

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I worked in DIA as
you worked in DIA.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you know of a special
investigative unit

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.750 align:middle line:84%
within the Defense
Intelligence Agency?

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.415 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: No.

00:36:02.415 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Do you know
that within that branch,

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:09.510 align:middle line:84%
there's a team of investigators
that investigate abductions?

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Oh, fantastic.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.745 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:11.745 --> 00:36:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Did you know that?

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: No, this is all new.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: OK, and their job
is to go out and interview

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:25.290 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes interrogate
people who claim to have had

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:90%
an abduction experience.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Sure.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: OK.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:31.130 align:middle line:84%
You made a presentation
in Washington DC.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's right.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.505 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Sometime after that,
you were interviewed by two

00:36:34.505 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:84%
people who claimed to be press
people or are journalists.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
two interview-- a man

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and a woman who
interviewed you regarding

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:90%
the statements that you made?

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But they were primarily
interested in Brian,

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:90%
those people?

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Yes.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.343 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Do you remember
what you told them?

00:36:53.343 --> 00:36:55.278 align:middle line:84%
You remember the interview
that you gave them?

00:36:55.278 --> 00:36:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I mean, I remember
giving them an interview.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that everything
I said was pretty much in line

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:90%
with now.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: At any time did you
feel that they weren't who they

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.367 align:middle line:90%
claim to be?

00:37:05.367 --> 00:37:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: You mean human?

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: No, no, no.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence officers.

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You being an
intelligence officer,

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.530 align:middle line:84%
you could detect
certain questions

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
that you were being somewhat
either wittingly or unwittingly

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:19.680 align:middle line:90%
interrogated.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: I didn't care.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: You didn't care.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.925 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Because
that was my mission.

00:37:23.925 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:10%
I didn't go to the
Lincoln Memorial

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:10%
and release this information
not to get that attention.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that was my
intention-- to make sure

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:10%
that those who were looking at
this, looking at the phenomena,

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.342 align:middle line:10%
would know what has happened
and what they're saying,

00:37:46.342 --> 00:37:47.800 align:middle line:10%
what these beings
are saying to me.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But your natural
reaction, since, number one,

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.260 align:middle line:84%
you had a security
clearance in the Air Force,

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.960 align:middle line:84%
you had a security clearance
within the Defense Intelligence

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Agency, didn't you expect
something like that to occur?

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: Well, I expect
it all the time, see.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I expect it from you.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't if you're working.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:90%
I just assume you are.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't matter
to me because what

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:84%
you do doesn't change
what I need to do.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So what they do doesn't
change what I need to do.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to continue
doing what I'm doing.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
very clear that I

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:84%
am willing to give interviews
and statements to anyone

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:90%
who wants to come and take it.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:90%
So I'm OK with that.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: If what you said
didn't hold any credence with

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
the government,
not just the DIA,

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:45.220 align:middle line:84%
but the other alphabet soup
agencies within a government,

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have went to the
means they did to investigate

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So what you say
and your statements

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.140 align:middle line:84%
you made at the Lincoln
Memorial and beyond,

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.260 align:middle line:84%
must hold some validation
with the government.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I've been told that
several times now from other

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:84%
people who are actively
working in intelligence,

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:90%
that this matches other sources.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So I am aware and I
welcome any opportunity

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to talk with anyone because
this is an issue for humanity.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.430 align:middle line:90%
It can't be kept from anyone.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: It was a
validation for your story.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: That's nice.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --it's an interest
within the government.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.150 align:middle line:84%
You make a statement like
that, if there wasn't anything

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to back it up or any background
or any historical past

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.748 align:middle line:84%
incidents of that nature,
they wouldn't have cared,

00:39:38.748 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't have done--

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have spent time
or money investigating you.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.065 align:middle line:84%
So you validated your
story right there.

00:39:45.065 --> 00:39:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Thank you.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Añjali, that
was a fascinating story.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to do
more episodes with you.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming on the show.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>> AÑJALI: Thank you so much.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Thank you.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And Richard, it's
always a pleasure having you

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:90%
on the show.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Great to
be here, Emery.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.585 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith,
and this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:40:01.585 --> 00:40:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> AÑJALI: I was asleep in
my bed, and then suddenly,

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.530 align:middle line:90%
I was in a craft.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:17.400 align:middle line:90%
There were small children.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:90%
They looked pretty human.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I instantly
thought, oh, my God,

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.860 align:middle line:84%
she went to the grey
school for gifted kids.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.940 align:middle line:84%
We know about well,
at least, dozens

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of species that have their own
hybridization program on Earth.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I know personally,
from the Reagan era,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I was very concerned about
whether an ET could infiltrate

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:90%
American society.
