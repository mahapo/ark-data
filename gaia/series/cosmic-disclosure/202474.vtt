00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:10%
we are with David Adair--

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:10%
space technology
transfer consultant,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:10%
US Navy jet engine
technician, field researcher

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
for the Office of Naval
Intelligence, and so much more.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.965 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome to the show

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Yeah,
thank you for having me.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.798 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In early "Cosmic
Disclosure" episodes,

00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
you have talked about
ET technologies.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us
a little bit more

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
about what these
technologies are?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And how do they work?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: One of the best ways
to define that technology people

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
can relate to, being that you
don't have a spacecraft sitting

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:90%
in your backyard--

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:90%
what people observe--

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:90%
UFOs.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the most common
thing I can think of.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say they
blink out, and then

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:90%
blink over here and blink.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Actually, they're not blinking.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:90%
They're moving.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But they're moving so
fast, you can't see it.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:84%
They're going from
point A to point B.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But the space that's
between them--

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.152 align:middle line:84%
they're not really
passing through that.

00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:21.485 align:middle line:84%
They're only passing through
a very small portion of it,

00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
because they have wound
that space to them.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And they jump over it,
and they blink over here.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:84%
When they blink
off, the blink-on

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
is they've already
made the transition.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And they've moved over.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, from horizon
to horizon, you're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:90%
not talking that many miles.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, it could be
a thousand miles.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But on a space level, you need
to travel billions of miles.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
That blinking would
be a real handy thing.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could jump
entire quadrants of space

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:90%
in just seconds.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And they can do that.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Because one drive
that I've worked

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
on that I know that
works in my possession

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
is that when you get this
sphere built and stabilized--

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and, boy, that's the
keyword-- stabilize.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Once you get this
magnetic field stabilized,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
you can detonate a chain
reaction inside it, an H-bomb

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:90%
and contain it.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And people say nothing can
contain a fury of an H-bomb

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:90%
inside a--

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:90%
no, it's not material.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's electromagnetic fields
at such an intense level

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.228 align:middle line:84%
that even a nuclear chain
reaction will put a dent in it.

00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be sitting there,
go, there's no such thing.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.825 align:middle line:90%
That's been impossible.

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you think
a black hole does?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It pulls up to a sun.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And what's the sun?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Millions of hydrogen
bombs going off,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
continuously, simultaneously
all across the planet.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's burning the
fuel out of the planet.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying to
explode outward.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
The gravity mass of the
sun is pulling it back in.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So it blows out,
pulls in, blows it

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
until it's stabilized
near the burning sun.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
A black hole can pull
up next to that thing,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
suck it into its event
horizon, the opening.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And that sun disappears.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking-- you could
pour a 100 million Earths

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
inside one of these suns.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And the sun just goes down.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
The event horizon is gone
forever, never seen again.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.785 align:middle line:90%
We only have theories.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you can contain that
energy, is what you're saying?

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It is.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And can you
also extract the energy

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:90%
when you need it?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a tricky point.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, you got this fury in there.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to bust the
balloon, the containment field.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Or it's going to be really
uncomfortable for everybody.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's a way of
channeling, extracting

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
through a plasma beam that
runs down through the cord

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
line of the sail.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
to a focal point,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
you can use a laser to
orifice the diameter.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you can get
down to the diameter

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.415 align:middle line:84%
smaller than a human hair, which
is about where you want to be.

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
want to open up

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
too much of a hole with the
fury of an entire sun roaring

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Because on Newtonian physics--

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.635 align:middle line:84%
when it goes out that exit, you
got a opposite, equal reaction.

00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:90%
So you can see it could be--

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:84%
you got-- measurement and
containment is very tricky.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
it contained right,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
there are several ways
you can use the energy.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
This thing that I've
built wasn't even--

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get to phase one.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:90%
I got halfway to phase one.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:90%
I got the field to contain.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.357 align:middle line:90%
And then they took it.

00:05:04.357 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who's they?

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, they would
be the United States Air

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Force, the CIA, whoever else
is in that god-awful alphabet

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
soup.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But what they wanted
with that is the speed

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:84%
on a Newtonian physics
plane from point A

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
to point B on a linear focus.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: David, where
did you get this from?

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I learned it from
the engine and the math.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
When I'm doing it, see--
and this kind of math--

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
this is not like you're
multiplying, adding,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:90%
subtracting, dividing.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:84%
This is quantum physics
differential mechanics.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's on a level where
if you're lucky enough

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and you got enough brain
cells, you can follow the math.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't lead
the math anywhere.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.700 align:middle line:90%
It leads you.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
So I was following the math.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And some things
started showing up.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.332 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, god, there's
spin-offs in this thing.

00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even think about it.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.415 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying to
get a containment field.

00:06:04.415 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, what kind of spin-off
would be worth anything?

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, on the math, once
the field is contained,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:90%
I noticed something.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And the set of algorithms
and math was showing me.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.548 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, oh, my god.

00:06:19.548 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.885 align:middle line:90%
I made fun with them.

00:06:22.885 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%
"Back to the Future."

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.118 align:middle line:90%
It's a flux capacitor.

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's a flux capacitor.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No, it's
an inertia dampener.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:90%
What's so exciting about that?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Let me get Bugs Bunny
to help me explain this.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when we were
kids and watching cartoons?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Bugs is in there
playing with his friend.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
He ran out of gas and
has fallen back to Earth.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The speedometer is
running off the dials.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:90%
The wings rip off.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.255 align:middle line:90%
He's just in a dart.

00:06:48.255 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're all screaming
they're all going to die.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, they are.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:90%
They're on impact.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.308 align:middle line:84%
And right before it
hits, Bugs opens the door

00:06:54.308 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and takes all his friends,
and sets them outside,

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:90%
and the plane crashes.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a cartoon.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:90%
That's reality.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:90%
That can happen.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen through
an inertia dampener

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:90%
from this device.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Because what it can do--

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
it has the ability to shield
off all the Newtonian forces

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
we have to deal with.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, are you in your
own electromagnetic field?

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The field
is in its own field.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:90%
It's in its own.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's a
field inside a field.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Here, let's answer
this question.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Here comes a UFO
5,000 miles an hour.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It does a 90-degree corner.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.232 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He's in his own field.

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, what
was ever in there,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.135 align:middle line:84%
would do that, if it's
organic, it's going to be soup.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
going to be left.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be just
smashed into obliteration

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
from the g-forces
that's involved.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
However, with inertia
dampener, like I found on mine,

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:90%
you have a secondary field.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Primary field, phase one,
holds the engine power.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Secondary field can either
go outside the spacecraft

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:90%
or go up to the cockpit.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
You put a secondary
field around a cockpit.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the good of that?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
They feel no momentum, no
inertia, no kinetics, nothing.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.150 align:middle line:90%
All Newtonian physics erased.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
5,000 miles an hour,
90-degree corner, and they

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:90%
don't even feel it.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way they
could be doing that.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, when you
see a craft doing that,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that's an electromagnetic
fusion containment device,

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:84%
or it's something
awful similar to it.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But you got to have that
with these secondary fields.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought inertia
dampener was something

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.607 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't even looking for.

00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you saying you
built an anti-gravity device

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:90%
that actually works?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's not truly
an anti-gravity device,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:84%
not the way the other
people have been going at.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:90%
This thing is just--

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:84%
it's an echo field of the
original containment field.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But inside that secondary field,
I have removed all inertia.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:20.077 align:middle line:84%
So that's really cool, because I
wasn't expecting it to do that.

00:09:20.077 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And what is that field?

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.122 align:middle line:84%
What would you
classify that field as?

00:09:25.122 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: An inertia dampener.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.837 align:middle line:90%
That would be its name.

00:09:27.837 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what it does.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It stops all of the motions
of Newtonian physics,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
kinetic energy,
inertia, momentum.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What type of energy
are we looking at, David,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:90%
to power that?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Way I got
to it was once you

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:84%
get the magnetic field
sustained, then you detonate

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
a nuclear chain reaction, which
I used two different isotopes

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
to get that annihilation
effect, which that was always

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:90%
an interesting moment.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm sure.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I didn't want
to tell people around me,

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
if this don't work, us
and about half this state

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:90%
is going to be gone.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't bother telling
anybody, but we had no mishaps.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was pretty
sure of the math.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the ability to
jump, that this thing can do,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:90%
that was more than I expected.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
What they wanted from me
was a propulsion unit.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted
to go really fast.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for a
first-strike nuclear weapon.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, on the very first
prototype that we launched out

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:84%
of White Sands, that guy covered
125 miles in 3.2 seconds,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But imagine something covering
125 miles in 3 seconds.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Think that'd make a good
first-strike weapon?

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they saw that
and they wanted it--

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's instant.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So they took the engine
design, me, and everything.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's all they wanted.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking a shower
with a raincoat on.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole lot you're
missing, a whole lot of this.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:84%
This is only one
half of one phase,

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:90%
and there are four phases.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The second phase
gets really good.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
That's where we'll start
picking up the inertia dampener.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.327 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
phase is when we're--

00:11:31.327 --> 00:11:33.493 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, that was without
the inertial dampener?

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.013 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And you
were going that fast?

00:11:36.013 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.895 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's what happens
in this kind of speeds

00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:90%
and containments.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And the
device did not shred?

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Tell you what it did do.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:90%
It got hot.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:84%
See, when something coming in
reentry at 5,000 miles an hour,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:90%
this thing was that hot leaving.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Ascension.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It was that hot.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
The air couldn't get
out the way fast enough.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that was red
hot on the way out.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot cooler coming back
in, because you use parachutes.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But I knew it was going
to pick up air friction,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't know how much.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It looked like-- when
it was leaving the pad,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
it just looked like a streak
of metal being shot into space.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:90%
You didn't even see it.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And, boy, sure felt it.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is a point where
everybody misses something.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:90%
And I have a question about it.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you like to know
what a electromagnetic fusion

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.320 align:middle line:90%
contained engine sounds like?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Indeed.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Nobody has ever heard
the sound of this engine,

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
except for me and a handful
of people at White Sands.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's it sound like?

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It is like--

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:84%
think of the highest shrieking
soprano you've ever heard.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like it screamed,
like a scream on the way out.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are UFOs and
extraterrestrial vehicles

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:90%
utilizing that technology?

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: A form of
that technology.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I'm in a
rocket, so I'm a tube.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Off you go.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:90%
An arrow.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:90%
They're circular.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
They're a sphere.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:90%
They're circular.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to work
much easier for them,

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:90%
because they are circular.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That'll become their
containment fields.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It'd be the most logical
engine right in the center,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:90%
because everything is circular.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
The internal fields,
the external fields,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
everything is following a
similar proportion called

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:90%
the Mobius of the design.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So a UFO would have
this thing humming.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see this light
glow, or you hear it sometimes.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
They say people hear humming
or they feel something.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.521 align:middle line:90%
Because, man, this thing is--

00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:90%
it's idling at light speed.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It's something like,
where's your vehicle?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Sitting over there.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.978 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's idling.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but it's idling
at light speed.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't even calculate
it into horsepower.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: This can't be done.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You have the power of a sun set
in there, and it's contained.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.715 align:middle line:84%
But when you draw
on that power, there

00:14:23.715 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
are so many different
ways to go with this.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
gets interesting.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I chose the electromagnetic
fusion containment route.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Because they can control
it better and easier.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And I understand enough of
it through Newtonian physics.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But what if they changed it
where they run on frequencies?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
What if they lock on to some
kind of frequency on a planet

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.385 align:middle line:84%
and they use vectors that they
fly from planet to planet?

00:14:48.385 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:84%
They could have all kinds
of things stuck in there.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, even the
fact of time travel.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many scientists
postulate that these craft

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:90%
are us from the future.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's some sort of time
travel involved with that.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're going at those
speeds leaving our system

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
or coming back and forth,
what do you think about that?

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You're going to
have a hard time seeing

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
where you're going, 'cause you
outrun your own headlights.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:90%
There's the time travel effect.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Man, that's another
world in itself.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But with this type of
technology I'm talking about,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
you have the power
to warp space.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
power to warp time.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And time manipulation
with this thing--

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
you would have both
time and distance.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.773 align:middle line:84%
And if you control
those two, there's

00:15:43.773 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:84%
no where in the
universe you can't

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:84%
go in just relative short
time, relative time where

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to take 200
million years to get over

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll be there in two minutes.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And that would be capable.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:90%
But I can only imagine from--

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:90%
here I got a--

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because you come back
at the same time that you left.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you're getting
in time motion continuum.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be the
first to tell you,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the brightest
bulb in the box here.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a very difficult
concept to tackle.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
In a realistic 3D world,
most of my colleagues

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't even entertain the
thoughts of it, it being real.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.325 align:middle line:84%
I, at least, will try
to postulate how you

00:16:30.325 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:90%
would do some of this stuff.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But we've got so many missing
items that we don't know.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:90%
No, of course.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about
what's going on in the news

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and what people are
saying out there

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.020 align:middle line:84%
about these unidentified
aerial phenomena?

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We've seen some videos
now on the news.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:90%
People are talking about that.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's us or
is it extraterrestrial?

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I think it's both.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Some of the things I've seen--

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:90%
it hasn't been too many.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:90%
But I saw one device--

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:90%
two of them, actually.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:90%
They were flying.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was just sheer
luck that I caught them.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I was laying back against
this pool and was in the pool.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And the sun just dropped
behind the building.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the entire
sun ball was blocked,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
but you can see the
corona perfectly.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, I thought, oh, wow.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
You can see the sun's corona
without being blinded.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
As soon I said that,
coming into the corona,

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
you see something
forming up into a solid.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's behind is
still transparent.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
As it moves on into the
corona, it finishes out,

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:90%
soliding up into a visual.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
a flying arrowhead

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:90%
with the little bumps.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And then it took off in
about two seconds later.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Another one just below it came
right in, did the same thing.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.503 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes out of the
corona, it starts disappearing.

00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And when it's out of the corona,
you can't see it anymore.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.777 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:18:04.777 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Where I was lying and
where those two things

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
were heading in that
direction-- they

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:90%
were headed straight to Area 51.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:90%
I believe that was us.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that was us in
some kind of backward

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
reverse-engineered
technology, whatever.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was just sheer luck I
caught it in the sun's corona.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
remember what I saw.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.112 align:middle line:84%
And they looked like
flying arrowheads.

00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I was just
looking on the internet.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.445 align:middle line:90%
And there was a photograph.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:38.463 align:middle line:84%
Somebody shot a film
outside of the plane.

00:18:38.463 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And the things
weren't horizontal.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:90%
They were vertical.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was four
or five of them.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's the same thing I saw.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I remembered the bumps.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.515 align:middle line:84%
But, boy, these
things were fast.

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
They're using a linear
propulsion system,

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
because they had little
blank pods on the side.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:90%
And you see a little flame.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're gone and so fast,
you can't even see them.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But that's a linear
propulsion device.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So I would think that you
would have several propulsion

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:90%
devices on ships like this.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
You get one that you
use out in deep space.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's your big
primary engines.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And you crank up
and you're gone--

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
wrap space around yourself, jump
through dimensions, whatever.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:84%
When you get into a planet, you
use the scaled back version.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But their scaled
back version still--

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:90%
god, centuries ahead of us.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In your own
mind, what do you

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:90%
believe those craft were?

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Were they ours?

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Were they extraterrestrial?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.166 align:middle line:84%
Are these alien
reproduction vehicles?

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I think it's C--

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:90%
all the above.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.905 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.905 --> 00:19:51.905 align:middle line:90%
Some of these vehicles--

00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I could tell they're linear
propulsion with a cloaking

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
our technology.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It's been reversed.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.900 align:middle line:90%
We've stoled it or whatever.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Traded it off for
something else.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a level that moves
outside Newtonian physics.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
That's more along my engine
or some other similar engines.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there's others that
are moving with something

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
where to start with.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And that would be your
extraterrestrial technologies.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're handicapped,
because I'm

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
working with an encyclopedia
set with this many volumes.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And the encyclopedia
set might be from here

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
to the wall in volumes,
the ones I don't have.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And scientists there
take me sometimes.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
They're so smart, and they can
be so limited at the same time.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
They'll look and tell
me the atomic code.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
The atomic code chart
we got-- that's it

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:90%
for the entire universe.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, son, you couldn't be
more wrong if you had to be.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I said that might be 1% of
what's going on out there.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.440 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
We're so far back here in the
back waters of the galaxy,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.435 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what's going
on out there in the center,

00:21:12.435 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:90%
the hub activity.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And they may have hundreds--

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.560 align:middle line:84%
forms of energy that
we don't even have.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
NASA always seems
to have the hots

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:90%
for action-reaction vehicles.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And they got 73
of those designs.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.510 align:middle line:90%
We've only seen two--

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
liquid fuel and
solid propellant.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's all these others
to pick from, so we don't know.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are the black
holes used for space

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
travel amongst the
extraterrestrial civilizations?

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: In our technology, no.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:90%
But in theirs-- could be.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
That would be really
a good choice.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, we
have black holes

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:90%
on our side of the galaxy.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And we see matter going
into it all the time,

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:90%
just suck up a sun or planet.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And where does it go?

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, old Hawkins--
he had a good idea.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:84%
He said everything
that's consumed

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:84%
on this end in our galaxy
into a black hole--

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
it goes down through
the singularity.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And it spits out at the
other end of the galaxy.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:84%
All that matter comes
spewing out, out of a--

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:90%
what is known as a quasar.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have quasars
over here on our side.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So what he's saying is these
black hole tunnels on one end

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:84%
will be a black
hole, second end.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And on the other end
of the same tunnel

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:90%
would be a quasar spewing out.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And we got quasars we
watch all the time.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:90%
The matter just keeps coming.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:10%
I mean, matters that make up--

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:10%
you can build entire
planets with it.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It's continuous.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:90%
It never stops.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.885 align:middle line:90%
Where is this coming from?

00:22:56.885 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Could be a black hole
on the other end of it,

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:90%
sucking it in over there.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you could
time it where you

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:84%
could run through
these things, then you

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:90%
got the legendary stargate.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:90%
You're using wormhole travel.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is these
things are very unstable.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
They break down and
collapse, move around.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know where
they're going to show up next.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.340 align:middle line:90%
That's where mine was handy.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when you deal
with mine, you build it.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's stationary.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It's stable.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So you always know where
your black hole is.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:90%
You're controlling it.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose I never let mine
get loose for obvious reasons.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:45.346 align:middle line:84%
But mine would be compared
to a mini black hole.

00:23:45.346 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not-- if
it didn't have an event,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:84%
the horizon would have
swallowed a whole sun or planet.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it
couldn't swallow Earth?

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, actually, it could.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.213 align:middle line:90%
What about the solar system?

00:23:58.213 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It depends
when it stops.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:90%
It could just keep going.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.430 align:middle line:90%
It could be bad news.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You going to put an on
and off switch on that, Dave?

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.315 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Not on that thing.

00:24:05.315 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But if the way
the math tells me,

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to run renegade
and suck the Earth into it

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:90%
if the fields--

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.605 align:middle line:84%
I have the fields set up
in a fail-safe position.

00:24:18.605 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
familiar with that,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:84%
our nuclear weapons
have a fail-safe.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
I have a way for this
thing to disconnect

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:90%
beyond the speed of light.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:90%
It's in quarks.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And he also referred
to it as tachyons.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Tachyons.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah--

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, the tachyons.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.658 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --one of the
smallest particles.

00:24:37.658 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, so my
switch is a tachyon

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:84%
switch faster than
the speed of light.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Because, believe me, you
want to get before anybody

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:90%
starts its thing.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that won't
be a fun event.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be next to a
mini black hole if it goes off.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It might say the word many.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:90%
It's anything but many in power.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:90%
How do tachyons neutralize that?

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we're being
bombarded with them daily.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:84%
They're such a small particle
going right through us,

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:90%
right now as we talk.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:90%
See, the way we deal with--

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.150 align:middle line:84%
you get in an area
called quantum mechanics.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And people use
those terms so much

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:90%
at some of these conventions.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, goodness.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: People--
you're just so far off.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- look
at the word quantum.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Small.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.495 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know how small I'm
talking about when I say small.

00:25:31.495 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I know.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So this is
a little lengthy.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But, boy, it's
interesting stuff.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:84%
People use these
terms all the time,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:84%
but you all just don't
quite get it right.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.705 align:middle line:90%
How did the black hole form?

00:25:49.705 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a good question.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:90%
The way a black hole is formed--

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
you have-- let's
start off with suns.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You have a blue giant, a yellow
medium star, and a red dwarf,

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Our sun is a yellow medium star.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Blue giants-- you got
to see that thing.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
You could pour 100 million
suns into one of these.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So across the face
of a medium sun,

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
across the United States
about 3,000 miles.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, across the
face of our sun,

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:36.850 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at over
500,000 miles, a half

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:90%
a million miles across its face.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty big, considering
the Earth is only what?

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.570 align:middle line:84%
32,000 in cumference,
8,000 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So you got a half
a million mile--

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.672 align:middle line:84%
so imagine the mass, how
much that thing weighs.

00:26:54.672 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's stabilized,
because it's

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.610 align:middle line:84%
blowing out where the gravity
is pulling it back in.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.079 align:middle line:90%
It's stabilized.

00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:90%
But gravity always wins.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.570 align:middle line:84%
When the fuel burns out,
it starts collapsing.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.165 align:middle line:90%
And it'll collapse.

00:27:10.165 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:90%
It's shrinking in.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
The gravity mass is
pulling it all into itself.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's down the
size of a basketball.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But here, it's a
mind-boggling thing.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Same mass.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It weighs as
much as it did when it was

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:90%
a half a million miles across.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Exactly.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Now, imagine how
heavy that basketball is.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So you take it on down
to the size of a marble,

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:84%
still weighs as much as it did
a half million miles across.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:90%
That marble is so heavy.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
If you let it go, it'd go
clear through this Earth.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
The gravity field
will pull it back.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And it'd keep going until
it shred this Earth,

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:84%
till the Earth looked like it
went through a paper shredder.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's quantum physics,
but we're not through.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:84%
This is where the physicists
just get up and walk out.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:90%
It's going to get smaller.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get down to a
BB, down to a grain of sand.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes down until
you can't even see it.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets to a point
where it can't be seen anymore,

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that's when it becomes the most
powerful thing in the universe.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:90%
It's now a black hole.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:90%
And what it's doing--

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:90%
it has--

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Smaller than a tachyon?

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, let
me take that table size.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's take an atom.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And we cut into the atom.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And we get out the electrons,
protons, neutrons, all out

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.090 align:middle line:90%
of the way.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.088 align:middle line:90%
Got the nucleus.

00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's cut in the nucleus.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And we go in there.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:90%
What do you find?

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Quarks.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a quark, and
cut it, and go inside that.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:90%
What's inside the quark?

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Strings.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't been able to
go any further, past a string.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.710 align:middle line:90%
We think that's it.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
string theory starts,

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:90%
which explains everything.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein--
his favorite thing

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to do when he was just standing
around thinking-- remember,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:04.710 align:middle line:90%
he had a violin.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:84%
He was a violin player,
strings right under his chin.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And subconsciously, he knew.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
That violin-- he was
on the right track.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So now, we got
all that going on.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:23.685 align:middle line:84%
So when it gets so small
where it don't exist anymore,

00:29:23.685 --> 00:29:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that's when the physicists leave
and the quantum physics people

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:90%
come in.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics
people-- oh, OK.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
We're now in a singularity state
where we have event horizon.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:90%
We have a long tube.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.003 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what's
on the other end.

00:29:36.003 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:90%
We think it's a quasar.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:90%
So this thing now forms.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:90%
It's floating through space.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a rubber band.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:84%
You pull it and let
it go, and it snaps.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And when it stops wiggling,
that's where it's at.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- they're all
over the place out there.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:84%
If I've been talking to
you for an hour, you,

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.050 align:middle line:84%
your home you're just
watching this in,

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the town that your home is
in, the state, the country,

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the planet has moved 100,000
miles through space linear.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So what if the
planet, just one day,

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
crosses the path of
a mini black hole?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:90%
We think that's happened.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
There was a case of this
lady and her daughter

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:90%
in a poorhouse.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:90%
This bright light showed up.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And she's in a
stand-alone house.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Her little girl walks
into the bright light

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.735 align:middle line:90%
going, look at how pretty.

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And any mother is going
to dive after her child.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:90%
She grabs her.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
to the other side,

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
they're standing
in a dormitory room

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Toronto, Canada,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:84%
from Chicago to
Toronto in one second.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:90%
The students who were studying--

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:90%
well, they called the police.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:90%
They arrest the poor woman.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:90%
So they listened to her story.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And they said they
started tracking

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
buses and planes,
trains, any way she could

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:90%
have called it-- arrived there.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.442 align:middle line:90%
They found nothing.

00:31:16.442 --> 00:31:18.150 align:middle line:84%
They went and canvassed
the neighborhood.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbors
saw, within the hour,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.810 align:middle line:84%
she was right
there in her house.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.150 align:middle line:84%
The neighbors swear to
God that she was there.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:90%
I just talked to her.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Seconds later, she's
in Toronto, Canada.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, you got to
research the story.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And you find out the house is
no longer there, just a slab.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.875 align:middle line:84%
Big chain-link
fence around it and

00:31:40.875 --> 00:31:43.813 align:middle line:84%
says, "Property of the
United States Government."

00:31:43.813 --> 00:31:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And the woman is gone.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:90%
The child is gone.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't know anything.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Probably witness
protection plan.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think she
hit a black hole.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:84%
She's damn lucky she
didn't step into a sun

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.428 align:middle line:84%
or on another planet
with no atmosphere.

00:31:59.428 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Her and her daughter wouldn't
have done too well there.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did she just appear
in front of the students?

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yep, bright light.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.438 align:middle line:90%
And there she is.

00:32:08.438 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
That was the other
end of the tunnel.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, it was very small.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And Earth probably
passed through it.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
We have heard over and over
of people disappearing right

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:90%
in front of people.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that could be
these translucent wormholes

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:29.107 align:middle line:84%
that we fly through with
the Earth, hits the person

00:32:29.107 --> 00:32:30.190 align:middle line:90%
just at the right moment--

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right moment there.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --in time
and they're gone.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And we think they may have
went to another dimension.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Possible.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The wormholes may travel
through dimensions.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a
way that a craft could

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.910 align:middle line:84%
be made to project these
black holes in order

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.980 align:middle line:90%
to travel through?

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I've been knocking on the door.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Could imagine what a big
institution with billions

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of dollars could
move on through.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I know where I could get in
and push them on through.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:90%
But, absolutely.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.800 align:middle line:90%
You could have craft designed.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.280 align:middle line:84%
It's built for nothing
but time travel.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have
a craft designed

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:84%
where it's built for nothing
but really long-distance galaxy

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:90%
jumpers.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And if we do
have this technology,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why is it still
being kept secret, David?

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, I
thought about that.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I can't be
the smartest person

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:90%
there is and figured this out.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:90%
There's other people.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Either
they've been suppressed

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:90%
or they've been enticed.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.740 align:middle line:84%
They will offer
carrots or a stick,

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.680 align:middle line:90%
whichever works the best.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:48.343 align:middle line:84%
But I think the technology has
been restricted and controlled.

00:33:48.343 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you've
just seen other things

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:90%
building out of this stuff.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in my own world
and kept my own containment.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I've never been a threat,
just the fact that I exist.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm like a piece
of sticky tape.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't get it off of you.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm just still here, been
doing this over 50 years.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still here.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've been
visited by them.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And, Mr. Smith, what
are you doing here?

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.650 align:middle line:84%
You better not teach
anyone about it.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We know what you're doing.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't share it with anyone.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't hook it up to the
grid, because we're watching.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just
a little threat.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.088 align:middle line:84%
But we still need you for
something else later on.

00:34:37.088 --> 00:34:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, I
don't even get that.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.590 align:middle line:90%
I just get phone calls.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.449 align:middle line:84%
Will you help us with
this thing over here?

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:42.249 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Great.

00:34:42.249 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And I go, OK.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
But I've always been
a good little sailor

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:90%
and kept my self contained.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:84%
They also don't want
to lose track of me.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If I want to
go visit some country,

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.603 align:middle line:84%
you ought to see
what happens with it.

00:34:58.603 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You're an asset.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, man.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.250 align:middle line:90%
All this stuff.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Flags came up everywhere.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, if
we have this ability

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.550 align:middle line:84%
to create craft using
anti-gravity propulsion, how

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.100 align:middle line:84%
do you see that changing
the world, if anything?

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: God,
that'd be like 1860.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.732 align:middle line:84%
And I walk up to
you and go, hey,

00:35:18.732 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:90%
we just invented electricity.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.833 align:middle line:84%
You think that's going
to change anything?

00:35:21.833 --> 00:35:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Everything changes.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Everything will change.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:84%
This technology would
be so unbelievable.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And it would start
chain reactions

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of other technologies.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where do you see us in
the future with this technology

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:90%
going mainstream?

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If we
could get this out

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and we could go mainstream,
Roddenberry, "Star Trek."

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:90%
That's where we'd be.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere-- one of those
planets in "Star Wars."

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
We would have all
kinds of capabilities.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
down that road,

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
so many things coming.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
People want to trade with you.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I got these
funny-looking rocks over here.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.467 align:middle line:84%
Well, they call them
dilithium crystals.

00:36:04.467 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
See if you can do
something with it.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Something like
that would happen.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything would change.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you what
would really change--

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:90%
the medical world.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
That would be one of the
biggest changes of them all.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And you could do that simply
by building a space hospital.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And what would be next
door to the space hospital?

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Space pharmaceutical
manufacturing plant.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.230 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceuticals that
could be made out there

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:90%
is unimaginable.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten glimpses of it.

>>EMERY: David, thank you so
much for being on the show.
