>> Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor
to covert analyst,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:10%
trying to understand the
missions and strategies

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:10%
of non-human intelligences
on our planet.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Tim.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, you talked about
humans that don't have souls.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.095 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what does that mean?

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what does it mean?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, we
have certain types

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of entities on this
planet, which is basically,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:90%
biological humans.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We have hybrids on
this planet as well.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:84%
We have incarnated,
reincarnated souls

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that basically are no
different to any other human.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we
also have something

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:84%
which is called non-soul
human, which are basically,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
biological humans that
the universe put here,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
but they haven't
had the experience

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:90%
of creating their own souls.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what happens is
that every consciousness unit,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
which means observer
or whatever, person,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call it,
goes through certain stages.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And once an animal or
a human or whatever

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
comes to a point
of self-awareness,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:84%
in that very moment, a
soul is being created.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So basically, once
someone reaches

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.060 align:middle line:84%
the stage of I awareness,
I am this, I am that,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
a soul container gets created
and stores all the energy

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and all the experiences
that someone

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:90%
makes in their lifetime.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And through several
lifetimes, they all

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:84%
get stored in this
soul container.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
what is missing

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
to some humans on this planet,
as well to some animals too.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And how many of these
non-soul beings are

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:90%
on the planet?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> That is a good
question, Emery.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's easy
to find an answer to that.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So one might think that it
must be a very large number.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>> And how do we recognize them?

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost impossible to
differentiate them because what

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
they do is they are basically
empty vessels in that

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
definition, which means they
don't have an I awareness,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:90%
not yet.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
But they still act
as normal humans.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
But this happens because people
are projecting their own soul

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and their own
awareness into them.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So basically, as much
as certain animals

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that might behave
in a certain way,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
they do not reflect
their own behavior.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And they are more or less
guided through the field

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that has been created
through people

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
that already have a soul.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So what purpose
do they serve?

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what purpose?

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
They-- naturally, they do not
serve any purpose other than

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
filling the space, so to
speak, which makes this planet

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:90%
a little more--

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:90%
a little more full.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So basically, these
are background figures

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:90%
that appear somewhere.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And you get the impression that
there are a lot more humans

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:90%
on this planet than there are.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
This is basically one
function, which is

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:90%
a natural universal function.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And they also are
here to gain a soul.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So they're basically
making experiences as much

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:90%
as animals do.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you have a
dog and you call your dog

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
in a specific way,
and the dog realizes

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that it's him or her
that's being called,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that is the moment when an
animal develops an I awareness.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is the moment
when they create--

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
when they receive
a soul container.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they know through their
life that they don't have

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:90%
a soul?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Or do they come to some
awareness about any of that?

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.075 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they don't.

00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:90%
They don't actually know that.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They-- I've seen them react,
behave in a certain way,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and snap, and they
behave differently.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I know you had a story, some
personal experience you had

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting one.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And this has nothing to do
with the projects or something.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:84%
This was just a private
approach on making contact.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Last summer, we spent some
time in the German forests.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And we were a little
group of some people.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing this
meditation technique

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:90%
in order to get contact.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the people that
were with me was using

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.805 align:middle line:90%
a laser pointer in order to--

00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
as soon as we see something
so we can make contact.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what
happened then is

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere
forest, late at night,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and we basically started
this meditation practice

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
and calling in someone.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this
group of young people

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
were approaching us in
the middle of nowhere.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying
like, did you call us?

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And was it you with
the laser pointer?

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what we found out is
that we basically made contact

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:90%
with a different species.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And they used a
group of youngsters

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
that were hanging around there
and I don't know, get drunk

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they did.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was basically in
the middle of nowhere.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
But they used them and they
showed us how they did it.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
They used these young
people that were basically

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
empty, non-soul humans,
they used them in order

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:84%
to project their own awareness
and consciousness into them,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and then maneuver them around,
just like mechanics or just

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
like I don't know, like
a vehicle or something.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And they showed us and
explained that it's

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
like looking through
a window when

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
you look through their eyes,
and that you can maneuver them

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:84%
around, and that you could--
can make them talk so that we

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:90%
can have this conversation.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So basically, this went
on for a few minutes.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And until, unfortunately,
one person in my group

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
freaked out about this
conversation that we had.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
So she got scared by a lot.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And that scared the
group of people.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:90%
And they backed off.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:90%
And this came to an end.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But basically, they
were telling us

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that they are using
these non-soul humans

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
as empty vessels in order
to maneuver them around.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Who are the "they"
that you're referring to?

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So I have no name to them.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It was basically, we're doing
this contact meditation thing

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:90%
privately.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
introduced them

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:90%
as having heard our calling.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
respond and wanted

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:90%
to get in contact with us.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But they also felt like
some people in my group

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:90%
would react scared and fearful.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't appeared
in their actual form

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:84%
or sent a hologram or
something, but instead,

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
decided that they take on
one of those non-soul humans,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
a group of them, and
make them contact us.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it a temporary thing
when they take over the vessel?

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
And where are they?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it's a temporary thing.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:84%
You could basically take over
such person for basically ever

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:90%
until it dies.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But yes, they use it
as a temporal option

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:90%
to make contact.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Who were they?

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
They introduced themselves as
a non-terrestrial intelligence.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:84%
They did not talk
about if they are

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:90%
present in the 3D or whatever.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we had
this conversation

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:90%
with this group of young guys.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Where was their
consciousness before they came

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
into the vessel?

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> They explained to us that
they are basically somewhere

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
around the globe, on
the planet, basically.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know because
the whole conversation only

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
took like a few minutes
until one of our friends

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:90%
freaked out about it.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But it could, I think,
well be on a plane,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
but it could also be like in
a different realm of reality

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
or something, and then
projected it in those vessels.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But basically,
they told us, they

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
are around the globe somewhere,
and projecting themselves

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:90%
into that.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Into that person's body.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these non-soul humans
born or are they constructed?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Any type of animal.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Any type of life form.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It goes through certain
phases of consciousness.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So they are born on this planet
as a level 2 consciousness

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
being, which is basically
someone who eats, breathes,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and digests, but has
no clue about what

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:90%
he or she is in an I awareness.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly
enough, you can still

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:90%
have conversations with them.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:90%
But they are more like--

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
imagine you have a conversation
with someone in your dream.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically your
own consciousness that

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:90%
is guiding the conversation.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So they can still
give you answers.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And it appears like
you're talking to a human,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
but this is basically
your own projection,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
your own consciousness
energy that

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
takes over them and gives you
a responsiveness in that way.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they share the
oneness, Tim, like we do?

00:10:29.835 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
How we all say
that we're all one.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%
But are they one with us?

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they are.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are all
part of the same source

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and part of the same creation.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
They're just not that
much evolved and developed

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:90%
compared to other humans.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
You can help them
out in that way

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
as you can educate
them on being someone.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So basically-- and
this makes it super

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:84%
hard to differentiate
what is in front of you

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:84%
because they react to
the way you behave,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
the way you speak to them,
they will react on that.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And they can, over
time, learn what

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:90%
it means to be an I awareness.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
This should happen all
the time, unless there

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
are other forces that see
an advantage in having

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
these non-soul humans, and
keep them from developing,

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they being controlled by
some force or non-terrestrial

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:90%
being?

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that is a
controversial topic.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that
there is a huge interest.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
They are very highly
valued by certain groups

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
because they
basically can perform

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:90%
any task that you give them.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
It's basically like, you give
a certain program to them,

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:90%
and they will do it.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a super
controversial thing.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what we see is
that they are, for example,

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
used a lot for adult
movies, and prostitution,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and certain other tasks
where they have basically

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:90%
no second thought about.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Are they being used by humans
or other extraterrestrials?

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, both, actually.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen is that
non-terrestrials use them

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
as vessels in order to maneuver
around on the planet to project

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:90%
their own awareness into them.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But we've also seen
that certain groups--

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:84%
human groups around this planet
are pretty interested in them

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and use them for
different tasks.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So one we've already
talked about,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the whole sex
industry, which is one thing.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that we have
an interesting pattern going

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:84%
on with these species,
which means humans,

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
us, again, as an ape race,
they stick together in groups.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And they have this group
conformity thing going on,

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:90%
which other species do not have.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you, for example,
have the reptile species,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't care so
much about the mainstream

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as much as ape species do that
because they rely on their--

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
their evolutionary line
relies upon group conformity.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if you have a
huge group of non-soul humans

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that you can fill with
any program that you want,

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
they will basically
project that into society.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And it-- you can basically
create any kind of awareness

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:90%
through them.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know, if you
want to basically ridicule

00:13:53.950 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
the subject of UAPs, you would
make them laugh about that.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So basically, any
other person that

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
might have a real
authentic experience

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:84%
might be having these
feelings of rejection

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
as becoming an outsider,
an outgroup person.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But they are not actually
dealing with other humans,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
they are only dealing
with programmed lifeforms

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically one thing
how they can be utilized.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And who is utilizing
them that way?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.465 align:middle line:84%
You said the agenda
like with the UAPs.

00:14:34.465 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Who would come down and
make them believe this,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
or come to the media and
talk out loud about it?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that
besides human groups,

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
some extraterrestrials,
especially reptiles,

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
have taking advantage of that
fact because they can clearly

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
identify those humans or
those non-soul humans better.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So they basically would
infiltrate society

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and have groups of people
that could basically

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
take on every task,
be soldiers or do

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:90%
whatever they want them to do.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And we have certainly seen that
over the course of history,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they tracked or
monitored for specific purposes?

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:90%
You just mentioned soldiers.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, those groups that
are interested in them,

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
they make sure that they
know where those people are.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- this is like
gold mining or something,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
like in the old days
of the Gold Rush,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
people trying to get their
hands on as much of the material

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.932 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you recognize
one of these beings, Tim?

00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very
complicated thing to do.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:84%
You basically, by standard
means you cannot recognize them

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:90%
because there's no--

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
nothing that you could-- that
indicates that you are dealing

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
with someone who hasn't got
a soul, because they were

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
look human, because
they are human.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
They will behave in a
certain standard way, which

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.010 align:middle line:84%
means you can, I don't know,
you can buy coffee from them

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:84%
or I don't know, see
a movie with them.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And they will act
absolutely normal.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
They won't do creative
jumps or something as well.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So it will appear like a
super standard human being,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:90%
not super interesting.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But you can
communicate with them.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I would say, there seem
to be some people that

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
have a natural sense for them,
which means they basically

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
feel it in some way
when they-- when someone

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:90%
with a missing soul is around.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
something that has

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:90%
to do with certain patterns.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you talk to them because
they are actually empty,

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
they are, at all times,
looking for new programs,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:90%
looking for new patterns.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And at some times--

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
so basically, they can jump
from one extreme to another

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And they can also, at times,
have certain weird hand

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
gestures or patterns going
on that when you talk about--

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
with them about a
certain topic, about--

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:84%
for example, if you talk
to them about robots,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
you might experience
that they adapt

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:90%
to that idea and certain--

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:90%
suddenly, move a little robotic.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Or if you talk to them
about dogs or something,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
you can see that they suddenly
act a little dog-like,

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:90%
if that makes sense.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with this empty vessel

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
sitting there that is constantly
looking for new ideas in order

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
how to behave, and how to
move, and how to react.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>> If they don't have a soul,
then how would we classify

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>> They are classified as
a second level life form,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
consciousness life form,
which is basically,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
all simple animals out
there that do not have an I

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
awareness, which is
getting more and more rare.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We are heading into
a time of this planet

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:84%
where even animals have a huge
consciousness and awareness

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
of themselves,
which is basically

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the reason for most
of these species, why

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:90%
they live together.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
elephant that is together

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
with humans for a long
time, they naturally

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
know that they are
a living being,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
they know that they are an
elephant, even, whatever

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%
that definition is for them.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say
they're sentient?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the non-soul humans.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, they are.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
They certainly react upon
stimuli, which basically, so

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
they can feel pain and any other
of these impulses very well.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Are they sentient in a
way that consciousness--

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:90%
conscious aware being is?

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I would say, no, unless
you project that into them.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you are conscious
about a certain reaction,

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
you can create a field
where they react upon it.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's the
same way when you're

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:90%
in conversation with someone.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like
your colloquist

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:90%
should cry about something.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Then you're putting out
some kind of energy.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen that the
person you're talking with then

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
starts crying because
you put out that energy.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> So they have emotion?

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> They have this kind of
ability that they pick up

00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:90%
And they could react to it, yes.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're mimicking
the other person or--

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.567 align:middle line:84%
>> --or do they have
their own emotions?

00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, very little
own emotions, I say.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And if they have emotions,
you can basically

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
program that away and program
different emotions into them.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But because they
are so sensible--

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.660 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to other
emotions, yes, they

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
are mimicking whatever energy
you put into your own field.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>> How in development stages of
the human can someone be alive

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:90%
but not have a soul?

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as much as any
insect that you have,

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
most butterflies or
something, they are alive.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:90%
They don't have an I awareness.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.590 align:middle line:84%
They might be having
an I awareness

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:84%
through their hive
system, which is

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:90%
different in their experience.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
They're comparing
insects and human beings.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Most basic insects don't
have an I awareness,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're still alive.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So basically, this is the same
with those non-soul humans.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can, by
interacting with them

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and showing them through your
own self-awareness, what's

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:90%
that like.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
You can introduce
a soul into them.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:90%
And what motivates them?

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Basic impulse reaction stuff.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So basically, hunger, fatigue,
all those kind of things

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.030 align:middle line:90%
are very heavily upon them.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:10%
They do not reflect
that behavior.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:90%
They just live by it.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:90%
What else motivates them?

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
They are basically looking
for certain patterns

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:90%
to understand themselves.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can help
them to gain these patterns

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
or you can put into them
any kind of weird program,

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and they will act upon it, even
to the level that they could--

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
they can easily speak
a different language

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:84%
which they have
never learned, which

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
is a very interesting
thing to see.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.560 align:middle line:84%
You can basically activate
certain linguistic patterns

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:90%
in their brain.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can change
their language,

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:84%
as we have seen with
some other humans that

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:84%
wake up in a hospital
and are reported

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to have spoken a different
language than the day before.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Who stands to benefit from
using these non-soul humans?

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are human groups on
this planet that are interested

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:84%
in getting their hands
on those non-soul humans.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And they are basically
used for certain tasks

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that a aware human
would probably not do.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Like sex trafficking?

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for example.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if you ever
wondered why there are so

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.980 align:middle line:84%
many people in the
adult industry,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:90%
that is one reason, for example.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Could they be used
as killers on missions?

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you saying that anything
that's dark is most likely

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:90%
a soulless human.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't put those
two into perspective.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they are
helpless, in a way,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
that they are relying
upon outside impulses

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:90%
in order to do something.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
they are being

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.410 align:middle line:84%
used for certain things, which
is not their natural purpose

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you can use
them to perform certain tasks.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say, the
way, for example,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
this ET, whoever that was, used
them in order to make contact,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that this is like
a lighter approach.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Now are these non-soul
humans part of a AI scenario?

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That is a very
interesting question, Emery,

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:84%
because when you talk to most
technicians in those projects,

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:84%
these people have a distinct
perspective on life.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to them,
they are 100% into the--

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
it's all in a
simulation scenario.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So they believe
in that very much.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They do not believe that there's
anything else than a computer

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:90%
that the universe is.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they are right.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the universe
is much more than that.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I do understand the way they
have a perspective on life,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:84%
in a way that they say
the universe shares

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot of components that
is similar to simulation.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And from that
perspective, they would

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:84%
say that the AI has
beings on this planet.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And the AI itself is not
aware of having these beings

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So they-- yes, they put them
into an AI scenario, which

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.980 align:middle line:84%
is, I wouldn't say, this
is not the full truth.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the government
doing about this?

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They know about it.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say, some of
these beings are used--

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:84%
some of the non-soul humans
are used for certain purposes,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:90%
for certain--

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
transporting certain
messages, for example.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you need a
big mass of people

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that stand behind
something, then you

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:90%
can program these beings.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
100,000 people that

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
might go on the
street and protest

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
for that specific
cause, just because they

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:90%
are programmed to do so.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they being more used by
humans or extraterrestrials?

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say that
there are human groups that are

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
specialized in this.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And they are pretty--

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.870 align:middle line:84%
they value these
beings very highly.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, are they a
threat in any way?

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Not by its--

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:24.560 align:middle line:84%
by themselves, because they
are basically empty vessels,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You can still-- when you
interact with them and you

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:84%
see danger in them, they will
certainly react upon that

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and pose the threat if you
project out your energy.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like a dog, for example,
a wild dog or something,

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
when you project out
fear or something,

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.928 align:middle line:84%
it's more likely that the dog
will attack you in some way.

00:26:49.928 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can get them worked
up is what you're saying?

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you can
influence them heavily.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you give a different
energy into the room,

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
they will act upon
it differently.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It's getting more dangerous
when you put in some programs

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
into these beings
that might be harmful.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So can a non-soul human mate
and have a relationship with

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:90%
a normal human?

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they can,
because basically,

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:90%
they're 100% biological human.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:90%
So they can have babies.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:90%
They can have relationships.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm 100% sure
that there are amounts

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of people that are currently
having relationships

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:90%
with non-soul humans.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that result?

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends over time when
you have a very loving and dear

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.750 align:middle line:84%
relationship to a non-soul
human or an animal, whatever,

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:84%
when you call it
a pet, over time,

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.950 align:middle line:84%
they will develop some kind of
soul, some kind of I awareness.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the natural pattern
that the universe has,

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that it puts non-experienced
lifeforms together

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:84%
with experienced lifeforms
so they can share

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.050 align:middle line:90%
information and grow from that.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> What about two
non-soul humans together?

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, 100%, you can make
them mate and have children.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Most probably, the offspring
of two non-soul humans

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:90%
will be another non-soul human.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But basically, in that progress,
a soul could enter the fetus

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and make it a regular
soul human being.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:90%
But yes--

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.915 align:middle line:84%
>> They could give birth
to a person with a soul?

00:28:42.915 --> 00:28:43.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And this person could then
give its information down

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:90%
to the non-soul humans.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And they will start
having a regular soul

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:90%
in an I awareness, yes.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So as humankind ascends,
where do they fit in?

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If it comes down
to natural patterns,

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I would say that they are
learning from regular aware

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
human beings and developing
them from that point on, getting

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:90%
more aware.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:10%
So basically, I would say, if
it comes to a natural pattern,

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:31.990 align:middle line:10%
untouched in a way which it
is not, then I would say,

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:10%
there will be a time when there
is no non-soul animal or life

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:10%
form on this planet, and only--

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:10%
there will only be beings with
a level 4 consciousness, which

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:10%
is an elevated I awareness.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm more than myself.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm more than I am.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I am this experience.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.850 align:middle line:90%
This is level 4 consciousness.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they
would eventually

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
go from level 2 consciousness
to level 4 consciousness,

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and be regular human
ascended beings.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is the scenario
only when it's untouched.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And as long as there
are some benefits

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:84%
to keeping those
non-soul humans,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.420 align:middle line:84%
they will not have the chance
to develop in a normal way.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they connected to source?

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything is
connected to source.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And they are connected
to source as much

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
as a stone or this table
is connected to source.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:84%
If you leave them,
they would definitely

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
have a more or less
normal development

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:90%
of their consciousness as well.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:90%
So basically, as the Buddhist--

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Buddha says, everything
contains the nature of Buddha.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
They also could become
highly conscious beings

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:90%
if you let them.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the difference
between a non-soul human being

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and a fairly
unconscious human being?

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as someone has
an I perception, meaning,

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that I am something,
then they have a soul.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So if they don't,
even if they pretend

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:84%
to have an idea about what is
I, even if they say, I am--

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, and they
say a name or something,

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean that they
reflect upon that as much

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:84%
as a dog, for example, that
has this thought and knows,

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.930 align:middle line:84%
oh, I am this because
my human is calling me

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:90%
like that or something.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, you can have
a very low consciousness

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:90%
and have an I awareness.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Low consciousness in terms of
a non-functional consciousness,

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.000 align:middle line:90%
a non-elevated consciousness.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:84%
A consciousness that might be
focused on the lower interests.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> The lower echelon, yeah.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:90%
But that could also--

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:84%
but that still means
that someone has a soul.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But then again, there are
beings that have no I awareness.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't reflect upon that.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.090 align:middle line:90%
So they don't have a soul.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, thank you so much
for being on the show.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
