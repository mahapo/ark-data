>>EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that relates to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.845 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, Tim,
you really got

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to explain to me, what
is a Trogdaborian.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: We're talking
about a specific frog race

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:10%
that, for the first
time, I came across when

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:10%
I was doing the projects and
was working with the Greys

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:10%
because they pushed me to meet
these beings, which I was not

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:10%
ready for at that time because
all the stress and trauma

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:10%
that was introduced to
me through the projects.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I wanted
to do at that moment

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
was to be thrown
into something new.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Describe for me,
Tim, as best as you can,

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
what does a
Trogdaborian look like?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I've never met them.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I've only been
informed about them.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So a Trogdaborian is-- they
are actually much more related

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:90%
to a frog race.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, they have all
those features that a frog has,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:84%
much smaller than an average
human but much bigger

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
than a typical frog that
appears on this planet.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But they actually evolved
from, well, a frog species.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So they are also bipedal,
again, which is kind of curious

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
because who would assume that
a frog actually finds a way

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:90%
to stand up and take a walk?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually
what they do.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
They also live in
a red star planet.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Their home planet is actually
oriented around this red star.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And these are the information
that I've been informed about.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they are somewhere
between a human and a frog.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Can you be a little bit
more specific about that?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Basically,
their height is about--

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
so from what I've read,
they're a little bit taller

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:90%
than a typical Grey.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about,
I don't know, 1 meter

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and 60 centimeters in that case.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But, again, this is much
bigger than any frog

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.983 align:middle line:90%
race that occurs on Earth.

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What are they like?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And where do they live?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Again, they originated
in a red star system.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But they are one of the oldest
known races that actually

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:90%
inhabits this universe.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So they are also one of
the original native races.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And, again, if we're talking
about the different timelines

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that appeared 15,000
years ago, they

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.335 align:middle line:84%
were one of those observers
that actually started life

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:20.803 align:middle line:84%
in the universe in the
way that we know it today.

00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why were you
introduced to them, Tim?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
significance of that?

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the
significance of them

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
is that they are highly
evolved beings in that manner.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:84%
They also are extremely
advanced technologically-wise

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
because their lifespan is almost
a million years per individual.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So they live very long
lives in that manner.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And they also can take
this time in order

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
to build and create and
learn much more efficient

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
than a human who only lives for,
I don't know, 80 years, maybe.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You say they
live in a red star system.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Where is that in relation to us?

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So that's the system
that they originated in.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But they actually are
one of those races that

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
are capable of creating Dyson
spheres, which are planets

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%
that form around a sun.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
the size of a sun.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So the planet that they inhabit
is actually a mobile planet,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So they use this
home planet in order

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to move around the universe
in a very efficient way

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
because they are constantly
carrying their own energy

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%
source within their own planet.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So while
they resemble a frog,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
they are actually
land-based beings, right?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: What I've learned
is that they evolved

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
from what we potentially
most likely know

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.775 align:middle line:90%
as tree frogs in that way.

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:90%
So they're land frogs.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And their whole planet is
actually artificially created

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
by themselves.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have an artificial
planet, gigantic in size,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that they use in order to
maneuver around the universe.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But they also
appear and are very

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
interested in the situation
that occurs on Earth.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So they have certain
ships that actually

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:90%
are based around the planet.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So a being who can
live up to a million years

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and is so technologically
advanced that they can create

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
planetary systems, now, Tim,
what possible interest could

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
they have here with Earth?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.545 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: What I've been
informed-- again,

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I've not met them
because I felt I was not

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
ready for that, which might
be different today, I guess,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:84%
because I find it more
and more interesting

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:90%
the more I think about it.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.060 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be one of
the first species, one

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
of those primal species,
very pure in genetic,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
again, if you want to think
about that, who actually

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
explore space and time.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
They actually saw the universe
as an opportunity in order

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to place life forms and genetic
material on different spots

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and what has
been documented as that they

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
have done so, for
example, in order

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
to place their own genetic
material on Earth as well.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what earthly
manifestation have they

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:90%
placed their genetic material?

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So what they
found is that they

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
had an interest in raising
life forms on different planets

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that they found in their
version of the solar system.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
planted and helped

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to evolve the primal species
that actually went to Earth.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And we talked about that.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
They helped them to evolve
into a more complex land life

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:84%
form, which, ultimately
through conflicts

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and genetic manipulation
through other species,

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:90%
resulted in being Homo sapiens.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What would
the relationship

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
between an ancient
species like the frog race

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:84%
be with the Greys or the
other ancient species?

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, that's
actually the first time

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
where I've came across that
species back in the project.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically
doing this contact work.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced to the
existence of these beings

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
through a Grey
who actually asked

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
me to be introduced to
this species, to meet them,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and to help generate
kind of a triangular

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
relationship between humans,
Greys, and Trogdaborians.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If the Greys are in
contact with the Trogdaborians

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Greys existed
before the universe,

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.070 align:middle line:84%
they are millions, perhaps
billions of years old.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
What was their interest
to integrate you

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
into the conversation who has
a lifespan of 80-plus years,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:90%
perhaps?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, I don't want to be
determined about my lifespan.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But, well, the
Greys are actually

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
interested in setting up a
system of warriorlike creatures

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:90%
or species.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what they called
the Order of the First,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
or this is at least the
English translation that I

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:90%
put to the German equivalent.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So the Order of the First
is actually a conglomerate

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
of warrior-type species that
all come together in order

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to defend the overall
evolution of the universe

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
in a harmony creating way.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of the
Greys was bringing me

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
into contact with
the species and then

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
having me translating or
giving those information just

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that it did
with the Greys to my group

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and through that to this
advanced military governmental

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's so hard to imagine
extraterrestrial races, so

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
ancient and advanced, needing
humans as a warrior race

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
when their technology is so
advanced beyond comprehension.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Why do they need us, Tim?

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: These beings
are super smart.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And they also overlook
possibilities and probabilities

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and time.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And the human species is a very
rough and warriorlike species.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So they might not be able to
cause intense harm right now.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
But if they would not be
integrated in a bigger

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
organization, they could
be causing problems

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
over a certain amount of time.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you think, I don't
know, 120 million years later

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
or something, if you do
not integrate humans,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
they might evolve into a
malevolent species that

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
could definitely harm the
system in a significant way.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually the
thought of the Greys

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
but also the
Trogdaborians in order

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
to get in contact
with all these species

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and to guide them and teach them
but also have an eye on them

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.080 align:middle line:84%
in some way because,
again, we need

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to resolve these issues
that we have with conflicts.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's much better
to keep people

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
close to a superior system
and to teach them some way

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
how to integrate
into that system

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.623 align:middle line:90%
than just let them roam free.

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Throughout
human history,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:84%
if they were one of the original
races that perhaps contributed

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
to our DNA, where else
have we seen and known

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:90%
their influences?

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I've actually
not seen their presence

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
in any kind of way on
this planet right now.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
I know is that they

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:84%
are in contact with certain
groups on this planet,

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and that they keep
an eye on the shift

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and the evolution
of the human species

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and also being connected to
the military nature of what's

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
going on in order to bring
them to a benevolent status.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they are
aware of humans for, well,

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
all the linear
time that we have.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So they are also always
watching what's happening.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And they are in contact, at
least for the last few years,

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
with certain people on
this planet and especially

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:90%
the military.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I assume that if there
was no contact before me,

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
there was definitely
contact after me.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
I see is that it

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
would be of interest
for the Greys

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to choose me to get in
contact with the Trogdaborians

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.495 align:middle line:84%
because then the
Greys would have

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
this triangle of
communication and, more

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
or less, a direct
form of communication

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:90%
with those beings.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also aware that after
me, the Greys definitely

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
had conversations and diplomatic
contact with the Trogdaborians.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that
definitely happened too.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Again, it's
hard for me to comprehend

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
why these highly advanced
beings like the Greys

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
would seek a more primitive
group like the humans

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.375 align:middle line:84%
to be the intermediary
between them and the frogs.

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
How could you make us
understand that better?

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's not about
the intermediary.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It's more about this
triangular relationship

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted to establish.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
opposing different versions

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and realities.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about a moment
outside of the 15,000-year span

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and outside of linear time,
then you have a reality field

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Greys that is in
interaction with the Earth,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
giving them genetic material
and also trying to get some

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
material from the Earth
into their system.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
Trogdaborians who

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:84%
are completely separated
in that moment from Earth.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment, those
two very advanced species

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
do not even know
from each other.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's only about
the middle way

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that when linear time
comes into existence,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that you have the
species itself that

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:90%
combines those two realities.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you're inside of
time, inside of linearity,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
then you suddenly
have a time string

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
where Trogdaborians and Greys
are also both interacting

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:90%
with the same reality.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
But still, the question, why
would the Earth matter to them,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I would say thinking that only
because you're less advanced

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and have less technology than
other species, that's a pretty

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%
human thinking, I guess.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that very
hyper intelligent beings value

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:84%
a species by their
amount of technology

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:90%
or by their intelligence.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
It's more about that they value
species for their potential,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
for their evolutionary
potential.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And surface Earth
humans have one

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
of the highest evolutionary
potentials of all species

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is that?

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Because there's
so much chaos going on.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And chaos creates
opportunities and learnings.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
We have seen that all
these species are putting

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
their own genetic material
on this planet in order

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
to evolve them in
this atmosphere.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So all these beings
are actually part

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.450 align:middle line:84%
of a timeline where
there's so much stress, so

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:90%
much coordination necessary.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And once Earth humans
have overcome this chaos

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:90%
and these challenges--

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:90%
it's just like a muscle.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
If you train it, you
need to stress it.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
At least if you think
about 3D realities,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:90%
there are other ways to do that.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you think
about this linearity,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
then stress means
adaptation, and adaptation

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:90%
means evolvement.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why humans are so valued.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, you just
mentioned 3D reality.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And you describe
the Trogdaborians

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:84%
in a physical vessel
or a physical reality.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.980 align:middle line:90%
What realm do they live in?

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They exist
in a 3D manner.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just that their
evolutionary path

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:84%
as any other species
as well comes

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:84%
from a plane of existence that
is much higher than the 3D

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So humans as well, we all come
from one source, one creator.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And this creator layers
down its consciousness

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
until we have a 3D
form in that way.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Only because humans usually
don't remember that,

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that they
are only a level three

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
And their higher self, they are
level six consciousness just as

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.345 align:middle line:90%
any other being as well.

00:17:08.345 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So a soul
that has lived

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
in the vessel of a frog being
with a life of a million years

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
with experiences
and capabilities

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
beyond human imagination,
and that soul's

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:84%
now incarnating with
a human form in life,

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:90%
what would that look like?

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's very theoretical.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if we have
an incarnation system,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
then usually, cells do not
remember their previous lives.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're using some
kind of technology

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
in order to stream your
consciousness into a body that

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
might look human
but is actually not,

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
then you still have
your whole treasure

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
of experiences from
your other existence

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
because that also
parallelly exists.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I would say that both worlds
are so different to each other

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:90%
in all their--

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
the way that I've
read about them

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is that their whole society
is very exotic and very

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:84%
different to what we
experience as humans.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that I
could give an answer to what

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
a life of a frog experiencing
human life would be, actually.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
He would be pretty
much confused, I guess.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But this Earth itself, it has
all its own streams of reality.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So people that are
born into reality,

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:84%
they are educated on
certain realities.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:84%
They are educated on
being certain individuals.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And that also means
that the likeness

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
of losing your identity,
your previous identity

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:90%
is pretty high.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But, again, if you're
coming from a realm

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
where you're pretty
much integrated,

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
then you will remember
after quite some time.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
You will feel alien
to this world.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You will maybe even have
certain special skills,

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
like psionic skills,
telepathy, or something,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
where you will
constantly be reminded

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of your presence in
these other worlds

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
because they are so much
anchored into your self.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, you could,
at any time, decide

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:84%
to not identify yourself
with the previous version

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:90%
of yourself and become human.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But then your previous timeline
and your previous existence

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.982 align:middle line:90%
would be just vanished.

00:19:32.982 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What else
have you learned

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.195 align:middle line:84%
about the Trogdaborian
society and life?

00:19:37.195 --> 00:19:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we're going to talk
about the Council of Seven.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Trogdaborians
are actually

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:84%
members of this
Council of Seven.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And they are also bringing
species together in order

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.450 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with them.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:90%
This is what I've learned.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:90%
This is what I've read.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So there are active meetings
between different species

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:84%
that the Trogdaborians
also attend.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.857 align:middle line:84%
So this is quite
interesting to me.

00:20:02.857 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are the
Council of Seven?

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And where do the
Trogdaborians fit into that?

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the Council
of Seven actually

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
is a life form on level
seven consciousness.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's the only
life form that we

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:84%
know that has ever reached
level seven consciousness.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And level seven consciousness
is actually-- well,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:84%
it's the godlike
nature of everything.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's within everyone
and within everything

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
that we experience.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84%
On this realm, planets
are actually life forms.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn is the representation
of the Council of Seven

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:90%
in the solar system.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a very,
very, very high dimension

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness and reality.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But they reach down to
level three consciousness

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:90%
through this council.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Council of Andromeda
are the actual representatives

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of this Council of Seven.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way
that they communicated

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
to humans and to other species
in order to bring them together

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and to solve those
paradoxes that

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
are so heavily on this reality,
like, for example, the warrior

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.637 align:middle line:84%
nation, the warrior type, the
warrior issues that we have.

00:21:21.637 --> 00:21:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the
current influence

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Trogdaborians with Earth
at this time of our existence?

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: As far as I'm informed,
the Trogdaborians actually

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
have, on the north
side of this planet,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
their own temporary
life environment, a ship

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And they are actually observing
what's going on this planet

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
right now because they
have an interest in seeing

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:84%
a stable timeline
happening on this planet.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And through that, there is
a communication between them

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and different other
groups on this planet

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to exchange
strategic information.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm well aware that
the Trogdaborians are also,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
as outsiders,
influencing or keeping

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.863 align:middle line:84%
an eye on the societal evolution
that's currently happening.

00:22:19.863 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Especially
during this time on Earth,

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
with all the rife going
on, do the Trogdaborians

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
have a mindset to get involved
with that and intervene?

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Or are they just
merely an observer?

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Again, I've never
talked to them specifically,

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:90%
but I've talked to people.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And what those people from
the military have told

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
me is that there's some
kind of pressure coming

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:84%
from the Trogdaborians
that they are

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
pushing towards
a more integrated

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:90%
societal aspect of Earth.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to
be not a pass--

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't seem to be a
passive overseeing of things

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:84%
but more of a pushing towards
a more proactive solution.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: On a previous episode
of "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Randy Cramer talked about
a frog race of beings.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Are we speaking about
the same race of beings?

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, 100%.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So, well, that was actually one
of the most interesting moments

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
in "Cosmic Disclosure"
history to me

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
because I've been coming
from all these very difficult

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And as many people
and viewers know,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that my motivation or
the initial moment for me

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to come forward in
"Cosmic Disclosure"

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
was actually watching Randy
Cramer speak about many things

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
that I felt was very legit
and very valid information.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
That also raised the
question inside of me

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to get some answers
to some unsolved questions

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:90%
that I still have for myself.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, we talked about
the so-called banana beings.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And he gave some
interesting answers to that.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So having him speak
about the Trogdaborians

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
was really, really
surprising to me

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
because I actually
had never, ever

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
heard about them in the
public discussion before.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So I was super surprised
at that moment.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I
knew that he was talking

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:90%
about the Trogdaborians.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And after the show,
he actually came to me

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and said that he had a
clearance to introduce me

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to the Trogdaborians, which
was super interesting.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have time
at that evening.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But I would be much more open
to meet these beings after I

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
had the chance to integrate all
my previous experiences inside

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:90%
of my own psyche in that way.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.967 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:24:55.967 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you feel
an actual meeting

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
with the Trogdaborians
is in your future?

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Or was that a missed opportunity
that you'll never have again?

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: This is the second
missed opportunity in my life

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:90%
to meet them, actually.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But then, again, I'm
pretty much open to meet

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
any friendly species
and beings out there.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.920 align:middle line:84%
That's just my own
curiosity but also

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.490 align:middle line:84%
my understanding of making
friends with life in that way.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In all
the shift happily

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
now effort and as a
momentum picks up with that,

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:84%
do you believe the
Trogdaborians have a role

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:90%
in that shift of humankind?

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I hope so much.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So all shift happily now--
and I'm really happy that

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:84%
the community came
up with the all--

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
describes a moment where
we all as collective,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
as aspects of the unity
of the unified field,

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
we all make a happy
shift for ourselves

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.980 align:middle line:90%
and for everyone else.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't exclude anyone.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:90%
It includes everyone.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:90%
So they must be part of it.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know that they are
pushing for a stable and more

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:90%
integrated time to come.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty happy that those
species are actually out there.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I can only ask everyone
to get into meditation

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and to get in contact with
every benevolent species that's

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.
