>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:10%
Portal missions--
what's it like to enter

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:10%
into another dimension?

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.664 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be fascinating.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.496 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These
portals-- what do

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
you have to do to gear
up to go into one?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yes, I mean,
there's a lot behind that.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:10%
I mean, not only just
getting in shape for this

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:10%
because you might be
going somewhere where

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:10%
the air is a little thinner.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't been
training at high altitude,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a hard time
trekking and a half mile out

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:90%
and a half mile in.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot
of physical fitness

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
training you do have to go
through based on the mission.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:84%
The mission also by the way,
it's not like they call you up

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, you're
going away tomorrow.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
No, this is something
that's planned out

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
for months, and months, and
months, and months in advance.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:90%
So you get to meet your team.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
You get to establish a rapport,
establish personality profiles

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
with each other to get that
camaraderie to work together

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:90%
for the mission.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is the first
thing that would happen

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is there will be a
mission plan, let's say,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:90%
three to six months out.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And they would get
a group together.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And it depends what
the mission is for.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Do they need a botanist?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Do they need, you know--

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:90%
what kind of--

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Right, a medical
doctor or something.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:90%
What is the mission?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
What kind of engineers
you need for this mission?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
What type of a geologist do
you need for this mission?

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very
specific thing.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's usually around
six to seven people in a team.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
medic that can do

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:90%
three or four different things.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
There's usually
a security person

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
that also can do three
or four different things.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the main scientists

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that are there for specifics
for whatever that mission.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go through three
months of number one,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
just education of the
background of where we're going.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.375 align:middle line:84%
So we get to see the debriefings
of the past 150 missions.

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Seems
pretty intensive.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's very intensive.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot of
information all at once

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:84%
because there's some
things you can touch.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
There's some things
you can't touch,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
which they found
out the hard way.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's these
rules, and regulations,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and protocols
specifically that you

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
have to follow when going
through any mission-oriented

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
portal traveling because if
you don't, things can go bad

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:84%
really quick, such
as the weather,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.599 align:middle line:90%
such as someone getting injured.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Even something like that
will slow up the mission

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:90%
tremendously.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you only have anywhere
from 15 minutes to a few hours

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
max to do your
mission, you really

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:90%
have to optimize that time.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So it is this kind of running
in and running out type of thing

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
for safety reasons
because like I said,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
they haven't really conquered
how long that door stays open.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do they know
where they're going

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:90%
once they enter the portal?

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, in the briefings,
we have lots of video,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
lots of pictures of prior
teams going in and out.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have an excellent idea
of what we're going to expect.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like reading
the map of London

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
before you go to
England to visit.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of know
what's going to be there.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
There are however,
occasions that sometimes

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
this asymmetrically
doesn't work out so well.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And there was one time where
we actually went to a place

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.717 align:middle line:90%
and it was the wrong place.

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: The wrong place?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was the
completely wrong place.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to
arrive in a desert.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We arrived in a
tropical jungle bog.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
we weren't prepared.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
The suits were not prepared
correctly that we had to use.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:90%
The equipment was wrong.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, we were able
to turn around and get out

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of there before the last man
came through, which it was just

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:90%
a different area.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.902 align:middle line:84%
And this area, we'll
have to go back

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
because maybe this
was an area that

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
was never explored because
we've never seen it before.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.066 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What
else could go wrong

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:90%
that you wouldn't anticipate?

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some of
the scariest things

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
are the geological events
on a planet that you're not

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
familiar with.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes bring
these special dogs

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:90%
that are trained for frequency.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And they can hear and tell you
before an earthquake happens

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:90%
or a volcano erupts.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And they have special senses
that they've been trained on.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
They also can smell
certain things.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They've been trained
as a puppy to learn

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
different scents of minerals,
different scents of plant

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:84%
life, different scents of
different types of genetics

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.242 align:middle line:84%
that can smell many, many
different things and sense

00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and hear frequencies
that we can't hear.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
There was an incident
where we were walking

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and there was an underground
bubble just a few feet

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:90%
below the ground.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And someone was just
walking and stepped on it.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And it released this noxious,
very poisonous gas right

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.897 align:middle line:84%
through the surface
and you could see it.

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Without the dog,
you could have gotten killed.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.063 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, we could
have gotten killed.

00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So they can pick up on the
slightest little things.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
protective measure.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do the
dogs that you take--

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
are they wearing
special outfits too?

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.335 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, they are.

00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
they have-- it depends
on where we're going

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and what type of
environments there.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they just
go as themselves

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.434 align:middle line:84%
with a little backpack
and all their equipment.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: A little
leash and off you go.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, they're not.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they have special
helmets for these dogs.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They always have eye
protection all the time.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:90%
They wear these giant goggles--

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
these special iridium
goggles like you

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:90%
see on the astronauts helmets--

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:90%
when they go to these things.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Some of these can be waterproof.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
They actually have special
designed suits for these dogs

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
where they actually have
their own helmet system

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and they have ways to read
the atmosphere for testing.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends on
the type of mission

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:90%
and where they're going.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.138 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there
a specific breed

00:06:48.138 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:84%
that is better than another,
like German Shepherds

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.484 align:middle line:84%
Some of the breeds that we use
mostly are Mastiffs because--

00:06:56.484 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Those are big dog.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --they're
big and burly and they

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.400 align:middle line:90%
can carry a lot of weight.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
understand when you

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
put a dog in a suit
and a lot of weight,

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.470 align:middle line:84%
you do need some
strong animal to do

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that plus their sense
of smell is really good.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And that being said,
going back to the threats,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
one of the scariest
things for me

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
are like earthquakes, which
I've been involved with hardly

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:90%
ever on planet Earth.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But through these events
like it just happens.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Also storms can
brew up out of nowhere.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot
of cool equipment.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:84%
We have specialists that
monitor the weather.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we have
also types of robots

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that are with us that
collect this data

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and using special equipment
to monitor the area--

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
just the atmosphere, the
ground, special sensors

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:90%
are in the ground.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In case
something changes.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:90%
And you have the dog too.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
team that are just

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:90%
trying to get their jobs done.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.578 align:middle line:84%
We're just trying to get
in and get out safely.

00:08:09.578 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
That's our job and
very mission oriented.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We have special suits
depending on where

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
we're going, depending
on the pressure,

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and how hospitable
the areas that we're

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.946 align:middle line:90%
going to be going to.

00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we have our
own pressurized suits.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like
a thin astronaut suit,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.462 align:middle line:84%
but you couldn't survive
on a spacewalk for sure.

00:08:29.462 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What about helmets?

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we have
helmets that we use today

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:90%
for salvaging space wreckage.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a very hexagonal helmet
that comes onto your suit.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And you're in constant contact.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's always
in constant contact

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
until you see something
that's really amazing.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Like one, time the
sky at one of these

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
places where it's
constantly changing colors.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.365 align:middle line:84%
It bleeds from
light blue to violet

00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:90%
to pink to yellow to red.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like this weird
cosmic colors--

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:90%
like the whole sky does this.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So we thought it
was just because

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
of where we were that our
eyes couldn't really see.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
We thought it was a problem with
the human body was not able to.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:84%
But they linked it to some
sort of atmospheric gas

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that was surrounding the planet,
kind of the Aurora Borealis.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:90%
The whole sky was like this.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of made us sick as
we were hiking down this trail,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And the constant
changing of the colors

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:90%
were making us like nauseated.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So they had to
use a special film

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that they made
special helmets just

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
for this planet that allows the
sky to look the same color all

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you're saying the
changing colors had some impact

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.186 align:middle line:90%
on how you felt?

00:09:43.186 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, it did.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it had a nauseating
type of feeling that everyone

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.484 align:middle line:90%
experienced, even the dog.

00:09:48.484 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, you had mentioned
the members of the team--

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
some were medical, some were
security, a lot of scientists.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Who picks the team?

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
these team managers

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that are put in place in these
things that have been running

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:90%
it for a very long time.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Some are very new.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:90%
Some are very old.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So they go in and
say, this is what

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
we need to do for
this specific mission.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to get this
type of crystal.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
We need to get
this type of plant,

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
get some samples of
this type of water.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate enough
to do a dozen of these

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
because they always
need a field medic.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:84%
They always need someone
with the experience

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I had with the biology
of plants, and animals,

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials,
and things

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:90%
of other than Earth origin.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.071 align:middle line:84%
So I was harvesting plant
material, and crystals,

00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and dirt, and water,
and things like that.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I
was also security and also

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:90%
a field medic.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.886 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How many
missions were you on?

00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:43.607 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: A dozen--
about a dozen.

00:10:43.607 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Of all the
missions that you have,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
is there one that
really stands out

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and can you tell us
what it was like?

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: One of the
missions that we went on

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
was this planet I was
telling you about.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.855 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a desert and it
had this color changing sky.

00:10:57.855 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have to get back to
that because it was probably

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
one of the most amazing places I
had been because the lakes that

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:90%
were there.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of the trees and things
were all this bioluminescent,

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:90%
iridescent colors.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
They weren't putting
off light, but the light

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
from the atmosphere was
reflecting off of them.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a chrome
world where plants

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.982 align:middle line:90%
and very large trees--

00:11:23.982 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
like you could not see
the tops of these trees.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like redwoods, but
more like redwoods that

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:90%
looked like Christmas trees.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So really big in that triangular
formation type things.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.319 align:middle line:84%
And kind of like
pine needles too.

00:11:36.319 --> 00:11:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like a mirage almost.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, it's like
a mirage, but not blurry.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything's crystal clear.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was because
of all this reflection

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and the lights
from the atmosphere

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I think were making
everyone nauseated when

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:90%
you were trying to do your job.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was lucky enough to go
back there one other time

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:90%
and with these helmets.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were allowing
us to easily just see

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:90%
in one color spectrum.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't affecting us and
you could see really clear.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
The water was the
most amazing thing

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:14.089 align:middle line:84%
because it looked like the
liquid in a light sticks.

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever see those lights--

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yes.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and like the
kids would use on Halloween?

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then
so the whole lake

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
was like this
bioluminescent moving.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a lake and it
constantly had small waves.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't understand
how could this small lake--

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe 20 acres or so--
have waves in it--

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.495 align:middle line:90%
like two feet waves.

00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Because it's
self-contained, right?

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's
self-contained.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is also one
of the first places

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I experienced the earthquake,
which is very unsettling.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing
something as a team,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
sometimes someone else has to go
maybe 300 yards away from you.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of spread
out a little bit.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And we don't stay together
like scuba divers.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We go out and do our thing.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We all have maps already of
what we're supposed to do.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
We have special
GPSes that we could

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:90%
see on our heads-up display.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:90%
We know where everyone's at.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
We can immediately find
out if you're with me,

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what's
George's heart rate.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Is he OK?

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Plus the robot that's with us
is always monitoring everything.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So if something did happen
where someone even-- you know,

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
they have gyros in these
suits, so they know if we fall.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So that they will know
immediately if we fall,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:90%
it will set off an alarm.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's also scary because
we had someone fall off a small

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:84%
cliff because the ground
looked like it was solid,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is another thing with
the geologists that are there.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And they take these
seismic imprints

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:84%
from these robotic
units that will

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:84%
shoot like a wave a frequency
or a sonic wave into that

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:90%
and it builds.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So we want to know
where we're at--

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:90%
is that ground even supported?

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you could just be
walking along and poof,

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:90%
he's gone.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So before we do
that, we get there.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
The robot runs all the
tests on the atmosphere,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:90%
on the ground, and everything.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
We have these perfect
volumetric images of everything,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
so we know, all right, this
is safe up until this area.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:90%
But these things happen.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as
someone gets injured,

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.932 align:middle line:90%
now the mission is aborted.

00:14:21.932 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
This becomes a
life-saving mission.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: One person gets
hurt, you call a come back?

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You cancel the mission
and you bring the person back.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.555 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's say
you've done your mission.

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:31.277 align:middle line:90%
When do they send you out again?

00:14:31.277 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It depends.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, you might
be training for two,

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:90%
three missions at one time.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So you might be in
that three or six

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
months preparing to do maybe
a mission every other month.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what
they called you to do,

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
what missions they
want you to be on.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I've never really done a
mission in more than one

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:90%
per like month.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.522 align:middle line:90%
I've never done--

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's still a lot.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --two in
the same month,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
but I was only part
of that program

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.105 align:middle line:90%
for a short period of time.

00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where do you
train, on this planet?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You train
in the facility,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:90%
wherever that facility is.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
This facility was in
northern New Mexico

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.754 align:middle line:84%
in its own section I'll say,
not associated with the bases.

00:15:15.754 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Underground?

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Underground, mm-hm.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And they have an area there
that is like a classroom--

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.195 align:middle line:90%
very basic.

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And you get to talk to sometimes
people that have already

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:90%
been there.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So every day, it's kind
of like a little school.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
You have about two to
three hours of education.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you have, of
course, your physical fitness

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:90%
is about three hours a day.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
get trained in how

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to work the robots, and the
different types of computers,

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.632 align:middle line:84%
and different types of devices
you're going to be using.

00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
You go through scenarios
where we will actually

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:84%
dress up and just walk
outside in the desert,

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and just like use our equipment,
get very comfortable with it.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:90%
We'll do fake things--

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of fake little
missions before we

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
go to make sure
everyone is comfortable.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And then we do a course.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And then you go.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And then we go.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of
times too, we also just

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
like when pilots are
doing pilot training

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.799 align:middle line:90%
and they run these simulators.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:90%
They do the same thing with us.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.490 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, what happens
when so-and-so falls off

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:90%
a cliff?

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:90%
What's the protocol?

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Bam, bam, how are
we going to do that?

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
What happens if someone brings
back a bad biological agent?

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.590 align:middle line:90%
What do we do then?

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Has that happened?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, that has
happened, where we got

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
quarantined for two
weeks-- all of us.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Jeez.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And luckily, none of
us got-- it was on the suits.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, what
if this organism

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
got loose throughout
the planet here?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, this facility is
a vacuum air-sealed-tight room

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
where these portals
come through.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
have special devices

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a Rife
machine, but a lot larger

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that can scan like a
whole football field.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And it knows if there's a
foreign microorganism on you,

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
like a virus-- a
negative ionic--

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
some sort of negative
cellular material.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to pick this up.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And immediately as
you come through that,

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:90%
you've got to stop.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Alarms go off
and everything else.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Alarms go
off and they have

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:90%
to sanitize the whole room.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:90%
They use ethylene oxide gas.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:90%
They use a frequency devices.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.245 align:middle line:90%
And you just get blasted.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then from
there, you have

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:84%
to go through a separate part of
the building that's an airlock

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and sit in there
like an HBO chamber.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.175 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to monitor
you for like eight hours.

00:17:36.175 --> 00:17:37.849 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
sitting in there.

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And you can't use the restroom.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time
after that gets cleared,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
then you go through
a regular what

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:84%
would be called
decontamination, where they just

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
go you walk through this
hallway and it sprays you

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
with water and all different
types of chemicals.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
free to change out.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to go
through a two-week evaluation

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:84%
where you're put in
confinement with the team.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And they have special
underground apartment complexes

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
for this reason that's
completely airtight sealed.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
kind of live there.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you
have friends that you

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
have gone on missions with that
you still collaborate with?

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: All my friends and
colleagues have all passed away

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.614 align:middle line:90%
in January from that accident.

00:18:27.614 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All of them?

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: All of them.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.978 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You're
the only one left.

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.451 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do
you feel about that?

00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:35.628 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:37.734 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Hurt.

00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good people?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They were my friends.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.709 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is this
program worth it, Emery?

00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Anything to
advance our technology

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I think is positive,
even if they

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
use some of the technology
for the negative.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:84%
There's always good things
that come out of it.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And we do need to
broaden our horizons.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
We can't be quarantined
to this planet forever,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what's going
to happen in the future--

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:90%
if we get along or not.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:90%
We need to be educated.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:84%
The world needs to be
educated and informed

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
about all these amazing things
that are happening out there

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:84%
behind our backs
and utilize that

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
for the good of the
planet and the people.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of
hope that a lot of this

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
is going to come forward
with other people.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
get, of course,

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:84%
people that were associated
with that program

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to come out and
maybe do something,

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:90%
but that's a long shot.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It's more of getting
people that scientifically

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
have the background that been
involved with those projects.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Would you do it
again given the chance?

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.139 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These
missions that you've

00:19:58.139 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
been on, have you stumbled
across extraterrestrials

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
or had some planned
contact with them?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: None of
my missions I was

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
face to face with
an extraterrestrial.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:13.680 align:middle line:84%
We have seen videos from
past missions of other people

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
meeting extraterrestrials
through portals, some

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:84%
even having set up
meetings through these.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But I have never
seen anything face

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.562 align:middle line:84%
to face during my
adventures through that.

00:20:26.562 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why are the
missions so short--

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes, 1/2 hour?

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't they longer?

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because
they haven't really--

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:84%
the longest mission I've
ever been on is two hours,

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:84%
but it usually only lasts
about 15 minutes to 30 minutes

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a safe zone
for that portal to be open.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
It's only open for a
certain amount of time

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:90%
to the certain area at certain--

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:84%
like I said, the planet
has to be just right.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's the
man-made one, there's

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:84%
still a lot of things
that are in place

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:90%
they haven't figured out.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So to play it safe, even
though it's open for 12 hours,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:84%
we just do one in, one
out and play it safe

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:90%
and keep that mortality going.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So they're not
quite sure what could happen,

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:90%
so they call things quick?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The portals that
you use for your missions--

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:90%
what are they?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.827 align:middle line:84%
Are they man-made or are they
already part of the planet?

00:21:23.827 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they
have built the one

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I was going through on top
of one that's already there.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're utilizing not
only man-made energy,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
but they're also using the
energy from the planet.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Does every portal
go to a different place?

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I mean,
as far as that I

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
know that all the portals are
going to different places.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
portals, of course,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that the ETs have
that they're utilizing

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that can go multiple
places using

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:90%
that ley lines of the universe.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can we
though direct a portal

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:90%
to go to a specific place?

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Do we have that
kind of technology?

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, not yet.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what we do is
we wait for a certain time

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
where we know that this is
where this portal is going.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And when that happens--

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and this is how they've been
sending drones through--

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You jump on it.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and then
we jump on that.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We jump on that wormhole
that's open for 12 hours.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The portal
you go through

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.030 align:middle line:84%
is the same portal you
come back in, isn't it?

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's
the same portal.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes since it's been
going on for so long,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
they have actually built
a similar man-made portal

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
on the other side utilizing the
ancient portal that was already

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So that frame I was
telling you about sometimes

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:90%
is located in that same area.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We're concerned about
contamination and viruses,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
but what about
psychological things too?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Anything happen to people?

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.624 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Not so much.

00:22:50.624 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people know
what they're getting into.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
They go through huge
psychological evaluations.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had more incidents being
in the military in hot zones

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
where people were freaking out a
little bit more than the usual.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It is a different
type of environment

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:84%
because you know
you're going there.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:84%
You kind of almost volunteered
to go on these missions.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
You have accepted
that responsibility.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
You know it could get
very scary very quickly.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
might not come back.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So these people, as far as
I'm concerned, are heroes.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
They're the real
superheroes of the planet.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing something
because they believe in it

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and they believe what they're
doing is not harmful to anyone.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And even though it
may be-- you know,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
we are just a group of soldiers
going in to complete a mission.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you
collect all this data.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:84%
What do you do
with it afterwards?

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think they're
just making a database,

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
like we do with ETs and
extraterrestrial craft,

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and logging in.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:90%
They know where we're at.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
They know if we're on Mars
or in another solar system.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're just looking
at different habitable places

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to maybe rebuild the
civilization here on Earth

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.350 align:middle line:90%
in other places that are safe.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I think all that
data is being put

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
into some big secure
database for evaluation.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's the
protocol for taking samples?

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it depends
what kind of sample it is.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Vacuum containers-- they
look like a sunglass holder.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have bigger
ones too that could

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
be as large as about three feet
in diameter, like an egg shape.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And these things are
vacuum pressured.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, special gas can
be introduced into the unit.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.402 align:middle line:84%
And some also can freeze
things, like instantaneously.

00:24:56.402 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So different tubes
for different specimens.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Different tubes
for different specimens.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.828 align:middle line:84%
There's only like two or
three different tubes,

00:25:01.828 --> 00:25:03.614 align:middle line:84%
but they all kind of
do the same thing.

00:25:03.614 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Once you put
something in, you can

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
take the air out that
was from this atmosphere

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and fill it full
of a special gas

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
or you can basically
add-- it has

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:90%
a nitrogen-like thing on it.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
It can freeze it instantaneously
and remove the gas

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:84%
because anything that comes
back that was open there,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:90%
you have to be careful.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And the robots
know how many parts

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:84%
per million of
particulate matter

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:84%
are floating around
the atmosphere.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Because even in
this room right now,

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
you have trillions of
particles just here,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:90%
but you can't see it.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have to know are
those particulate matter--

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
is that going to create
something back home?

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that going to be a threat--

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Contamination.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --a contamination.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as that
comes through,

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.157 align:middle line:84%
all of those containers are put
into a another giant container

00:25:58.157 --> 00:25:59.365 align:middle line:90%
and is shipped off somewhere.

00:25:59.365 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Safety purposes.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And then is shipped
off somewhere, right.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.692 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: By going through
these portals personally,

00:26:04.692 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:90%
what have you gained from it?

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:90%
What has it done for you?

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, it inspires me.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
It gives me even more
hope that there's

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:84%
more stuff out there
that can help the Earth

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:90%
and help mankind.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I have a great compassion for
all these different places.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And some places I don't
think we should be

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:90%
because they're so beautiful.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want us to
contaminate them.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is it exciting
to go through these?

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's always exciting.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.795 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's always
something that happens

00:26:30.795 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that never happened before.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.522 align:middle line:84%
And it always gets down
and written in the books

00:26:34.522 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:90%
that this has never happened.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.247 align:middle line:84%
And to be part of that
was really exciting.

00:26:38.247 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is
this technology done

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.790 align:middle line:90%
for the planet--

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.429 align:middle line:90%
the fact that we can do this?

00:26:42.429 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's
advancement in science.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.344 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
we bring back,

00:26:45.344 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
like I said, has to do
with something that they're

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
going to create to
help our longevity,

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:90%
to help the protection of us.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I would like to see
a shift in that,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.230 align:middle line:84%
so they start utilizing it to
clean up the planet because I'm

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:84%
more about let's get
the planet fixed first

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
before we live for
another 200 years.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:90%
That's great-- love it.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But without the planet
being fixed up--

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:84%
because they could be turning
this technology around

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that we get from
these other planets

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and utilize it to
clean up Earth.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Special dirt that absorbs
radiation and things like that

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:90%
that they have brought back--

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and this can be manufactured
is what I'm getting at.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Imagine dumping that into
an area of the ocean that

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
can clean out a 500-hectare
area of radiation in the water.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's these
amazing technologies

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that are coming through that
are kind of being utilized

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong way,
that at the same time

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
can be engineered if they've
got the right people on board

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:84%
or get the technologies into the
right people's hands to utilize

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:90%
it to help the Earth.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery,
great information.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.913 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You're welcome, George.

00:27:59.913 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This is
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,
