00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we are with Tim,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:10%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you
again for having me.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, what
is Project Cassiopeia?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: We have to go back to
the fact that the human race,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens, are not the only
Homo sapiens in the universe.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We actually have to
deal with the situation

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that Homo sapiens originated
on a different planet.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ancestors originated
on a different planet,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:84%
came here, but also
founded civilizations

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:84%
all across different
other solar systems.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And while we know that
especially the US military,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
advanced military
planned and executed

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:84%
missions that went
into the solar system

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
since 1980s but also
beyond this solar system,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
they have found different other
planets and surprisingly found

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
beings that looked
very much like humans

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.603 align:middle line:90%
and indeed were humans.

00:01:27.603 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Before we explore
Cassiopeia and the beings that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
are there, how are humans
received when we enter the air

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:84%
space and finally have
contact with other humanoid

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Oh, that very much
depends on the subjective

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:84%
perception and opinion
of different species.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
everything that

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is very closely
related to humans

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
tends to be happy about it
because it's like almost

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
like a family
reunion in that way.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's because there are
so many very exotic life

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
forms that are--
and some of them

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
are really, really
incomprehensible in that way.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
You cannot understand
their feelings,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
their agendas because agenda
is something that is really

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
important to humans in order
to make sense of their reality.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:10%
And finding another
tribe or another species

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:10%
that is very closely related to
yourself is somewhat relieving.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So this force
that went out in the 1980s

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:84%
in exploration of life like
us then came across humanoid

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
beings in the Cassiopeia
Constellation?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yes, that is true.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So they found different other
humanoid or human civilizations

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:90%
in different star systems.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
They're all coming
from the same ancestor

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
race which was completely
different in their appearance

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
but still in the end
product of them they all

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:90%
were looking like humans.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
similar civilizations,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:84%
yet very significant
individual terms

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
have happened to
their civilizations

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.275 align:middle line:90%
compared to this one.

00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So is there a name
for these ETs that we may be

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:90%
familiar with?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I don't have
a name for them.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know,
especially not in English,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:90%
how they are called.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I assume that they are called
by the names of their planets.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
We learned that their
civilizations are

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
ours, especially when

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
you compare 4 or 5 different
humanoid or human planets

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
in different star
systems, you can

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
see that they all
have cities, they all

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
have transportation systems,
they all cook their meals,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:84%
they eat similar food and
digest the same nutritions

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and the same ingredients
compared to Earth humans.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And the evolution of
their bodies, there

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:84%
are significant
differences in that way.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They are more advanced
in certain fields

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.460 align:middle line:84%
but there are also fields where
they are less advanced compared

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:90%
to humans on Earth.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you have any
examples of what you just said?

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So if we're talking
about one of the examples where

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
humans are much more advanced
compared to other humans across

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
the galaxy, then the warlike
nature of humans would be one

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Technology would be one of it.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the stress and
chaos and all that difficulties

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
or the difficulties that
humans were facing on Earth

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:84%
resulted in a high
degree of attraction

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
to technology and attraction
to warrior tools in that way.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that the
Earth humans are pretty keen on

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
compared to other species,
to other humans out there.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But then again, the
significant differences

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:84%
are that other human planets
have a different more

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:90%
organic approach towards food.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Their planets are not at all
messy and dirty and exploited.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But they have come to a
much better integrated

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
nature, a balance of nature
and their own civilization.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
The way they tend to
organize their cities

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
is much more
effective in that way.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
For me, I found it super
interesting that especially

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
the social cultural
ways of living together.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
They even tend to remind me
of ancient Greece in that way.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are democracies,
interestingly enough.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They all have a one
planet government,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of interesting.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They balance out their
whole planetary government

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
by having very strong local
forms of democracy, which

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
is actually more or less
the model of ancient Greece

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
where you have all
these city-states

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:84%
but also you have a
much larger concept

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
of what all these city-states
have to work together on.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that is
much more improved compared

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.483 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on on Earth.

00:06:35.483 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do we know
about their everyday life?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So all of them have art,
all of them have music which

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
seems to be something that all
human species have in common,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:84%
is their interest in creation
and artistic features

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and artistic behavior, which
has also been found in other

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:90%
primates in that way.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you give a
keyboard to a chimpanzee,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
you will see that he's trying
to make music out of it.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:90%
So all of them have that.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I've never come
across a sample, which

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm very curious
of because I assume

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
that it might sound very
differently compared

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:90%
to what we have on Earth.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
that Earth music went

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:84%
through so many stages
of cultural evolution

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that I would even say it's
much more messy on this planet

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.860 align:middle line:84%
but probably we have
a lot more variety

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:90%
in musical sense in that way.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They do have professions
so this is something

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that also seems to be special
and typical to ape races

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in that way, that they all
specialize on something.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:84%
They share their missions
and they share their task,

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
but the difference is
that on this planet,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:84%
we have a much more
systematic way of including

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
people in pre-organized
structures

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:90%
which is actually pretty bad.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So we put people into jobs
that they don't actually feel.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that
most of these other planets

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:84%
have really found a great
way in order to bring out

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:84%
the most out of each
human, which is for me one

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
of the number one
priorities that we

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
need to achieve on
this planet as well

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:84%
because this is the way that
the planetary system strives.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So the whole governmental
system on their planet

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
is actually focused on bringing
people into whatever passion

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:90%
their heart holds.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
they strive and where

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:90%
they kind of evolve into.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are these beings from
Cassiopeia more advanced than

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:84%
us or similar to our own
level of advancement?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So interestingly enough,
I would say that technology

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:84%
wise, and this is something
that humans automatically think

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
about when they say
are we more evolved,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
they automatically think do
we have the better technology,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:90%
do we have the better tools.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say this
focus on technology

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and tools makes Earth humans
pretty advanced compared

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to any other human
species in the galaxy.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
And they acknowledged that.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But what most people
don't think of

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is the cultural
and social system.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
that this planet is

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
really rough in
that way compared

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:90%
to other systems out there.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And the advantages
and benefits that

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
come from a cleaned-up
social dynamic

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:84%
is incredible because you bring
the whole planetary system

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to a peaceful state
of mind and to a very

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
organized and
well-adjusted focused

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:90%
way of working together.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And that cannot be replicated
by any means by what we have

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have the beings from
Cassiopeia come to visit us

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And is there some exchange
program between us?

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, we had a
civilization 15,000 years ago

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that was way more advanced
than social system that we have

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.290 align:middle line:84%
nowadays before the last shift
which resulted in the flood.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And those civilizations actually
went off planet, partially

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:90%
went off planet.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And we still know that they
have integrated into other star

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
systems as well,
and they have always

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
kept a communication back
to this planet in some way

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and kept their eye on
them, on us on this planet.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is
that there is indeed

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
a very clear exchange between
certain groups of their planets

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and certain groups
on this planet,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and there is also an
exchange and an effort

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.897 align:middle line:90%
in order to help each other.

00:11:14.897 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When you say they're
interacting with certain groups

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, can you
identify who those groups are?

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: From what we know
is that the US military is

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
especially communicating with
those civilizations out there.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
an effort in order

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to bring their knowledge
and their learnings back

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:90%
to this planet actually.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
what we have called

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
or what is called
Project Cassiopeia.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is especially
around one particular point,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
which is the tribal nature
of the human society.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I want to elaborate on that.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is that
all these human species

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
come from one far away relative
that have founded civilizations

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:90%
all across the universe.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But there was also this
kind of thing intermingling

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
with other species that
have placed certain sample

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:90%
groups around the planet.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know that
certain sample groups

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
originated in India, in Africa,
in America, in the Americas,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the so-called-- what

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
we call the tribal nature
of humanity resulted in.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that
these tribal nature that

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
also have different skin types,
different outer appearances

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that this has led to
a lot of confusion

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of conflict on
planet Earth, especially.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And still at this point
of time, the species

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:90%
has not overcome that actually.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But we have also seen the
same or similar dynamics

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
on different other
planets as well.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And they have had their sample
groups integrated, their tribes

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
integrated much, much
better compared to what

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:90%
happened on this planet.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I mean, aside from
being humanoid somewhat like

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:90%
us, can you be more specific?

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And do they have the
diversity of groups

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:90%
that we have here on Earth?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: When we take the overall
species or tribes civilizations

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
all across the galaxy,
then I would say yes,

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:84%
there is at least the
same amount of diversity.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But what you also see that
different planets might

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
have a much lower form
of diversity in that way.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Still, they have found a way
to socially integrate that,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and that also reminds me a lot
of ancient Greece in that way

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
because they found a way in
order to set all their mindsets

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
into a one planetary
system, yet still remaining

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
their unique features of their
tribes and sample groups.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen
on this planet,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
actually, so if I, for
example, go back in history

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and take the sample group
that originated in India,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
then we've seen that
those people from India

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
in the Germanic tribes they
got into war and into conflict

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and went all the way through
Russia and ended up in Europe.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And they never have
overcome and integrated

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:90%
that trauma in some way.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:84%
We still have a lot of
conflict between the tribes

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that are now in
Germany and tribes

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
in different other
places in the world.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Even if it did
not result in war,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
still there's some
tension around it.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So what we see in
those other planets

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is that they have integrated
that in a more playful way.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So they send out, for example,
a representative of their tribes

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and they have all these
kind of plays or games

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
together where it's almost
like a form of football match

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
or soccer match or something
where they all come together

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and they are celebrating
their tribe in that way.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But they also know that they are
all one family on this planet,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and when the game is over,
they have no problem in order

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to give shake hands and
exchange hugs in that way, which

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.338 align:middle line:90%
is beautiful.

00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you offer
me a physical description

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%
of the beings from Cassiopeia?

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I actually don't
know because, well,

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen one of them.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So the description is that
they're much like surface Earth

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:90%
humans as well.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:90%
They seem to have light skin.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They have similar
light eye colors

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and no one would even
recognize if one of them

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
would be in one of the major
cities around this planet.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you learn anything
about their concept of what we

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
call love in their
relationships over there?

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah, pretty much.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So it seems as if
their families are

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
structured very similar to
what we know on this planet.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically a
two-sided relationship.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have one
or, at max, two babies

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
because we see
there's a tendency

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that the better the
social system works,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
the lower the ratio of babies
and that is true for them

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But what we see is-- and
they love intensively.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So they have family
relationships just as much

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:90%
as humans do on this planet.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:84%
And I have no doubt that
humans could pair with them

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and produce mixed babies.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
The only significant
difference I see

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:84%
is that they use their
social system in order

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to integrate and care for
their babies much more,

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:84%
which I like because humans
actually come evolutionary--

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:84%
well, a lot from them
comes from bonobo apes

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and they have this very
intense family connection

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:90%
to their babies.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in their
tribe in the huts

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is actually taking
care of those babies.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So babies in those
primate structures

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
are very much integrated
in the social group.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And the problem that we
have on this planet actually

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.240 align:middle line:84%
is that someone from
outside very malevolently

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
introduced a school
system onto this society

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:84%
where things are
educated and forced

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
into children that,
well, might not

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
be benevolent to the whole
as much as it should be.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And also the way that
they sit all day around

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and get all this information
into their brains

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:90%
does not really--

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
there's not much love
and passion and interest

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that comes from the system
on Earth into human babies.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
that in other places

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:84%
where the social
structure actually takes

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
care of the babies much more
and tries to educate them

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
on rules on how to
behave but also in order

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to become the most
productive and best human

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:90%
for their society.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they communicate
telepathically or through words

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and language like we do?

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Well, they combine that.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So they combine telepathic
elements and vocal sounds.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So vocal sounds
is something that

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
is very typical to
primates in general.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to use
vocal sounds in order

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with each
other and they do so as well.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But they also enrich
their vocal sounds

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
with psionic abilities
which increases

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
the amount of information that
is communicated from person A

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:90%
to person B.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What else can you tell
us about some of their unique

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:90%
technologies?

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So one thing that the
advanced military is concerned

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
about is that the social
structure on planet Earth is

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:90%
so incohesive.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have all this
trouble and conflict

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:84%
across all the different
tribes on the surface,

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to be issues
with the administration

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:84%
as well because
there's so much debate

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and we see that
decision-making is delayed for,

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
well, statistically
over seven years

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
in different parts
of Earth, actually.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an incident
that needs a decision,

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
then we see that it
takes several years

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
until administrative
and governmental systems

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and structures
can react to that.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But one of the major concerns
is that all these tribes

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and the tribal history
is problematic.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So what advanced military,
especially the US military,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:84%
would love to see
is that there's

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:84%
some kind of learning from the
tribal nature and integration

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.510 align:middle line:84%
that those humans have
underwent compared

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on Earth.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And they are actually
using a technology

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that utilizes some of the
physics and physical phenomena

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum well, which
is called quantum mirroring.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So we need to imagine that
everything in the universe

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:90%
is actually quantum information.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
take information

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
from one point of the universe
and copy it and actually

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
paste it onto another location
of the quantum universe

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
watch and observe

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
how this integrates
into their world.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that they would actually

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
like to do in order to
bring this stability

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
around this tribal nature and
their administrative features

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:90%
onto Earth.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What more can you tell
us about the quantum mirroring?

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So basically, everything
that we perceive in this world

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of
fluctuation in that way.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's information
on a quantum level.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can analyze
that fluctuation

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and those information that
are unique to one location

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and just extract this pattern.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you use really
huge generators that

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:84%
would bring in certain radiation
onto a certain different other

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:84%
location in the
quantum world, you

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:84%
could paste these
information onto this field.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It's comparable I would say if,
well, very much lowered down

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:84%
to simple form of
if you have plans

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and you, for example, play
music to certain plants.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, a lot of people
have done these experiments,

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that when you apply, for
example, classic music,

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
classical music to plants,
they will grow differently.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is quantum mirroring
being applied to humanity

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:90%
at this time?

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, as much
as I'm aware of and from

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
the information
that I have, yes,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:84%
it's been going on right
now and it's been used--

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
it's using huge wave generators
in that way in order to bring

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the specific frequency and
information onto the field that

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:90%
we inhabit right now.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do we know if
this is positively applied

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to keeping us a more
limited framework of growth?

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I could not think of
any disadvantages or malevolent

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:90%
issues that it could cause.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's not guaranteed that
the results will actually

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
be the way that people want
it to be because it's actually

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
just giving information
into a field and each one

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us has to
integrate this information.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's more or less
like a radio or radiation

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:90%
therapy in that way.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's bringing
frequencies and radiation

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to place, information
to a place,

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and everyone has to
integrate these new realities

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and these new subtle influences
into their own being.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully the
new information

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
will lead us to a
world where we can

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
have a better organized
administration,

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:84%
a quicker system, a balance
between technology and nature,

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and also a spiritual
connection to our tribes,

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to our fellow humans,
and to nature in general.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If this is currently
going on between us and them,

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
do you foresee a time where
there's an open integration

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.965 align:middle line:84%
of both our worlds
since we're so similar?

00:24:43.965 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, that's an
interesting question.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I would
say that there is also--

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
there is an integration of
their worlds into our worlds

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and vice versa but it's
not been done publicly.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:84%
From the plants
that I've seen, I

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
would say that
humans, well, beings

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that look like
humans, Earth humans,

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
are very likely to be
among the first beings,

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial nature
that are being introduced

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to the human society.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But also because we have a
possibility or probability

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to make people aware of the
dangers that could occur

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
outside of this planet,
there's also probability

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that more exotic
alien type of aliens

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.510 align:middle line:84%
are actually among the first
that are being reported.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about integration

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:84%
on a positive exchange
and a strategic exchange,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
we see that these humans that
look like humans are actually

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:84%
already on this planet and
already are doing very closely

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
work together with other
governmental people

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and military people.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's an exchange
between those cultures.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And we do see that but
it's not publicly made.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they only working
within government structures

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:84%
or are they trying to integrate
into society to see how that

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:90%
works?

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: No.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment, we only
see them come together

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
in certain strategic
roundtable meetings

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and giving input around this
very intense phase of shifting

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:90%
that is going on currently.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they also have
an interest in order

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:84%
to have Earth as a very
strong ally in that way.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're talking about
disclosure, then I've seen

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:84%
plans that it could either go
option A or option B. Option

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:84%
A would be very
closely related beings,

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:84%
humans in that way that
still have some features that

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:13.430 align:middle line:84%
make them clearly
non-terrestrial,

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:84%
like different eyes
or ears or something,

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:84%
that they would
expose themselves

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:90%
to the public in that way.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Or option B would
be a staged incident

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
where we become aware of more
exotic alien type of aliens

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
in order to increase the
awareness of possible dangers

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:90%
outside of the planet.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you aware of
anything in the plans that

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:84%
suggest there will be an open
communication and disclosure

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.040 align:middle line:84%
of these beings to our
society as a whole?

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, I'm aware
of the plans of what kind

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
of an exchange program which
seems to be going on already.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So there are people recruited
more openly than ever before

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to go off planet and
meet those different humans.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's a chance that
this will increase over time.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think that is one of the,
well, the interesting things

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:90%
that could occur to us soon.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is the civilization
from Cassiopeia part

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
of a greater Galactic Federation
who wants to integrate more

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:90%
openly with humankind?

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So as much as I know,
all these human societies are

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
well-integrated into different
other Galactic Federations.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I've said that before, there
are much more alliances

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
than just one because
there are different levels

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and layers to that.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that every
human society out there

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:84%
has an interest in other human
societies for obvious reasons,

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
but they also are very
well-integrated into a much

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:90%
more broader context.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: To conclude
this episode, Tim,

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:84%
what do you look forward to most
in relation to the beings from

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Cassiopeia from what you
know about them and a future

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:90%
relationship with Earth?

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So I'm all about the
social dynamics of different

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.380 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the scientific
field that I

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:84%
come from, governance,
topics, objectives.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So I would be quite happy to
see the integration of all

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
these learnings that I've
read about on this planet

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:39.100 align:middle line:84%
because when I zoom out of
Earth, I see a lot of chaos

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of messy components
that needs to be addressed

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:90%
and needs to be improved on.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:90%
So that would be something.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And I would also
say because I know

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of discussion
about one world governments

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of discussion
about changes,

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and even though I went
through experiences

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of where I would say there
is some malevolent component

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
to the nature of humans as well,
which is kind of unfortunate,

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I would say that changes
are not always bad.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I would say that changes
are pretty much neutral

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's upon us and everyone
to integrate those things.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So I don't always
agree with everyone

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:84%
who says like we don't have
to have a one world government

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:84%
We see through the
different planets

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:90%
that this can very much work.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've seen that
any structure and any system

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
can work if you put the right
intent and intentions into it.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about the
system in that way,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.880 align:middle line:84%
it's much more about
each of us in order

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.808 align:middle line:84%
to make this a happy and
well-structured society.

00:30:59.808 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.217 align:middle line:84%

again for having me.

00:31:06.217 --> 00:31:08.550 align:middle line:84%

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
