00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.430 align:middle line:10%
we are with Ricardo Gonzalez, an
author and researcher from Peru

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:10%
who has experienced multiple
direct contacts with

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial species
called the Apunians.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking about
interdimensional gates

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:90%
they told him about.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.835 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RICARDO GONZALEZ: Thank
you for the invitation.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.477 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I understand the
beings that you came in contact

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
with came from these
interdimensional doors.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate on these
interdimensional doors?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: As we've
spoken about before,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had different contact
experiences with these beings.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Experiences that could be
explained on a physical plane

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:90%
because I was able to see them.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:84%
They appeared before witnesses
and it was very clear.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So are these doors
on a physical 3D dimension?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: Many times in
these contact experiences,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:84%
they have manifested
themselves physically,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
but there is one detail,
sometimes they do it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:90%
on an interdimensional level.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
With the technology that
these entities possess

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and with their amazing
psychic development,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
they can open vortexes for
a witness to enter or so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that they may
manifest themselves.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
These beings have developed
a very advanced technology

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and also possess amazing
psychic capabilities

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that allow them to create
dimensional portals where

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
a witness may enter or
where they may exit.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And in these experiences,
as I was saying,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they are able to
manifest themselves physically.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But on other
occasions, they're also

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.275 align:middle line:84%
able to create
virtual realities.

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Ricardo,
through my experience with

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional beings,
I've noticed that

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial or
the being is actually

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:90%
the spacecraft themselves.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And they can create
these portals,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and they can also create
interdimensional fields.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Is this what you're telling me?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GONZALEZ: I agree.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times in UFO
phenomena in pop culture,

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
there's a great
deal of attention

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
placed on the actual ship, and
the interdimensional nature

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:90%
is not mentioned.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are
entities that are

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:90%
in need of a physical vehicle.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
evidence that they

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
have manifested
physically in our reality

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
being photographed or filmed
or leaving behind evidence

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:90%
such as markings on the ground.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But this is a very
small percentage

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
of what actually happens.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
According to my
testimony of contact

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and what I've researched in
many countries in the world,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon is actually full
of interdimensional patterns

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
with portals or shortcuts
between dimensions

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and also the creation
of virtual realities.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it is
so important to research

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
what we call interdimensional
portals, not only the ones

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that these beings may generate
in order to be better protected

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
during contact so that they
don't have to expose themselves

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:90%
or their technology.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And also, so that they can
interact in a non-invasive

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:90%
way with the contact witness.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
As such, experiences with
interdimensional portals

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
require a great deal of
awareness from the witness.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I've learned
during my contact experiences

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
with these beings in Peru,
I must confess, Emery,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that in the beginning,
I used to think

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that these face-to-face
encounters with these beings

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:90%
were the most important.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
During my first years of
research, the psychic part,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
the mental part, the
interdimensional part,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I would just push that aside
because my intellect wanted

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
everything that could
be seen, touched,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and that other
witnesses could see.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
But as the contact
continued to evolve,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I discovered this
para-psychic world.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered
the existence

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
of these interdimensional
portals created

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:84%
by these beings which are
now the main way that we

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:90%
have had contact with then.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are these gateways
naturally occurring or are they

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:90%
technologically made?

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: As I was saying,
they have a great capacity

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
to create these
interdimensional portals.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
However, there is also
something very unsettling--

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there are
portals similar to those

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:84%
created by
extraterrestrials that

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:90%
occur naturally on our planet.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And many times, when
the extraterrestrials

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
generate these portals to
have contact experiences,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
as a foundation, they utilize
the natural vortexes on Earth

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:90%
to create them.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely amazing.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, they
could create a vortex

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
right here at Gaia
studios because they

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.325 align:middle line:84%
have the technology
and resources to do it.

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But if they want to
do it in a way that

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:84%
is much less invasive
and much more controlled,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
they would choose to do it
in Sedona or Mount Shasta

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
where there are natural
interdimensional portals.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Just to give you a few examples
here in the United States,

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
my ancestors in Peru had a
very particular knowledge

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:90%
about these sacred places.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
In certain shamanic
circles, there

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.190 align:middle line:84%
is talk about pathways of energy
that crisscross the planet.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
They call them the veins
of light of the Earth.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
They are also called
quipus, a Quechua word.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Those quipus or pathways of
the Pachamama or Mother Earth.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:84%
If you enter a Peruvian
museum and saw a quipu,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:84%
they are comprised
of threads of yarn

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
with knots that represent a
numeric or mnemonic system.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And these threads in the
quipus represent the so-called

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
siq'is, which is another Quechua
word actually meaning line

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:90%
or pathway.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
These lines of the
quipus represent

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.125 align:middle line:84%
the siq'is, an ancient knowledge
in the Peruvian shamanic

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:15.925 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, many quipus
found in ancient Peruvian

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
archeological digs represent the
siq'is or pathways of energy.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists and historians
always assumed that these

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:84%
siq'i lines were some type
of land organization created

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
by the Incas, where Cusco
would be the center,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:84%
the umbilicus mundi, the
belly button of the world.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, the
lines or siq'is would flow.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
That would then mark
temples, houses of prayer,

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:90%
special places.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
However, according to
my shamanic sources

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in the Andes, these lines not
only mark temples or places

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of prayer known by the
Incas, they actually

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
marked vortexes of
Pachamama, Mother Earth.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Vortexes that the ancient
Incan gods, whoever they were,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:90%
actually followed.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Vortexes that are perfectly
aligned in geometry.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, the famous
root of Viracocha.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Viracocha was the supreme
deity of the empire

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:90%
of the sun of the Incas.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
He travels throughout
many places in the Andes,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:90%
all over South America.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you sit
down with a map,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and you try to connect
all of those points,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
all of those points
generate the figure

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
of that chakana,
the square cross.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:90%
In other words, it was a map.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:10%
According to the shamans, it is
a map of the Earth's vortexes.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are not only chakanas
or vortexes in South America.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Many vortexes exist
all over the world.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And they know it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, there are many
different types of vortexes.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
The most basic, to
describe it in this way,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
do not necessarily permit
travel between them,

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
but rather capture
information that

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
flows through them towards
the contact witness,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
almost as if you were
entering into a terminal

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
of a great network, a
great cosmic library.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
At another vortex level,
you are able to enter there

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
with many different types
of experiences from the very

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:90%
subtle to the very physical.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But at that level,
the experience

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
occurs in your environment
on planet Earth.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
you're able to pass

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
into a different reality
that is connected

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
to planet Earth, mysteries
of our own world.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And then on a third
level, the phenomenon

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
occurs that you're
asking about where

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:84%
someone can be projected beyond
the reality of planet Earth.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So could we be
bilocal with these vortices?

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>> GONZALEZ: Yes.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have spoken
about this type of contact

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:84%
where a person can be
in two places at once.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
had the opportunity

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to find myself face-to-face
with these beings who

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:90%
we call Apunians.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
In one of these encounters
which occurred in April of 2015

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
in the Peruvian Andes, I was
told to go to a huge rock.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It looked very much like a
dolmen, a European megalith.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrials
had asked

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
me to go to this
sacred rock to have

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:90%
an interdimensional contact.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken about this
other times here at Gaia.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:10%
And as you might remember,
I had the experience

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:10%
of being transferred from that
rock to inside of a mountain,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:10%
to a secret
extraterrestrial base that

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:10%
was inside Mount Huascaran.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:10%
I remember it as a
physical experience, Emery.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
However, my body was
still back at the rock.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
According to what the
extraterrestrials themselves

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
told me, it was not
a mental delusion.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It was not a cognitive
disassociation.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:90%
I was really there.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked these
beings what was happening,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:84%
they explained to me that
I had been bilocated.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a product of an
interdimensional portal

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that they had placed
on that tall rock.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.850 align:middle line:90%
So yes, Emery, it is possible.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.110 align:middle line:90%
They can do it.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What makes a place
on this Earth doors to other

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:90%
worlds?

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: I consider that
related to these shamanic

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.510 align:middle line:84%
teachings about the pathways
of energy across the Earth,

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that I must say
does coincide with what

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
have told us.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:84%
They say that there are
subtle lines of energy that

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:90%
wrap our planet like a mesh.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
These pathways of energy on
Earth have various sources.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So for example, our own
electric magnetic fields,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:90%
our magnetosphere.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Also, volcanic activity.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Another example is what we
call the Pacific Ring of Fire,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
where we can find the highest
seismic and volcanic activity

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, currently,
our most powerful vortexes

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that are active
are throughout the America,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and are tied to
that characteristic

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:90%
of the Ring of Fire.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But for the
extraterrestrials, there

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
are other pathways of
energy, other sources

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:90%
of this type of vortex.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't all happen
due to water or volcanoes

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
or the Earth's electric
magnetic fields,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
there are other sources
of natural radiation

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:84%
that human beings
do not know about,

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.350 align:middle line:84%
which we are unable to measure
for now because we don't

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:90%
have the necessary instruments.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is also
organized in our world.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And from that organization,
knots or vortexes are formed.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And a contact witness
may connect right

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:90%
at one of those knots.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion, I asked these
beings, how does this work?

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that energy
is organized on the Earth

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:90%
and forms a natural portal.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And then those beings will take
advantage of that foundation

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
to build an even more
efficient portal.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we had
a big tablecloth,

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and four people
are stretching out

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:90%
the tablecloth by each corner.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And a fifth person comes
along holding a bowling ball--

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:90%
one of those very heavy balls--

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and places it in the
middle of the tablecloth.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
The tablecloth will
lose its shape and sink.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The space of that tablecloth
will curve, wrinkle, and sink

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
due to the weight
of the bowling ball.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So Ivika and Antarel
explained to me

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
then what they do does
not go against nature

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and its organization.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Simply, they just act upon
the natural nodes of energy

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
where a great deal of
energy is concentrated,

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
which they're able to leverage
that enormous amount of energy

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
in microscopic places.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:84%
But that great
concentration of energy

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
has to be in subatomic
spaces so that they

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
can generate what is called
in physics a singularity.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's easier for them
to create dimensional portals

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
in contact places, places where
the Earth's energy is strong.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And also because they
respect the protocol.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They respect the natural
organization of the Earth.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.730 align:middle line:84%
As I said, they could open a
portal here at Gaia studios.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But here, they would
be much more limited.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
The rules limit them
when trying to open

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:84%
portals and other places that
are not the Earth's nodes.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do you identify
these places of contact?

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: In some ways,
we have the advantage,

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it that way, of
s information from these beings.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to the information
that these beings

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
like Ivika and
Antarel have given me,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
we have been able to find some
of the most important energy

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:90%
nodes.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, once we had
the coordinates marked

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrial, in
the field through research,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
we discovered that the
places were already

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:84%
marked by legends and myths,
which were unknown to us.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The local people that
we would meet would say.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
oh yes, our ancestors
or our grandparents

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
knew that that
mountain was sacred,

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:90%
that things had happened there.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Or it would coincide
with an underground river

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
or cave systems yet
to be discovered.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
An underground
world or petroglyphs

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
from ancient cultures,
symbols on rocks

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:90%
that no one had seen before.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
there were these places

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:84%
that the ancestors
had also known about.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So for example, there are
a lot of places on Earth

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that are very well-known
in popular culture

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
as dimensional portals, such
as the pyramids of Egypt.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Because of their fame and the
architecture and the legends,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
it is easy to see that this is
a very special place because

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
of these great monuments
that were built there.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there an energetic
signature to these areas?

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> GONZALEZ: Yes.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
What is most important about
these places rather than

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
the physical structure
on the surface

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:90%
is their energy signature.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
Pyramids of Egypt.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this place
is actually more

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
important than the
actual pyramid.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid was built
in a special place

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.210 align:middle line:90%
where the gods lived.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
In a forgotten age
called Zep Tepi.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Zep Tepi occurred
25,000 years ago.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
According to the
legend, Zep Tepi

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
happened when the gods of Orion
lived on the Giza Plateau.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
For archeologists
and historians,

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:84%
these are just myths or
legends of old Egypt.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.785 align:middle line:84%
And these so-called gods
known in Egypt as Neteru

00:15:55.785 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
are for many archeologists
and historians

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
considered to be
celestial symbolic powers.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible that
some of these portals

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
were actually
well-known anciently

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrial beings.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
This was passed down
as a sort of tradition

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:84%
for future generations
so that these places

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
were never forgotten.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
They built dolmens,
obelisks, pyramids, temples.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is actually related to
the controversial apparitions

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.050 align:middle line:90%
of Mary as well.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
In many places where the
supposed image of Mary

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
has appeared, in the past, these
were already places of worship.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Temples of the ancient
ancestral people

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
much like what
happened in Mexico

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
in the case of the
Virgin of Guadalupe.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:90%
So nowadays, what is there?

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Churches, basilicas,
temples, people worshipping

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:90%
the apparitions of Mary.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And that way, the place
is never forgotten.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:90%
It's an important place.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And why shouldn't these
places not be forgotten?

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Why this obsession as
if it were a great plan?

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:84%
So that over thousands
and thousands

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
of years of our history, those
sacred places of contact,

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
those for vortexes
are not forgotten.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Possibly because they will
play a very important role

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
in the future
survival of humanity.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can these gates
be activated by humans?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Or only extraterrestrials?

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: Here, we are
entering into a very delicate

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:90%
subject, Emery.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I do know that
you are informed

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
about this as well as
a lot of the scientists

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:90%
of the major powers.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of secret
technological and military

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:84%
projects by the
major powers to try

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate these portals.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if the extraterrestrials
with their great technology

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:84%
are able to interact with
interdimensional portals,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
obviously, humans when they
have that type of technology,

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
they will be able
to do so as well.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:84%
However, to involve ourselves
deeply in dimensional portals

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
without ethics, without
morals, without conscience

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:90%
is dangerous.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that we
need advanced technology

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
to be able to interact
with these portals

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:90%
between dimensions.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:84%
The main tool that we
need is consciousness.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how to explain
this but I will try.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:84%
According to what I've
learned during contact

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
with these beings, just
as the places of contact,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the vortexes, have an energy
signature, we human beings

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:90%
also have an energy signature.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:84%
A light signature, a
vibratory signature.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
According to Ivika,
this is as simple

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:90%
to understand as geometry.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Geometry is symmetry,
perfection, order.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And with that symmetry,
with that energy,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%
the world is built of energy.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when a
human being who only uses

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
advanced technology
as a foundation,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
but who is disorganized
mentally and in conscience

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and wishes to deal
with these portals?

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
understand this

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
because they also face many
challenges and dangers.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
When we separate an
atom, we are also

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:90%
opening a dimensional portal.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
That is what happened
in the United States

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.730 align:middle line:84%
in the 1940s with
the Trinity Project.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough, as
a consequence of this event,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
the modern era of
UFO phenomenon began.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there were sightings
and reports prior to this,

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
but this all intensified
from 1943 to '47.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And we would have
to ask ourselves

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:84%
if, for instance, the
Philadelphia Project actually

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:90%
happened in 1943.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
It is a very complex
case that is surrounded

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:84%
by fake news, which
has now become

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
as much a part of pop culture
as the Bermuda Triangle.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But always behind the
fog, there is some truth.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And every time
that a human being

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
has attempted to open up one
of these dimensional portals

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.010 align:middle line:84%
without consciousness, as you
can see, Emery, the results

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:90%
have not been very positive.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And the big problem with
dimensional portals and time

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:84%
travel in our world,
if we start to attempt

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to play with that
technology that we are not

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
ready for in consciousness,
we are sending a signal

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
to the universe, to other
civilizations with the ability

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:90%
to track us.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you or anyone
that you know has ever entered

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:90%
one of these gates?

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: Yes, absolutely,
as you might with my own

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to be very clear that all
the experiences that I've had

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
have not been violent or
hostile or negative for me,

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
just so the audience
has that clear.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But surely, those who
are watching this program

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
can understand that
it is very difficult

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:84%
to go through your daily life
after you've seen and lived

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:90%
in those other realities.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And much more so when you are
willing to go public and talk

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.967 align:middle line:90%
about these experiences.

00:20:53.967 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
think that you're

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:90%
crazy or just really out there.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I left my profession in a
promising career in Lima

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:84%
once I started speaking
about these topics on TV.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So something that
I've really tried

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:84%
to do so that this phenomena
would be taken seriously

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
has to invite other
people, including

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:84%
well-known researchers
of the UFO phenomenon.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So that they could
also experience

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:90%
some of this phenomena with us.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:84%
We've spoken about this
in other interviews

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and they've also gone through
incredible experiences.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:10%
For example, let me remind
the audience, in 2014

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:10%
here in the United States
on Mount Shasta in Northern

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:10%
California, a
well-known researcher

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:10%
Paola Harris, who
was at one time

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:10%
the assistant of James Allen
Hynek, the father of ufology,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:10%
she had an encounter
with us face-to-face

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.970 align:middle line:10%
with one of these
extraterrestrial entities

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:10%
with a human appearance.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:10%
And this entity, a
male who calls himself

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:10%
Antarel, and he was
about 10 feet in height--

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:10%
10 feet, right?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
He had created an
environment of energy

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Shasta in the
middle of the forest.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
You could not clearly
see the highest point

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:90%
of the dome of energy.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Some people could see
it but not everyone.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
What was very clear was the base
of the interdimensional portal.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
It was like a bright fog.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Very shining, and it appeared
to come from the ground upwards

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:90%
with a phosphorescent effect.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It had a bright
effect, very special.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But there is a very interesting
detail with this phenomena

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:90%
that happened at Mount Shasta.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Antarel was outside of the
multidimensional portal.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
This extraterrestrial
with a human appearance

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:84%
was in a solid
physical body that

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:90%
could be seen very clearly.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So if he was in a
physical body there

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:84%
in the forest of
Mount Shasta, why

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
was a separate multidimensional
portal also created?

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
The objective of that
experience according

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to the extraterrestrials
was for Paola

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:84%
to be exposed to the energy
of that dimensional portal,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and that this
experience was going

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to plant something in her,
to foment a paradigm shift,

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:90%
and Paola has not been the same.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is the military
aware of these interdimensional

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
doors?

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:90%
And are they monitoring them?

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: So we spoke a
second ago about the dangers

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:90%
of opening dimensional portals.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are human
attempts to carry this out.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And obviously,
these attempts are

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
coming from the military
and scientific industry

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because civilians
just don't have

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the means to be able to research
a node or interdimensional

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:90%
portal.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do have information.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Information that I have
from my own contact

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
experiences and also
from amicable sources

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that have been involved in
these military experiments.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:90%
And they're not new.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.635 align:middle line:84%
They've been going
on for many decades.

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're
attempting to monitor

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
any activity, any
singularity that comes up

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:90%
on their tracking systems.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But they always
get there too late.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you aware of
the military or any other

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:84%
organizations that are allowing
technology to go in and out

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:90%
of these doorways?

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: What I am able to
say regarding that are two main

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:84%
First, yes, I am
aware of the efforts,

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
not just from the military but
also from private companies.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Ivika and Antarel informed
me several years ago

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that the main efforts in the
space race and experimenting

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
with some technologies,
including dimensional portals,

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.990 align:middle line:84%
would not come necessarily
from countries or armies

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:84%
or governments,
but actually from

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
the private scientific military
complexes, which have existed

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:90%
for some time, of course.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But in recent years,
they're trying

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:84%
to normalize this information
for the mainstream public

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:90%
so that it would be prepared.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, the private
efforts to colonize Mars.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that
I can say about that

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, efforts
have been made

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to transfer equipment
or technology

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
through multidimensional
portals as an experiment.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But I should also say
and possibly information

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that I have is different than
the information in ufology

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I've had conversations
with ufologists here

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and at various conferences
across the world,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as with some former
members of government

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:84%
in the United States who
introduced themselves

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
to me as such, who told me that
multidimensional portals are

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:84%
used to transfer many human
beings to Mars, for example.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
That there are human
colonies already on Mars.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And that even some former
presidents of the United States

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.090 align:middle line:90%
got a chance to travel to Mars.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:84%
According to the information
that Ivika and Antarel have

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.040 align:middle line:84%
shared with me, that
was not the case.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a portion
of truth in it,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional experiments
to apply them to space

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:90%
navigation and colonization.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
However, there have
been stories added

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to the information that
have attempted to mislead

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:90%
from authentic information.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:10%
For now, all of the
antimatter energy

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:10%
that are big particle
accelerators and Hadron

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:10%
Collider have attempted
to accumulate,

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:10%
for example, the one that
we can find between France

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:10%
and Switzerland that some
people call the machine of God,

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.480 align:middle line:10%
because today it is the most
powerful machine that mankind

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:10%
has built, at least publicly.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:84%
All of that power that that
particle accelerator has

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:84%
been able to obtain
from antimatter

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
has only worked to
turn on a light bulb.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So of course, there is talk of
things being attempted right

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:90%
now with dimensional portals.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But what is not true
is that there have been

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:90%
huge accomplishments with this.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell us more about
these presidents that have

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:84%
visited Mars
through these doors.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And who are they?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: This is information
that has been widely spread

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%
in recent years.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But within the context
of various international

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
conferences on the
UFO phenomenon,

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I was able to speak to
many older researchers

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and former members
of the US government.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And also US government
advisors, or at least that

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:84%
is how they portrayed
themselves, with many of them

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and that there were
experiments to connect

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to Mars through
interdimensional portals.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I had
conversations with many people

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that we don't need
to mention here.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But what I would say from a
journalist's point of view

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
is that where there's
smoke, there's fire.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the most
outstanding thing that you have

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
learned from
interdimensional gates?

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GONZALEZ: This might
sound a little too mystical.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing that
I learned about this phenomena

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:84%
with multidimensional
portals is that nothing

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that is outside of you is
going to open up if you

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:90%
don't open your heart first.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
A very analytical,
rational person

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:84%
who is now watching
this program might say,

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:90%
this is all new age rubbish.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:90%
This is not new age.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:90%
This is common sense.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:84%
How can we explore the
mysteries of other universes

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
or other realities if we
don't know our own mysteries?

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
When I have come face-to-face
with these portals

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:84%
on different expeditions
throughout the world, here

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
in the United States or
Central Asia or the Andes,

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:90%
the pattern is always the same.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:84%
If people were afraid or
their ideas were very jumbled

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
in their head, or if they
were just seeking experience,

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
hunting a phenomena,
the experience

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:90%
would not flow correctly.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So some skeptics would
say to me, oh, you

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:90%
have to believe it to see it.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, absolutely not.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:90%
It is all about learning to see.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:84%
The shaman who I
mentioned in my country,

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:84%
they say that the huacas, which
in Quechua means sacred place,

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:84%
will only open when you
open your inner huaca.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many
of us who have

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
lived through these
contact experiences

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:84%
have started to
practice exercises

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:09.160 align:middle line:84%
of silence, of listening
to nature, of meditation.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And in reality,
we've been doing it

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
as a species for
thousands of years.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the main
message that I learned

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
from interdimensional
portals, and my attempt,

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:84%
my intellectual drive to prove,
to research, to demonstrate.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Because my contact experiences
also transformed me

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:84%
into a researcher and
author on these topics,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I had to realize
that I had to open

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.880 align:middle line:90%
my heart, that I had to listen.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.620 align:middle line:84%
As I said, you have to learn
to see so that these places may

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:90%
speak to you.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:84%
If you don't open
your heart and you

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.010 align:middle line:84%
don't have the right signature
of how you are sounding,

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:84%
how you are vibrating,
all of those

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
portals that you are looking
for will always be close to you.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:84%

so much for being on the show.
