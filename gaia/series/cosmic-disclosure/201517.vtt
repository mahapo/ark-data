>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:10%
we are with Dr. Robert Wood, a
retired aerospace engineer who

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:10%
has worked on everything from
ballistic missile defense

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:10%
to the Space Station.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:10%
More recently, Bob is
the editor of a new book

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:10%
on William Tompkins called
"Selected by Extraterrestrials

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:10%
Volume 2--

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:10%

secret world of UFOs,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.083 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to the show.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.375 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT WOOD: Good to be here.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: William Tompkins
worked on the designs

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:90%
for different spacecraft.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
What did he say about it when
exactly the Americans entered

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:90%
the Secret Space Program?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And was there any competition
from other countries,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
like the Germans, Russians,
or even China in space?

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's an
interesting question, Emery.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, we talked
about just our space program,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and we never really
did get into what

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I would have liked to know,
namely, what the Russians had

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:84%
been doing because, clearly,
they had the capability

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
interest in crashed saucers that
they were probably working on.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So that would've been a
great subject for us to have

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:90%
talked about, but we never did.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He was pretty accurate
in not speculating

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
about what he might have
thought about other things.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
his book is so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:84%
solid is that he really
stuck to the things

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:90%
he remembered very well.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And he typed them
on his typewriter,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
so what we're seeing
in the books--

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%
the first two books--

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
are things that
he actually typed.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing today on the
video are things that he said.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
We have some interviews
done with William Tompkins.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.822 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a quick look at them.

00:01:56.822 --> 00:01:57.885 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.885 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM TOMPKINS
(ON VIDEO): So

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:10%
we talked before about
the different types,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:10%
and [CLEARS THROAT] this is a
two-kilometer long spacecraft

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:10%
carrier, and it's
streamlined to a degree.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And so in one of the big
design review meetings,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
one of the managers said,
wait a minute, Bill,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:90%
it's a vacuum out there.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
make it pointed.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
have atmosphere

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:90%
to go working through.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
well, that's true,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
but the electromagnetic
protection system,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
which we still are not
sure how are going to work,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
may or may not be
capable of handling

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
all of the different types
of vehicles or weapons

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:90%
that could be being used on us.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And then also, under
certain conditions,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
we actually can get into
the planet's atmosphere

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and operate.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we got
around that one.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Now if you can picture here
this area down in here,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to switch
these, and you're

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
going to see the lower
part of the hull.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And what you see there is the
different classes of attack

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and fighter aircraft
returning to the mothership

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:90%
or the spacecraft carrier.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And with a vacuum-controlled
controlled entry sections,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
actually, they were
designed to fold

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
down so that you're
already in support

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:90%
of making inside landing.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.695 align:middle line:84%
Nobody actually flies
in these squadrons

00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and control any of the vehicles.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:90%
It's all automatic.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to be
hitting the walls or any

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of thing.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly, you can open
these hatches on the side.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
The hatch then becomes sort of
a platform to possibly land on

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:90%
if you're too low.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And this answers
the question of,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
how do we handle
the large spaces

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
aboard the ships that are
going to be operating out

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:90%
on the missions?

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So what we had done,
then, was using

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the same type of
design concepts,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:90%
we looked at Marines missions.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the
communication missions.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We actually came up with
virtually hundreds, then,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
of missions and submissions
that we, then, in the tank

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
made recommendations back
to the Navy themselves.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And one admiral, when he
saw that first illustration,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
he made the statement that
just the shape of that

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%
is going to scare them away.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
They'll turn around
and go back, because it

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.390 align:middle line:90%
is a pretty hot configuration.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of the others
are not as good.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And actually, some of
them are rectangular,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
depending on what the mission
is required to accomplish.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think
the video we just

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
saw, the thing that impressed
me the most about that

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
was that these things
occurred in the vault

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
when he was doing a contract
that was kind of run

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
by the young Bobby Ray Inman,
who was giving him directions.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And then later on,
at TRW, when he

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
was showing the ones
that we just looked at,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
those were done
at the same time.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And Bobby Ray Inman
was a consultant.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually a
remote viewer to stuff that

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:90%
was going on for the Russians.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So earlier, you were asking
me about the Russians, well,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
there was one relationship
to the Russians

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
when they had a remote
viewing session where

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Ray Inman and another
guy, whose name was Mitchell,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
were actually remote
viewing the head

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.833 align:middle line:84%
of the fleet for the Soviets
on their ship in detail.

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the things that's

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.875 align:middle line:84%
in the new book that's
kind of exciting

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:84%
is there's a couple
of pages describing

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that actual remote
viewing conversation.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.265 align:middle line:84%
And in the context of the
shape of the Soviet ships--

00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
because they were
changing their ships.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
These are water ships,
not space ships.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.862 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, those images
reminded me of these two things.

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It looks like some of
our new battleship cruisers,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:90%
with the different angled edges.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing, you told
me earlier that he said,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
these are 2, 4, and
8 kilometers long.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that's
bigger than anything

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.295 align:middle line:90%
we have right now.

00:07:02.295 --> 00:07:03.712 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:07:03.712 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But up there,
it doesn't matter.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:90%
We have all that space.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, psychics get a
really bad rap out there.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:84%
But yet, here we are, in
trillion dollar projects,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:90%
using remote viewers.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.488 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:07:16.488 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, that was one of
the things that excited me when

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
Bill's job at TRW

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
included exposure to some of
these top secret programs,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:90%
one of which was remote viewing.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they had professional
remote viewing processes

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:90%
in place.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of those was
actually looking down

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
at this Soviet ship to
find out what was going on

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:90%
in the Soviet thinking.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they did
some remote viewing

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet ship, Bobby
Ray Inman and another guy--

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of getting
data that the country needed

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:90%
about the designs.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And the designs
actually turned out

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to be helpful in
our design thinking.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Now did
Bill ever mention

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:10%
the remote viewing of
extraterrestrial craft

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:10%
or the extraterrestrials
themselves in the projects?

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We never talked
about the remote viewing

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
craft, but we did talk

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
about the use of remote viewing
by aliens and to aliens.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think, once, there was a
remote viewing situation where

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
instead of going to the
target they wanted to go to,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.289 align:middle line:84%
they wound up in an
alien craft overhead.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall, it is
written up in "Volume 2"

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:90%
the details of that.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually kind
of an accidental thing.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know
any remote viewing

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.315 align:middle line:84%
programs that have to do with
finding out what's in our seas?

00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I
do happen to know

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that one of the early remote
viewing programs that SRI used

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
was to try to do
remote viewing and have

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
information contact with people
in a submarine underwater.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:10%
However, Bill's involvement
with Navy issues

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:10%
with remote viewing
for underwater

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:10%
really was linked to his
job that he had later

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:10%
with General Dynamics, where
he was involved in redesigning

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:10%
the interiors of the P-3
aircraft, which his job, you

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:10%
know, he's a designer.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Basically, he's good with
deciding what should go where.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it was his designs
that were installed

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:90%
on thousands of P-3 aircraft.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.095 align:middle line:84%
And you'd ask, why would we have
thousands of aircraft like this

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:84%
looking for
submarines when there

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:84%
were only 11 Soviet
submarines at the time?

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.036 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, we
were looking for UFOs.

00:09:48.036 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
aggressive program

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to look for undersea bases and
for underwater UFOs, or USOs,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
that he was deeply
involved in, but only

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
in the context of helping make
these airplanes that were doing

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.395 align:middle line:90%
the working, doing looking.

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did Bill
ever inform you

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
about any undersea bases
or the civilizations

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:90%
who may be living there?

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, he emphasized
to me very strongly

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that there were lots of
ways to get to undersea

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:90%
bases, multiple access points.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And there were lots of ways
to go from the water situation

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to underground caverns
that didn't have water.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.675 align:middle line:84%
And also, that they did
do a lot of exploration.

00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
The P-3s, anyway, looked
for underground stuff

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Lakes,
not just in the oceans.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's have a look
at this video from William

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.015 align:middle line:90%
about undersea bases.

00:10:44.015 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM TOMPKINS
(ON VIDEO): I did

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:84%
get hired by General
Dynamics for a Navy program.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And this program was to
locate German submarines,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:90%
anti-submarine warfare program.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about this

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the Navy selected the
Lockheed P-3 patrol bombers

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
to be the air vehicles to locate
German ships and submarines.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the Cold War,
now, and so there

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
was roughly 15
other NATO countries

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
who were using the same
aircraft, the same electronics,

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
the same sensing systems, and
the community communication

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
system, all of it engineered
and designed in US.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the United
States had 120 of these.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And the NATO countries had like
another 60 of them, all out

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:90%
looking for German submarines.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
quite the numbers.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
It's more like we
had 2,000 of these,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and NATO had another 1,000 of
these, not quite that high.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And remember, there were
only 11 Soviet submarines

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:90%
operating at that time.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
There were many of them that
were in training operations,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't tactical.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And so here we got 2,800
P-3 aircraft flying all

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, 24 hours a
day, looking for submarines.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, gee whiz, that's
not exactly what we

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:90%
were doing either.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And there is a title
to the program,

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
which is the mission, ASW,
Anti-Submarine Warfare.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
one which is ASUW.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the U is for
Unidentified extraterrestrials.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this was the
second largest amount

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:35.400 align:middle line:84%
of military money allocated
for a program on the planet.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
It's peacetime, but it's
sort of a war condition.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have all of
these airplanes out.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it became necessary
for a group, which I then

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
was manager of, working
for Data Graphics, which

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
is a subsidiary of
General Dynamics.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I worked
for the corporate office

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and the red team at
the corporate level.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the size
of this program, the number

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:84%
of personnel that
have to be trained

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to fly these aircraft,
the upgrading continually

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of the sensing systems,
the underwater systems,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
of the satellite
system programs that

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.780 align:middle line:84%
were required to be on
board these aircraft,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely unreal.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
What we were really
doing was looking

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
for extraterrestrial
vehicles in the ocean,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and in the large
lakes, and their bases

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
how much money,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
how much time, and how many
people have to be involved

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:90%
in these programs.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And what are you doing?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for
extraterrestrials.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize
what we're saying?

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're looking for
extraterrestrial vehicles

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and bases.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.785 align:middle line:90%
Your Navy is.

00:15:17.785 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Very, very
powerful statement.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you elaborate
on more of what he just said?

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he obviously
spoke of this

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and was included
on those briefings.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.725 align:middle line:84%
What was his direct
position with that?

00:15:31.725 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: His
involvement, physically,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
was doing the process he
described of redesigning

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:90%
the P-3 aircraft.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
actually involved

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in any of the
operations where they

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
actually flew looking for them,
or did he get the results.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But he told me
that we did have--

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:84%
we did find many undersea
access locations.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Where at?

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Could you divulge that?

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I could tell you
there's a giant hole right

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
off of Malibu that
seems to go somewhere.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:84%
You can see a hole, but the
unclassified world has never

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:90%
been able to explore that.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty of what this
program is, that you can do

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:90%
secret stuff and nobody knows.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they ever
find these underwater UFOs?

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I don't have
a vivid recollection.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But my general recollection is
he'd said, yeah, they saw lots,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and yeah, they did
find entrances.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
But he never told me
specifically where or how many.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Bob, did Bill
ever mention anyone

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
seeing or discovering these
lost cities of Atlantis,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
and Bimini, over in Asia?

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:10%
Did he mention anything like
that they saw underwater?

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: No, that's a subject
that we didn't talk about.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:10%
However, we were in
harmony with the idea

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:10%
that many of the civilizations
that were in the caverns

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:10%
were thousands of years old,
and that there might well have

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.124 align:middle line:10%
been relationships to Atlantis.

00:17:16.124 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was not particularly
interested in the history,

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
but he accepted the
idea that our race had

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of history in
parallel with other races

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that were living in these
underground caverns.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:10%
I think that was
this important point

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:10%
is that the history
of Homo sapiens

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:10%
was to be reviewed in
parallel with the history

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.308 align:middle line:10%
of the other races which are not
well defined but we know exist.

00:17:47.308 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he ever
mention anything

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:84%
about under the United States,
we have these huge aquifers

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and caverns.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.030 align:middle line:84%
These are-- you can
basically drive subs

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
through these things from
one coast to the other.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.385 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever mention about
this underwater highway?

00:18:07.385 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I don't remember
an underwater islet,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
but I do remember his
emphasizing the fact

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that our submarines
could go well

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:84%
underneath our continent,
which was a big surprise to me

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, exactly.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Did Bill ever
communicate with you

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:10%
about these underwater bases
and facilities that included

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:10%
these extraterrestrial beings?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Was there any communication?

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Did we live
separately from that?

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Do they just do their
thing, and we do our thing?

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever mention anything?

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The only thing
I realize specifically

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that he mentioned was
in his conversations

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
with his friend, Walter Handel,
that they talked about Borts,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Borts being small aliens
that would come up out

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:90%
of the ground.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And they both seemed to know
about the existence of Borts.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But he never really tried to
define what kind of alien race

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:90%
the Bort was.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear that he was
accepting the fact that there

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
was this small group,
like elves, that

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:90%
lived underground regularly.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think he
even claimed that they

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:90%
came up in Hollywood once.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.820 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Yeah, we've had some
sightings in South America

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:10%
and, of course, in
Northern Africa.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of documentation
I have seen, of course.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I did the tissue harvesting
sampling on the Atacama being

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
from Chile, from
the Atacama Desert.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:10%
So this is something I've
also heard my colleagues speak

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:10%
of these elfin-type beings,
these inner earth beings,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:10%
is what they're
referred to, that

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:10%
have extraterrestrial
lineage, of course,

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:10%
and have been here a
lot longer than we have.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So Hollywood, they're just
popping their heads out

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:90%
of the manhole covers?

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.477 align:middle line:90%
What's going on out there?

00:20:05.477 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
There is an underground
facility there

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.605 align:middle line:90%
that's abandoned right now.

00:20:08.605 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, Bill
lived in Hollywood

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and, as a matter of
fact, his first models

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that made him famous were
displayed in a Hollywood store.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So he was comfortable
talking about Hollywood.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
the location where

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:84%
he and his cousin Walter were
talking about Borts coming out

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.762 align:middle line:90%
of the ground right nearby.

00:20:31.762 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Nearby in
the hills there.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Nearby where
he lived, yeah.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Wow so he had
firsthand experience with this.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, it was,
firsthand experience.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he say
what they looked like?

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.498 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not in detail.

00:20:42.498 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:90%
He did not describe them.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I visualized them as sort
of cylindrical, not--

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
kind of like an alien
I never thought of.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow fascinating.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, speaking of that, one
of Bill Tompkins' earliest

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
influences was being the witness
to the Battle of Los Angeles.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever share
anything about that

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:84%
with you that most people
wouldn't know, like what

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:90%
might have been behind that?

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, the
Battle of Los Angeles

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:84%
is actually one of the
critical points in his life,

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:90%
for several reasons.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's when this
Nordic craft apparently

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:84%
shined a beam of light right on
his house where he was living

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and, quote,
"selected" him, which

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.263 align:middle line:84%
is why he picked the
title "Selected."

00:21:28.263 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do
you mean, the ETs

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:90%
selected Bill with that light?

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well I think Bill
thinks that the ETs selected

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
him to be the person
that they were going

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to deal with over
the next few decades

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:84%
through the Nordic
secretaries he talks about.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:90%
He did not know that, of course.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the Nordics
didn't know either.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, in his
mind, they selected

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:84%
him to be their guy to whom
they were going to help.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
he picked the title "Selected
by Extraterrestrials."

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I
thought about is

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
his report on the Battle
of LA was the fact

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.405 align:middle line:84%
that he's the only person
I've seen and talked to.

00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
several who actually

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
were there, personally, to see
it, including my father-in-law.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But they all say
there was just one

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:90%
craft and a lot of firepower.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But he says there were multiple
crafts, and one of them

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:90%
was a cigar.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.350 align:middle line:90%
So that's very, very different.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.147 align:middle line:84%
It's the only report
I know of where

00:22:33.147 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:90%
he claimed it was a cigar.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were those old
antiaircraft silos still

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:90%
working operation?

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.955 align:middle line:90%
And then what year was this?

00:22:41.955 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: This was 1942.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.015 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So it was.

00:22:44.015 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:84%
They were definitely
operational.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.348 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes, they were.

00:22:46.348 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they were
shooting at these UFOs.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, they were shooting
at apparently only one or maybe

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:90%
two UFOs.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, Bill says
there were multiple UFOs

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:90%
they were shooting at.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But the photograph that was
published in the newspaper

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
the next morning
shows only one UFO

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
with about eight
searchlight beams on it--

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I remember this, yes.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.848 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --and a
half a dozen shells

00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:12.510 align:middle line:90%
exploding in the photograph.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But what he's saying is that
there were multiple craft,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and one of them
was cigar-shaped.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.785 align:middle line:84%
And not only did our
ground base units

00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
use up all our
ammunition, but he

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
said the entire Navy fleet
used up every shell that they

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%
had to shoot them down.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.170 align:middle line:84%
During the Battle of LA,
three things happened.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:84%
One is there were a lot of
things overhead we shot up,

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
shot at.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.115 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is
that one of them

00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:84%
crashed in the San
Bernardino Mountains was

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:90%
recovered by the Army.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And then another one was
recovered by the Navy,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and that was the one that
was taken to Point Mugu

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.663 align:middle line:90%
to be reverse engineered.

00:23:51.663 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there
beings aboard these craft?

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.955 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, we
don't know that.

00:23:54.955 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
That was all top
secret at the time,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and Bill was never
exposed to that.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
The fact that that
was when he got

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.300 align:middle line:84%
selected, and the fact that
there was a cigar shape,

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and there were
lots of vehicles is

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
totally unique, and
different from what

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
people have reported before.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Interesting.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.214 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's have a
look at this video.

00:24:16.214 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM TOMPKINS (ON
VIDEO): February, 1942,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:10%
we were living in a
very large home which

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:10%
had been converted to four
apartments, two upstairs, two

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:10%
down.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.490 align:middle line:84%
We had a great,
big enormous deck

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that ran all the way across this
real high-ceilinged building.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So we were four
blocks from the ocean.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:84%
We can't see the ocean
because it's down low.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:90%
The trees are in the way.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So my brother and I
are laying on our floor

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
listening to the radio and
looking at some papers.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And my dad says, get out
here, out on the deck.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Get out here now.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And we got up, and we
went out to the back deck.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So right above the horizon
of all the trees and stuff,

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and buildings, is this dot,
a white dot just there.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to be some aircraft
flying in to come over and land

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:90%
at the air base.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's not moving.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bright dot.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And off of this dot, to
the left is a little beam.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like a pencil beam,
but you can see it.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
This is out over the ocean,
maybe inside the breakwater?

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we couldn't
see the ocean.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how far out it is.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Could've been 10 miles out.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, what in the world is that?

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're watching it
for about five minutes,

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and then there was a
flash, a brilliant flash--

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:90%
into our eyes.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
It lit up the trees, the
back, the side of the--

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:84%
everything got lit
up, and it went out.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And we looked and
looked and looked,

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
gone, nothing else.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:90%
So we went to bed.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:90%
12:30 at night.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
The antiaircraft
guns started firing.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:10%
What we're talking about is
this fantastic situation,

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:10%
the Los Angeles event,
the Battle of Los Angeles.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
The antiaircraft guns
all started firing.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:90%
[SIREN WAILING]

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
We go outside.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Here is this massive
thing right above us,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:84%
this big, right above
us, maybe 7,000 feet.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:84%
The antiaircraft shells are
blowing up on the bottom of it,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:90%
all around it.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
There's eight searchlights
all focused on this

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:90%
as they're shooting at it.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
nothing is happening.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And it parks there for
an hour and a half.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
While it's parked, hundreds of
different types of vehicles,

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
most of them circular, but
some cigar shape, large ones,

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:90%
came under underneath.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
We were being fired on,
where they're still trying

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:90%
to shoot this thing down.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:90%
They came around them.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
They came over them,
till all night long.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Now it got boring after a while,
so we went to bed at 3 o'clock.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how it gets boring.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:90%
We went to bed at 3 o'clock.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Now when it started,
everybody came outside.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.575 align:middle line:84%
All of us were standing
there watching this event.

00:27:44.575 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Now what was not published
was that the breakwater

00:27:55.690 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%
is full of Navy
ships who used up

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:84%
all of their ammunition
that five-hour period,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
not just the coast
artillery, who used up

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:90%
all of their ammunition.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Your whole two Pacific
Navies, the Eastern Navy

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and the Western Navy, used
up all their ammunition.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
They finally quit, of
course, just before daylight.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:30.110 align:middle line:90%
and everybody went back inside.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:10%
But from the standpoint of all
of us out there watching this,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.340 align:middle line:10%
nobody got a heart attack.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody got sick.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Nobody got scared.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Nobody got frightened.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of
the planet, London

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
was being bombed by the
Germans, and they're

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:90%
trying to get into shelters.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:84%
We had a five-hour war, except
they didn't shoot at us.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.530 align:middle line:90%
But nobody got sick.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The only persons who
were actually wounded

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:90%
was from shrapnel.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
A couple of guys
actually were killed.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Almost a million
people in California

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:84%
watched an event for five hours
of a massive extraterrestrial

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:32.318 align:middle line:84%
battle group that came over
California with a mission.

00:29:32.318 --> 00:29:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Bill
mentions in the video

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.832 align:middle line:84%
that this craft was there
for over five hours.

00:29:37.832 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But he also
mentioned-- and I never

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.420 align:middle line:84%
heard this before--
multiple craft

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.423 align:middle line:84%
were surrounding and flying
around the main craft.

00:29:45.423 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.298 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, that's one of
the things that's totally

00:29:49.298 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%
unique about his testimony.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I have heard other people
who were there report

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.168 align:middle line:90%
seeing all the shells go off.

00:29:58.168 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were more
interested in the shells

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.180 align:middle line:90%
than what they were shooting at.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The video image showed
craft sort of slithering by,

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and it showed lots of them to
be consistent with his words.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But I'm perfectly happy
to accept Bill's words

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:90%
that there were multiple ones.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
comment on his opinion

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that somehow the aliens
didn't want us to stay awake

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
or they're putting us
to sleep at the end.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.285 align:middle line:84%
I talked to one person, who was
a very close friend of mine,

00:30:36.285 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:84%
who at that time
was watching it.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.398 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I got out of bed at
noon when the shooting started.

00:30:41.398 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
watched for two hours.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I got bored and
went back to bed.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
So it was as simple as that.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.375 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that's
kind of comical.

00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:49.175 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: [LAUGHS]

00:30:49.175 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, something
so extreme as this,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could only
watch a war for so long.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.403 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:30:55.403 --> 00:30:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or maybe it
was something else.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was
some energy put out,

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and those people just
kind of got bored with it,

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:84%
because that left
their whole West Coast

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:90%
defenseless after that day--

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --you know,
until they could

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.087 align:middle line:84%
get restocked logistically
with all their supplies.

00:31:08.087 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, I think that's
a surprising part of Bill's

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
testimony, that the
Navy actually fired off

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.090 align:middle line:84%
all their ammunition too, and
that that was probably not

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:90%
reported to the president.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.445 align:middle line:84%
They only reported the ones
from the ground artillery.

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it probably
wasn't reported because it

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:84%
could've got intercepted, and
the enemy would have known also

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.160 align:middle line:90%
that we were--

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
had our shields down on
that side of the coast.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The American
people, at that time,

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.120 align:middle line:84%
were very nervous about the
Japanese attacking the West

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Coast.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.533 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they did attack
the West Coast, as I recall.

00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:90%
I forget exactly when, but--

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Up north, right,
by Alaska, I think?

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the submarine came up
and fired a bunch of rounds.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you
notice the stories

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:84%
from other people
kind of coincided

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
with what William
Tompkins was saying?

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they're
consistent in the sense

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:03.025 align:middle line:84%
that everybody kind of got bored
after a couple of hours of it.

00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
watch the next two hours.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.983 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bob, thanks
for being here,

00:32:07.983 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
sharing all the experiences
of Bill Tompkins with us

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:90%
today on "Cosmic Disclosure."

I'm Emery Smith.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching.
