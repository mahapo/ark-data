>>EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we're with Tim,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor from Germany
who analyzes and suggests

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
various strategies in relation
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Captain Randy Cramer,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:10%
who claims to be the public
spokesperson for the United

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

>>EMERY: We're going to have
a really intriguing episode

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
today, talking about bases
and beings in Antarctica.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So Tim, let's start with you.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
What do you know
about Antarctica

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
bases and beings there

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and some of the history?

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, so my
knowledge about Antarctica

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
is from documents, and
it ends kind of-- it's

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in the 1960s.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So Germany in the 1930s, 1920s,
they were really interested

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:90%
in the--

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:90%
now called UAP phenomenon.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
It was then the Germans
at that time had missions.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
They went to India, to
different other parts, Tibet,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing all
this esoteric research,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
which was kind of popular
at that time in Germany.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Much more popular than
anywhere else in the world.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And they came to the
conclusion that before there

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of major
magnetic pole shift, different

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:90%
continents looked differently.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were assuming
that Antarctica

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
had been some kind of continent
with a much milder climate

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and having an
extraterrestrial race

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that lived there and
originated there.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of
interesting to them.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons to go
to Antarctica in order to,

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
A, find whatever's left
there, and B, place a basis.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And the documents say and
state that especially the SS

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
had some departments that
were doing research on UFOs.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
We know the story about this.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The British called
them foo fighters,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
appearing everywhere in the
Second World War scenario.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And Admiral Donitz at that time,
he got the task from Hitler

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to build a basis down in
Antarctica, which he did.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And they went there.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
It was especially the
SS that was doing that.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:90%
The Germans also sent some--

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
the so-called
Schwabenlander, which

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.530 align:middle line:84%
was a ship, the only aircraft
carrier at that time.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Had some aircrafts on it so
they could explore Antarctica.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But especially the SS did a
lot of ground work down there.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And at some time when the
end of the war was coming

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and it was expectable
that Germany

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.455 align:middle line:84%
was going to lose the
war, at least in Europe,

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and Germany could not be saved
anymore, Himmler himself,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.125 align:middle line:84%
he had built kind of the first
breakaway nation ever occurred

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:90%
in the modern times.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Because he was actually second
man in the state after Hitler,

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
but he kept all the technology
for himself and the SS.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of built the
first black budget programs

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
at that time and tried to ship
everything down to Antarctica.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.760 align:middle line:84%
The Americans have
some of the submarines.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:90%
They have found them.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They also found material
for the nuclear bomb, which

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:90%
seems to be a German invention.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have
worked on that.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Also, a lot of
scientists from that time

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
were pretty deep in
the nuclear research.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
From that, I guess the American
nuclear program emerged.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they went,
putting people down there.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I also think that
from everything

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
that I've gone through
that Heinrich Himmler--

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
the Americans seem to
have not caught him.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a photograph
which shows

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
some dead on the ground,
which kind of looks

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
a little bit like Himmler.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Also put the famous glasses
on his eyes and dead body.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
The story is that Himmler
died in the interview.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
He killed himself while all
the other military people

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:90%
are interrogating him.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So the documents seem
to say that Himmler

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
took his chance to
escape from Germany,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
put everything and all the
technology on the K-class

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
submarines, brought
it to Antarctica.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Hitler in his last days
got the information,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:90%
that something was going on.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:84%
In his last will, he
was super furious.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
In his last will, he ordered to
have Himmler killed, actually.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's where the story went.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what I read.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many people were
actually shipped over there

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.568 align:middle line:90%
to Antarctica, would you say?

00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, interesting.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans had a
mission and a program

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.772 align:middle line:84%
where they were systematically
looking for orphans.

00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Orphans, yeah.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.605 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, orphans.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:90%
So people who have no family.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
There was a program where
they artificially tried

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:90%
to raise children for Germany.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
They took those,
because they actually

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:90%
have nothing to relate to.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And they sent them
down there as well as

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of therapists
and psychologists.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Mostly females.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:90%
So you have a lot of--

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is that?

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Why is that?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So the documents seem
to say that there's

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
some kind of portal or
something that extremely changes

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:90%
the perception of reality.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And they needed stable
people down there,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
so they put all those female
therapists and psychologists

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
onto those ships and
submarines in order

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.407 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the sanity
of the personnel.

00:06:51.407 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, most
of the people think

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
it's a polar cap, so how did
they get in there, number one?

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And how did they form and
get all the people in?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So they seem to have used
a special class of submarines,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
which uses special
state-of-the-art technology

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
at that time in order
to go very, very deep.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it was almost
double the depth

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:90%
of a conventional submarine.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It was inside the so-called
Fuhrer Convoy, which

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:90%
was the collector of the class.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
They use that to transport
material, technology

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So from the documents, they went
down there, carved something,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
kind of created a sub
climate, so it's not

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:90%
freezing cold in there.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.217 align:middle line:90%
Just like maybe an igloo.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.175 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like an igloo.

00:07:48.175 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:90%
So they built upon that.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Randy, what
do you think about that?

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:84%
How did they terraform,
transform that area

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.135 align:middle line:90%
underneath the ice caps?

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Yeah,
my understanding,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:90%
that's basically correct.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ice shelves
are 1,000 feet thick.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.298 align:middle line:84%
So to get under
them, at the time,

00:08:08.298 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
you would have had to
have a submarine that

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
could go 800, 900, over 1,000
feet deep, which at the time

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:90%
would be ridiculously deep.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And then came up in what
were natural ice caves.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, caverns that had sort
of hollowed out a little bit.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And then used steam
to just make them

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:90%
as big as they needed to be.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And then if you've got a--

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:84%
imagine you come underneath
into an ice cave,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and you steam out the cave so
it's got a 100-foot ceiling

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's several
hundred feet wide.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ice structure
of the whole thing

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.937 align:middle line:90%
would keep it from collapsing.

00:08:42.937 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:90%
It would be like an igloo.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like 60 degrees in
there, or something like that.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be out of the wind
and the subzero temperatures

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and the stuff that kills people
up on the surface, for sure.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So why Antarctica?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So to my
understanding, there's

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
something about the polars
of this planet which

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:90%
makes Antarctica interesting.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I think in the first place,
they thought of Antarctica

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:90%
being the lost continent.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And that raised the
question, what's down there,

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and what can we do with it?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And also, they
needed a place where

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:84%
they could build a base that
is basically unconquerable.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So lots and lots and
lots of technology

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that they went through in World
War II they brought down there.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:84%
They took the time
and the position

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that they have there
in order to build it,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:90%
to restructure, and finalize it.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, everyone can
look up things on Wikipedia.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:10%
They will see that there's this
Admiral Byrd incident where

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:10%
the US brought a lot of material
and personnel down there,

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:10%
and they had this encounter
with those flying machines.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You said earlier
that the Germans were

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
going down there because
of not only that,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:84%
but because of an
extraterrestrial existence.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate on,
how did they know that?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, what are
these flying machines,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and who is operating them?

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So they were
doing lots and lots

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:84%
of research in
esoteric terms and also

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial technology
back in the 1920s, 1930s.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Basically, there seems to
have been some kind of species

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.665 align:middle line:90%
that once was there.

00:10:38.665 --> 00:10:39.465 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you know something,
Randy, who was down there.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be way
back, way back.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ancient times.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.145 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Very ancient times.

00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right So who
were flying these craft?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying the Germans
were doing alien reproduction

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:84%
vehicles, or was this
from the species there?

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can elaborate
on this little war we had

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:90%
down there, this little attack.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
what happened there.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I know that those
craft that they built,

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.384 align:middle line:84%
the documents seem to say
that people can get in there.

00:11:18.384 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
They made them-- they
could operate them.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, it seems
that they have perfected

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:90%
the weaponry on those craft.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I have no proof
to whether Germany

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
was in contact to any
non-terrestrial species

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:90%
or not at that time.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I assume, because World
War II is so important,

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and we know that there was
presence all over the place,

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
observing what's
happening, that I

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:84%
mean, it would be
logical that any

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of the species that
show some invasive,

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
directive characteristica, that
they would contact Germany.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.195 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you know something?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: A little.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell us about
that whole conflict

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:90%
that was going on there.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So it was called
Operation High Jump.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So the mission
itself was supposed

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:90%
to take three or four months.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:90%
They get down there.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Heavy losses.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Have to turn around and come
back within three weeks.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
According to the interview
that was done in--

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:84%
it was Argentina newspaper,
magazine that interviewed

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Admiral Byrd after that.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.373 align:middle line:84%
And he said something
to the effect of,

00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to alarm
anyone, but the next war

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
will be fought by vehicles
that can go from pole to pole

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:90%
at extreme speeds.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a famous quote.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So essentially what we
understand happened there,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
they went down prepared
with what we had.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Some things popped
out of the water,

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
cut one of the
battleships in half,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and essentially
did so much damage

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.798 align:middle line:84%
in about minutes that
they were-- oh, we

00:12:58.798 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
don't know if we can keep doing
this, and had to turn around.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was another incident
that occurred with that.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
There was an air
crew of a plane that

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
was sent to fly over Antarctica
to take a look at it.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a flight crew that
was all from Oklahoma.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.612 align:middle line:84%
And there was sort
of a mysterious crash

00:13:17.612 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
or the vehicle
failed or something.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty sure they were
shot right out of the sky.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a report on that,
but of course, it was, oops.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:90%
We had an accident.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:84%
This poor crew-- it was all
guys from Oklahoma-- died there.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But we're pretty sure that that
was also in line with that.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So we know that somebody
knew something and had

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
the hints and the rumors that
there was something down there.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
What everybody knew at the
time, I can't say for sure.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But the goal was hopefully,
let's get down there quick

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
before they've really
established themselves

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and they've got any kind
of military buildup.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:90%
But they had just enough ships.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Only takes a couple of ships
with a death ray or a particle

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:90%
beam to fight a 1940s Navy ship.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:90%
So it didn't go very well.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So to my
knowledge, the Americans,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:84%
they have detected
some of the submarines

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.675 align:middle line:84%
before they could
enter Antarctica?

00:14:11.675 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And the Russians,
they came in a little later.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
They had the information
a little later.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:90%
They came to Berlin.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.670 align:middle line:90%
They found all those documents.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And there were things
about an Antarctica,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they
gained knowledge.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if there was alien
or non-terrestrial presence

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:90%
in Germany at that time?

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I mean, there's
just what we've heard or got

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
from the intel that
we got that was

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
a combination of some people
from the Thule Society

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and some of the different
esoteric SS Nazi types who

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
were working together,
who were establishing

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
a protocol similar to actually
what Aleister Crowley was doing

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
with Jack Parsons and
another friend of his.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting
sort of parallel

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:90%
in two very different ways.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So they were using basic psionic
telepathy to communicate,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:90%
get information.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:90%
But they were practical.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:90%
They were like, all right.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Give me some-- I want to
know how to build a rocket.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.577 align:middle line:90%
I want rocket fuel equations.

00:15:14.577 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I want-- they got very specific,
because these were scientists

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:84%
who were asking the
questions, and ended up

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.695 align:middle line:84%
getting some very
forthcoming information.

00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:84%
We feel there's some
vagueness about that,

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
because as we have
understood over decades,

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
just because someone shows up
and says, I'm an Andromedan

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
or I'm a Pleiadian doesn't
mean that they are.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It means they say that they
are, and maybe someone reports

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
that they are, but
that might not actually

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.148 align:middle line:84%
be either where they're from
or what they were doing.

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have that
vague information,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:90%
but there were certainly--

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so sure that they had a
physical presence on the ground

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
at that point or that, like what
happened later on after World

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
War II where we had ET
engineers and scientists helping

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
the Russians and Soviets
at the time, and helping us

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and other countries.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.447 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that they
had that at the time.

00:16:00.447 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I would almost suspect
if they did that they

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:90%
would have made more progress.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I don't know it either.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It seems like most of what
they were working with

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
was still materials limitations,
mid-20th century industry,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:84%
electronic equipment
limitations.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So there didn't seem
to get any of the leaps

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that we got when the ET
scientists came later and were

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, no, no, no, no.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Your materials are all wrong.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.035 align:middle line:90%
Your electronics are all wrong.

00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:31.867 align:middle line:84%
You need fiber optics and alloys
and lightweight materials.

00:16:31.867 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And so my understanding
is they didn't

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.908 align:middle line:84%
have any of that
at the time, which

00:16:34.908 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is why most of the vehicles
were like flying tanks.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:84%
They weren't very
maneuverable and very agile.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell me about the
land part under the ice.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:90%
When was that discovered?

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And was there extraterrestrial
life there when

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
they discovered it?

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
there's actually always

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:90%
been exposed land in Antarctica.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So the first expeditions
that ever went there,

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
the farther inland
they got, they

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
found natural water
sources that were not

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:84%
frozen with fresh water,
rocky plateaus that

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:90%
were not covered with ice.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's always been
some exposed area there,

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and especially as
you get farther down.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding,
after the incident

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:84%
that occurred
about a decade ago,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
we did send Marines to
secure the situation.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So as a Marine
Corps officer, I do

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
have to be a little
careful to not

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
say anything that could
endanger a Marine's

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.027 align:middle line:90%
well-being in that situation.

00:17:31.027 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do my best to
answer the questions in full

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
that I can, but if I
look like I'm pausing,

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
it's because I want to make
sure I'm not saying something--

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.963 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure, sure.

00:17:37.963 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: But what
I can say, there's

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
been an archaeological
dig there for decades.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So they finally found
something that was important,

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
a very large chamber that was
the size of a football field,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, it was filled
with stasis pods that

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
were anywhere from a meter,
three feet in length,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:90%
to over 30 feet in length.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: [EXHALE]

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So my
understanding was,

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:84%
because some of
the schwabenlanders

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
are still down there,
their inclination

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:90%
was this could be a biohazard.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.302 align:middle line:84%
We need to burn this to
the ground immediately.

00:18:16.302 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there were some
going, no, no, no, no.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:90%
This could be really important.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:90%
This is an archaeological site.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.312 align:middle line:90%
We can't just burn it down.

00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
we had to deploy

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
some Marines to make
sure they didn't just

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:90%
torch the whole thing.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And from what we seem to
understand about this,

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.475 align:middle line:84%
this was probably one of the
oldest intergalactic space

00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
ports on the planet, is
the one at Antarctica.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
We think that most
of these stasis pods

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.350 align:middle line:84%
contain the teleoperational,
biological bodies

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
for the personnel who
were stationed there.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:84%
As we have come to practice
and understand in the work

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that we do, you
don't always want

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to take a person, their
actual physical, biological,

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.192 align:middle line:84%
bacterial, exposed
person, and put them

00:19:00.192 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:84%
in a different environment
and bring them back.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, teleoperation
of either mechanical drones

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:84%
or biological drones turns out
to be one of the most efficient

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:90%
things to do.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Because worst case
scenario, you can just

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.142 align:middle line:84%
throw the drone in an
incinerator and burn it,

00:19:14.142 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and then it's not going
to bring anything back.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But apparently,
ETs have been doing

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
this for a long, long, long time
before we ever learned about it

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:90%
or started doing it.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So it would make sense
knowing that that any

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
of the personnel who were
there, so that they wouldn't

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
be bringing contaminants
back and forth,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:90%
would teleoperate a body.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And that for some reason, they
left them there in stasis pods

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
in case of some kind of
a later activation date.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So what we've been finding is
as we expose more thick ice,

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:84%
in some cases
you've got hundreds

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:84%
or 1,000 feet more of
ice on top of this stuff,

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:84%
we're finding ships
that are intact.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We're finding ships
that are in pieces.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
We're finding dead
bodies, corpses,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:90%
things frozen in the ice.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:84%
There seems to have been
an event which occurred.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why they had
to shut the base down.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
There was some kind of
a catastrophic calamity

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that, based on the
damage that we're seeing,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
we don't know from the data that
we're looking at yet whether it

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a natural occurrence
or an unnatural occurrence,

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
because someone can use
technology that makes

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
it look like an earthquake
or a natural occurrence

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:90%
or hurricane, tornado, whatever.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So what I understand,
they're doing

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.092 align:middle line:84%
the work of piecing all that
stuff together and trying

00:20:32.092 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
all of the information

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
means while there's some
competition, as always,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
over securing
technology, information,

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
or keeping technology
and information falling

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:84%
into an opponent's hands that
you don't want to since we're

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
not always friends.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:84%
There's often cooperation
for collective interest

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
while still competing
and spying and getting

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
ready to stab each other
in the back, and so forth.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was in
these stasis tubes?

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Like I
said, perfectly--

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Preserved.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --perfectly
preserved biological bodies

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that if something were to
animate it or teleoperate it,

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
it would probably pop right up
and move around, because they

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:90%
weren't decayed, decomposing.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
They were perfectly healthy
cells in perfect stasis.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.693 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Do your people
know what species--

00:21:22.693 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
like I said, we've

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
got pods anywhere from a
meter to about 30 feet.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding is they've
identified no less than three

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.425 align:middle line:90%
or four dozen different species.

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
It was a straight
up cross-sectional,

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic cooperative
base where everyone

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:90%
was playing and participating.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like
one or two species.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.028 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely a
collective galactic operation.

00:21:47.028 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Which, from what we understand,
most of the space ports

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
like that, everyone uses
them so that everyone

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
can come and go and make use of
resources, materials, whatever

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:90%
else they're doing here.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interesting.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there any
energy signatures there

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:84%
like portals or other
energy signatures

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.490 align:middle line:84%
from still operating craft
or still operating buildings?

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.705 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:12.705 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
We did find some
operational jump gates.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
A couple of them, from
what I understand,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:84%
they sent some drones through
that didn't come back,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and they decided not to send
actual personnel through.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
is they blew them up.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
They were just
like, no, we've got

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to blow this up and
make sure that nothing

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:90%
comes through here.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.272 align:middle line:84%
Because you send
something through a portal

00:22:32.272 --> 00:22:35.343 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't come back to
you, it's usually a bad sign.

00:22:35.343 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
My understanding, there
was a few functional ones.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And who knows where they go to?

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But probably whoever was
using that ship or that place

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.913 align:middle line:84%
had a jump gate that went
back to their home world

00:22:45.913 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
or something, or maybe to a
mothership somewhere far away.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Hard to say.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So in 2015, about
every world leader and also

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
religious leader had
visited Antarctica.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And do you have
any information--

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.285 align:middle line:84%
what was so
important about that?

00:23:02.285 --> 00:23:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't think I
have all the information,

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
but I can tell you what I know.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
that at the time,

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:90%
the local commander of the--

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
Naval base or Naval

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:84%
station right there that's
been doing ice digging

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:90%
samples for however long.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty sure it was
the base commander there

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:84%
who invited these
people a little outside

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.265 align:middle line:84%
of the chain of command
of his authority to do so.

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] So everyone came.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
because someone--

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
when commanders sometimes
overstep their bounds,

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily because
they're doing the wrong thing.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It means that someone maybe--

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
they didn't get the advice
on the psychological impact

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.968 align:middle line:84%
of people who haven't been
briefed or conditioned

00:23:51.968 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:90%
about some of the things.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:90%
We find that in the--

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:84%
whenever standard soldiers,
standard personnel,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
standard government
personnel have encounters,

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:84%
you have these high,
high, high percentages

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
of people who panic, go
into states of shock.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think from
what I understand,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
the base commander invited some
people down ahead of a game

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:84%
plan without making
sure that everyone

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.543 align:middle line:84%
had been cleared or prepared
or without a proper briefing.

00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And then was like,
here, I'm going

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to show you some cool
stuff, and you're all

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.495 align:middle line:90%
going to be really excited.

00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were, but some
of them were shocked.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.578 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were frightened.

00:24:27.578 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And some of them didn't
handle it as well

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:90%
as they thought that it would.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: What did they see?

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm not sure
what they showed--

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what
he showed them.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, based on,
again, what we know

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:84%
is there and the
archaeological dig,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a ton of information
and a ton of whatever they've

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:90%
got going on there.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So he obviously felt that it
was important for these people

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
to see it, but I don't think
it was through the chain

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:90%
of command that he did that.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it was he decided
to do it on his own.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know whether he got
moved to a new job after that.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Probably.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So one thing
that is significant

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
about Antarctica is that we have
this Antarctica contract that

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
makes it kind of a
neutral zone for everyone.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And every big nation has
their bases down there.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:90%
The Russians are doing--

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
digging huge holes in there,
putting all those cameras

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:90%
And they are finding something.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So there is an enormous
importance about Antarctica.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.528 align:middle line:84%
We just do not know
what is down there.

00:25:31.528 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now there are
some intelligence officers

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that we have spoke to
that say if we would

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
come forward and say
what is in Antarctica,

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these people
will get killed

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:90%
for going public with it.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you,
what is in Antarctica?

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: [LAUGHS]

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Well, sure.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll answer that in two parts.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:84%
First part is for
decades, we've had issues

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
where depending on who
you are and what you say

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and whether you're
cleared or allowed or not,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:84%
whether you disappear,
die in a car accident,

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:90%
commit suicide in a hotel room.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:90%
So it wouldn't be--

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:84%
we have a history of making
certain people disappear

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:90%
for saying certain things.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not, it has to do

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
with whether that person
really should be the person

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to say that.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So certain people
could say something

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
about aliens or UFOs,
UAPs over the years.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Nothing could happen to them.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Certain military
intelligence, scientists,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:84%
astronomers say something,
their lab gets burned down

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and they disappear.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's always been an
inconsistency with who gets

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:84%
punished for saying
something and who doesn't.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of those
situations where, yeah, it's

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:90%
delicate.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
happening down there that

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.325 align:middle line:84%
could tip the sway
of panic in the world

00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:84%
if too much information
was to come out

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:84%
too quickly or to shock
people in a certain way.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:84%
We think that information
should come out

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:84%
rather than it be kept
secret, but we also

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
understand that you don't
just want to go, blah!

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And scare the crap
out of people.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when you talk
about places on the planet

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and old archaeological
sites or old space ports,

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:84%
this is probably the biggest
one, the oldest one, which

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:84%
means it's got
the most materials

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to go through and look at
and the most square footage

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.350 align:middle line:90%
to go through and look at.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn, the older
something is, the more likely

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:84%
you've got that one in
100 chance that you're

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:84%
going to find that real rare
item of technology or something

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that is like, oh, I found
the most amazing thing,

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
or you get the Rosetta Stone
or sort of the equivalent of it

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:90%
by getting it first.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So any time there's
old stuff, it's

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
like, you want to go check
that out and grab it.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, like the UFO soft
disclosure they're doing now,

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was
something recently

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in the media about finding a
civilization in Antarctica.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was not everywhere
published, but it is out there.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So I see that as a soft
disclosure of getting things

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
out there, besides the
point of them running down

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.010 align:middle line:84%
there and pillaging everything
and putting Egyptian stuff down

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:84%
there and mine stuff there to
confuse the poor scientists

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:90%
that do go in there.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead, Tim.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:90%
What do you have?

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:90%
What's your take?

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, Randy, have
you interacted with the ice

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Germans in any way?

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: No, not that I'm
personally aware of, no.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:84%
The only interactions
that I've had

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
would be meetings where
I've had to be present

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they were present,
but I've never sat down,

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:84%
chatted with them, had
a beer or anything.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So do you know
anything about their military

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:84%
down there, their
agendas or something?

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I know a little
bit about some of their ships

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and how they're
designed, and I've

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
talked to a couple of people
who've served in the service

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.143 align:middle line:84%
there, and so have told me
some things about the tech

00:29:07.143 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:90%
and the stuff that they use.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Can't verify all of the
things that I've heard,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:84%
so I wouldn't repeat
a bunch of them.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:18.098 align:middle line:90%
But they've-- I--

00:29:18.098 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Do you want to share it?

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't want to
offend you when I say this,

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.195 align:middle line:84%
but they've taken a very German
approach to doing things.

00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:24.346 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I don't feel very
German, so I'm OK with that.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So the ships are very
heavy duty, they're very thick,

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:84%
they're very hard,
they're very solid.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:90%
But they're not as fast.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:90%
They're not as maneuverable.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We tend to want to have
something that's much quicker.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They want things that are
really durable and solid.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Do they still
use the swastika?

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, absolutely.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Now from what I've seen,
there is another uniform

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that they do wear sometimes
that's a toned down thing.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And you literally have
to look at the patch

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:84%
to see where the little
teeny swastika in the patch

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
is so that it's not blazingly
in front of everybody.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to say,
no, we're not really Nazis,

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:90%
but we are.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So they put a little teeny
one on the patch there.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple different
uniforms that they've used.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.177 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's current.

00:30:18.177 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So with the climate
change, it getting warmer,

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:26.100 align:middle line:84%
how does that affect Antarctica
and some of the things

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that are there that
will be exposed?

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.892 align:middle line:10%
>>CRAMER: Well, from what I
understand, there's already

00:30:29.892 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:10%
a pyramid that's
been exposed by that,

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.660 align:middle line:10%
that some pictures
have been taken of.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:10%
It's just going to expose
everything at some point.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:10%
So at some point, whatever's
under all of that ice

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:10%
is going to melt
away, and it's just

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:10%
going to be out there in plain
view for everyone to see.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those
things, you could only

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.482 align:middle line:84%
keep it a secret for
so long at this point.

00:30:49.482 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that they're going

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to keep it a secret until
the whole thing's melted,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
but at some point, we're going
to be able to see it all.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I did here of a craft
that is sticking out of the ice

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:84%
quite dramatically
that they're trying

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:84%
to hide on Google Earth
and other imagery,

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.230 align:middle line:84%
using three-dimensional
imagery and stuff

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:90%
and trying to cover it up.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you know about this?

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:10%
So recently, there
was a photograph

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.300 align:middle line:10%
of what they're calling
an ice ship that

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:10%
looks like a boat that's
been frozen in the water.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:10%
My understanding is that
they changed that, so instead

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.700 align:middle line:10%
of it looking just like a
cylinder tube on the ground,

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:10%
they made it look like an
icebreaker or something that's

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, my understanding
is that's literally

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
something sticking up out of the
ice that is not an icebreaker.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not an actual
seaworthy vessel.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And also, a scientific
team did discover

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:84%
flying over this giant crevasse,
this hole in the ground.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, there is
a hole at the South Pole

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and there's one
at the North Pole.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:10%
So the one at the
South Pole is the one

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:10%
that people know the least
about or probably have

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.625 align:middle line:10%
seen the least of.

00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:84%
The northern one is the
one in which old sailors,

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:84%
when they would talk
about approaching

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:84%
the edge of the
world and would see

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:84%
this long edge of the
ocean falling down

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:84%
into nowhere, well,
it's big enough

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that if you're on a boat, you
can't see end to end, right?

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So it would seem like
it stretches endlessly,

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.958 align:middle line:90%
It just goes in a big circle.

00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
is that the water

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:84%
underneath the ocean,
which according to NASA

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.870 align:middle line:84%
has more water than
the oceans have.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's more water on
the planet under the oceans

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:90%
than we have in the oceans.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Just try to grasp
that for a second.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And that there's essentially
a recycling process.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.512 align:middle line:84%
So as water at the north
falls down into the hole,

00:32:40.512 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:84%
it goes down into
the bottom, which

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:84%
then just pushes
back up in the oceans

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and balances out
the water levels.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But all the drawings and
so forth from sailors back

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:84%
in the old days saying, it's
the end of the world, nope.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.993 align:middle line:84%
That was the hole at
the North Pole, which

00:32:54.993 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle of the water as
opposed to the one in the South

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Pole that is in the
middle of a landmass.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, they're
the most direct ways

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to get to the Agarthan Network
is through those holes.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Not saying that
they're not guarded,

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.842 align:middle line:84%
you can just go down there
without someone saying,

00:33:08.842 --> 00:33:10.050 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing down here?

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But those are, my understanding,
the most direct access points,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:84%
which is why the base was
built down at that point,

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:84%
right next to it
so that there was

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.330 align:middle line:84%
an easy in and out between
the species and the Agarthan

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Network and the
base on the surface,

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and whatever was happening
on the surface at the time.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:90%
It was so long ago.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.020 align:middle line:84%
My understanding, like,
400,000, 500,000 years ago.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Maybe longer.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: As we wind
up this episode, Tim,

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:37.020 align:middle line:84%
please tell us the significance
of the Germans basically

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.130 align:middle line:84%
discovering Antarctica and
building up Antarctica,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.510 align:middle line:90%
some of the first people.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I had a conversation
with other species,

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
significance of Germans

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:84%
for the evolution
of the universe.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And we could agree
upon that Germans,

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
because of their significance
for the timeline of the world,

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:84%
they kind of have their
own karmic healing to do,

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.659 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
play a role in order

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:84%
to bring this chaos
of the timeline,

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution of humanity
in some helpful order

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:90%
in some way or another.

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So Germans seem to be a nation
or a group of people that

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:84%
actually had a very profound
connection to nature

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and a super high
spiritual potency.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And in those conversations
that I have with other beings,

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is the way
Germans have to come back

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:84%
to that, to feel their
connectivity to the world

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and play a significant part
in the spiritual evolution

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.510 align:middle line:90%
of this world.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is a task
that they need

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.328 align:middle line:84%
to do at one point or
another spiritually.

00:35:00.328 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, how fascinating.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that as well,
because the extraterrestrials

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and the Germans were some of
the first contact, you know?

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.430 align:middle line:90%
And they picked the Germans.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: At least in modern times.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.560 align:middle line:90%
In modern times.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And I also
think that there

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of potency to the
World War in terms of energy

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that could go in
the right direction.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:84%
If you see the swastika
and its actual meaning

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
of being children of the
sun in some way or another,

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that is something that
might be the first idea

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and the foundation
of what could heal

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that emotional and spiritual
path from the past.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you, Tim,
and thank you, Randy,

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:90%
for being on the show today.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.292 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Thanks for having me.

00:35:55.292 --> 00:35:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.530 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.437 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: Next on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:36:04.437 --> 00:36:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY: So what
we were trying to do

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is open a portal in the fabric
of space in order to travel.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Germany was probably the
first nation in modern history

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:84%
that had experiments
on time travel.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Their approach was to use high
voltage in order to melt down

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.920 align:middle line:90%
the fabric of space.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I said, no,
where were you born?

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.420 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's very difficult
to explain because I was born

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:90%
1,000 years into the future.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:90%
I came back in time.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:90%
We didn't open up a time portal.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.340 align:middle line:90%
We opened up a dimension.
