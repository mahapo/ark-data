>> Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we're with Tim,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor
to covert analysts,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:10%
trying to understand the
missions and strategies

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:10%
of non-human intelligences
on our planet.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Tim.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Contact scenarios are
happening around the world,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Tim.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:90%
How widespread is this?

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a good
question, Emery.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So we very conservatively
estimated the numbers

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
of contact scenarios
at around 30,000

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
per year, which is
probably very much

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
less than the
actual numbers were

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
in the high times of
contact scenarios.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
conservative number.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And we also think that
contact scenarios do not

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:90%
take place once in a lifetime.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
But people that get contacted
will get contacted frequently

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lives.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So while this number of
30,000 cases per year,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
it's very conservatively
put, we think

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that there could
potentially be millions

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:84%
of cases around the world that
basically have collectible,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:84%
memorized ideas of
what happened, or not.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
They might not
even remember that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
but this seemed to be a
mass phenomenon right now.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.225 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what races are involved
and what's their motivation?

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We do know that several
races do contact work that way.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
We do know that some
reptilian races do it.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
We do know that some
of the humanoid races--

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Pleiades, Andromeda-- that
those races are doing it.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But we also found a
very interesting fact,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and that is that the Greys
are doing an extensive amount

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:90%
of contact scenarios.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And they are not only
doing it for their own race

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:90%
and their own hybrid children.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But they have also been
contracted by other races

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.295 align:middle line:90%
in order to do the job for them.

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Greys are a
fiber-constructed body,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
how do they become
hybrids with human tissue?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Greys are pretty
much masters in genetics.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is they have
all these programs going

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
on where they collect
different genetic strains,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
different genetics
that they could apply

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:90%
onto different other species.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So while they are not
capable of, let's say,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
natural reproduction,
they are very well capable

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:84%
of altering and
modifying genetic strains

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.425 align:middle line:84%
in potentially every
species around the universe.

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Who are the other species
that the Greys are involved

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
with that are taking this
abduction to another level?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they just
do it themselves?

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so basically, their
services stands open for every

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
species throughout the
universe that contracts them.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So they do not exclude certain
species from their service.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So basically, every species that
has a certain operative mission

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
can contact the Greys
and use their services.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
They proved pretty much
professional in what they do.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:90%
So they do it a lot.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And they have the
technology that

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
is necessary to do
these kinds of missions.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So that might be a reason why
a species contacts the Greys

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:90%
instead of doing it themselves.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's about resources.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when a
species has their offspring

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:84%
on a certain planet,
which basically happens

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
on Earth-- so we have a lot
of hybrids going on here--

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:84%
they want to make sure
of that those hybrids,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
that they know where
they are, that they

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
can get in contact with them
whatever time they want.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:84%
But they might not have
enough personnel in the area.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They might be engaged
somewhere else.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
They might not even be
very familiar with contact

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:90%
scenarios.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So that is basically
when the Greys

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
get contracted and do
things for other species.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So basically, all these people
that report these scenarios

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and having seen a Grey,
that might not necessarily

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
mean that you are an
offspring from the Greys.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
It means that a Grey was
there to conduct something.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that you're
related to them necessarily.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> You did mention
the Pleiadeans.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.935 align:middle line:90%
Who are the others?

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, those are
mostly humanoid species.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.380 align:middle line:90%
We know Andromeda.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And we know Pleiades
have these kind

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:90%
of contracts with the Greys.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
There might be a lot of other
more covert contracts going on

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know of.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the contactees
mention this praying mantis ET

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.648 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:35.815 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about this?

00:05:35.815 --> 00:05:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, the Greys
themselves have other allies

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
which step in in
certain scenarios.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there is a
specific mantis-type species

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that is working with the Greys
on these contact scenarios.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And they are kind of their
scientific assistants.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
They are very highly
skilled in genetics as well.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And they especially have some
kinetic skills are pretty high,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
which means they can perform
certain surgeries way better

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
than the Greys
with their fingers

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and performing a lot of
other scientific operations

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So those species, they work
together very, very well, yes.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
You said the mantis works
well with the Greys.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, who is that serving?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Is it the Greys?

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.555 align:middle line:90%
Is it the mantis beings?

00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's a
well-established partnership

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:90%
between those two species.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the Greys
have undertaken the effort

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to bring together certain
species for a common goal,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
which is establishing a certain
order across the universe

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.305 align:middle line:84%
so that life in the universe
can flourish in its own terms.

00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than the mantis beings,
are the Greys also working with

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.182 align:middle line:84%
other beings that
you can talk about?

00:07:06.182 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> So yes.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Their approach is to collect
as many species as possible

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and bring them together
under one roof, so to speak.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And they see
themselves as guardians

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of procedure
and roof, this kind of house

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
that they build where they
put all these species.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are not
only the gray Greys.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But they have
different colors and

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
different
fiber-printed personnel

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that they use on
different planets as well.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So who's benefiting
from these contacts?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Is it the extraterrestrials?

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Is it the humans?

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a very
subjective question.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So some cases, especially
with certain reptilian races,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
their contact scenarios
are usually a little darker

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:90%
in the way they turn out.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So people sometimes make
those bad experiences

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:90%
with contact scenarios.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Similar to what happens on Earth
when human team of scientists

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
go and put an implant into a
dolphin or any other species,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
so the question might
be who is benefiting

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:90%
from these kind of operations.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it
brings some security

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to the life of the dolphin.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you could argue any
other way around the scenario

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and say it might be invasive,
disturbing the natural life,

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:90%
some--

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.922 align:middle line:84%
>> What type of information are
they trying to gain from these

00:08:38.922 --> 00:08:40.714 align:middle line:84%
implants that they put
into the contactees?

00:08:40.714 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so basically, what
people might not know is that

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
basically, everyone who gets
contacted has an implant.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the procedures that

00:08:54.770 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:84%
is potentially 100% certain
that they're going to do that.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of these implants
are more obvious.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Others are very hard to detect.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
They usually put them
very close to the nerves.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So the reason for that is
that they collect certain body

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:84%
information through
those implants.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they made out
of what material?

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, the
implants that they are using,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
at least the Greys, they are
organically printed implants

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that blend in with the
human system pretty well.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So they either put it in
one of the arms, the legs,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
or the back of the head,
where the spine and the skull

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:90%
connect.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And those implants, they
dock into the natural energy

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:90%
source of the body.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have a
battery or something.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But they get energy
from the body itself.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a pattern to
the selection of contactees?

00:10:01.385 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is a pattern.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So one might think
that they only

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
put-- contact people that might
be socially, very well situated

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:90%
But that is not the case.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So money or position
or whatever,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't play
any role to them.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:84%
What they are looking for is
either hybrid material that

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:90%
is coming from other species.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Or it is persons that are on
a specific spiritual path,

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
for example, and open
up for the possibility

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to connect to a certain species
and so have this kind of soul

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:90%
contract, if this makes sense.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys, as a
time-traveling species,

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:90%
they basically wait for your OK.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:10%
And if you give it in one
of those timelines, then

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:10%
they reach out to
you even when your OK

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:10%
comes after they have contacted
you, which is often the case.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there something with
family lineages that might have

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:84%
something to do with the
contactee or heritage?

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so what we know is that
most of the people that get

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:84%
contacted and have some
kind of relationship to some

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
nonterrestrial species,
that this is going

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
on in their family
for quite some time.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
families that

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:84%
might have reptile
genes in their heritage.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And they keep their
eyes on that, yes.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that various
ET species who influenced human

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
DNA may be the reason why
different cultures, religions,

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and countries on
Earth are in conflict?

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that the
enormous amount of diversity

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have on the surface
level of planet Earth,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that this is kind of creating
a lot of turbulences.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
the influences that

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
come from outside of the
planet, that those influences

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:84%
brought a lot of
challenges with them.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
What we also see-- and this is
a very controversial topic--

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:84%
is that throughout time, we
had certain power structures

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, for example, heading
down power to the next child.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
suggest that when

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you have a species
that can reintegrate

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
into their own children, that
it would make total sense to set

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
up a system where
power is handed down

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:90%
through the lineage.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are the
implications of that, Tim?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's basically--

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:84%
we've seen that certain
species use this planet

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:90%
for their own advantages.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So basically, setting
up a power structure

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
so they themselves
can benefit from it.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically something
that we find throughout history

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And these beings
especially take advantage

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.975 align:middle line:84%
of basically humans not knowing
what's going on in the world.

00:13:24.975 --> 00:13:26.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, what is the benefit?

00:13:26.565 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, the human
species as an ape species,

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
they look up to a certain
alpha monkey, so to speak,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to give
commands down to them.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And if another
species from outside

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
knows how that works and
how those social dynamics

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
among those human
species work, they

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
can use their intellect
and their knowledge

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
about how the universe is
structured and what's going on,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
maybe even use the
psionic features just

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
to set up a system that they
can benefit from for generations

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:90%
and generations to come.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> How does a typical
contact scenario take place?

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We have different phases
of contact scenarios through

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:84%
a time, which has to do a lot
with the progress that humanity

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:84%
has done preventing
certain interactions.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So basically, in the first
part of the last century,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
we found that contact
scenarios were

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:84%
much more physically and
much more direct in that way.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anyone
preventing those scenarios.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And over time, we have seen that
those contact scenarios more

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and more were conducted
in different ways

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and different realms of reality.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We've seen a lot of
scenarios going from sleep

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
into a certain dreamlike
state where consciousnesses

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:90%
gets information downloaded.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
something that we've seen.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking how those
contact scenarios take place,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
mostly, they use a
certain frequency beam

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
on the whole house so
everyone in the house

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:84%
gets into a certain
state of consciousness

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
where they are not alert
but basically very calm.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it's either a physical
presence, a physical contact

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
where beings come to
the bed, for example,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and collect someone.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Or it's more like
a dreamlike state

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
where people have these
weird communication, dreams.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And they remember them slightly.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:90%
So you definitely have those.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But the whole house basically
gets calmed in that way

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:90%
through this energy beam.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What if they're in a
building with multiple people,

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:90%
not just a single home?

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Does everyone get
affected or just

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
the people they are trying
to make contact with?

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone gets
affected from that.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they use a more
powerful beam of this vibrancy

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
in order to calm
down the whole house.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So basically, everyone
who's sharing the same spot,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.620 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, gets affected
through that energy

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and gets calmed in that way.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that multiple
people can have a contact

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.505 align:middle line:84%
experience that they all
share in the same home?

00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's an
interesting question.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I've actually not heard
about those cases.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's much more common that
we have individual cases where

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
certain people are specifically
selected and chosen.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, if there
are other people sleeping

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
in the same room, they could
get affected from that scenario.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, we see
that their memories get wiped

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.015 align:middle line:84%
so that they do not
remember what happened.

00:17:12.015 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When people are physically
taken out of the room,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
how do they go through
the wall or the ceiling?

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the question is, do
they get physically taken?

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen much more
often in the last few years

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
is a semi-physical
state of consciousness,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:84%
more like a out-of-body
experience or something

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
where the energetical
body gets separated

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:90%
from the physical body.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And they get brought
to a ship or something,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
to facility, to any
kind of location

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:90%
where they can operate on them.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, there are
physical contact scenarios

00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
as well, especially in the
first stages of contact

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:90%
when people get their implants.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
This is basically when
they need to make sure

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that the physical component
the body gets lifted and gets

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:90%
operated on.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So how does the 3D body
go through the structure

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:90%
of the home?

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we've seen quite
a lot is that these species can

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
open up certain jumpgates where
they can take a body and bring

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:84%
it basically everywhere,
wherever they want.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So you said they go
to a craft possibly?

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.465 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible
maybe another planet?

00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Possibly it could
be another planet.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But what we see is that
it's most of the time

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:90%
it's a craft or something.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It can be when some
species are involved

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that own underground facilities
on this planet that people get

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
brought to these facilities.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:84%
That is often when people
describe other humans

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:90%
in the background, for example.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And they say they are brought
into this military installation

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You mentioned the jumpgate.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
We've heard many times where
people are transported out

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
of a house or a room even
with livestock, for instance.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain this jumpgate?

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so basically, all
points in the universe are

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:90%
connected to eachother.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is open up
a folded amount of spacetime

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and connect one point
with the other point.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they
can bring a body

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
through this kind of portal.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And it will instantly
appear on the other side,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
which is a craft or an
underground facility

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.326 align:middle line:84%
>> So is this similar
to teletransportation?

00:19:52.326 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is another
technique that can be utilized,

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
which is basically dissolving
all the material components

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
of the body and setting
them back together inside

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:90%
of the craft.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
We have very few cases
where this happens

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and where we've seen this.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It's rare.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more often
seen that these species,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:84%
when they do
physical abductions,

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it that way, then

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.935 align:middle line:90%
they use jumpgate technology.

00:20:25.935 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> How far back in someone's
life can they be contacted?

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Can they go as far
back as the womb?

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>> They can.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:90%
They can.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
situation when people

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:90%
get contacted in the womb.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the way we
understand it is

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that when the
fetus gets created,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
there might be different souls
that try to enter this body.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand, there
is a natural mechanism

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
where one soul or two souls are
fighting over the same fetus

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
body to reincarnate,
so to speak.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
But we also seen that when
species want a hybrid baby,

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that they forcefully push
out one or another soul out

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:84%
of the fetus and put in their
own energetical soul offspring,

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Are hybrids more
likely to be contacted?

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, 100%.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So basically, every hybrid that
gets placed on this planet,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
they make sure that
they contact them.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:90%
So they know where they are.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:84%
They can control their vital
functions, see their heartbeat.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
They have certain
illnesses or something.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So they can basically
monitor that.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of investment,
so to speak, for them.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And they make sure that
those hybrids do not

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:90%
get lost along the way.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So what comes first?

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it the hybrid body
while it's gestating?

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Or is it actually the
soul that comes in?

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if we're thinking
about this early in the stages--

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and not all hybrids are
being placed into the womb.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But some are made along the
way by altering and modifying

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
the already existing genetic
profile that there is.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the
fetus is created first.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the specific
race does a lot

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of modifications and
energetical alterations

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
so that the fetus itself can
hold the extraterrestrial soul,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So this happens inside of
the womb and the mother

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:84%
already holding the
baby inside of her body.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And then when those
preparations are finished,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.065 align:middle line:84%
soul rejection process and
reintegration process starts.

00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When there's a
hybrid at a young age,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
are they going through a special
school system because of this?

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>> They do, actually.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So basically, every species
that put their hybrids

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.180 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, they
see them as investments.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:90%
So they take care of them.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:90%
They do it in different ways.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But the most organized
way that we've seen

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:84%
is the Grey school for hybrid
children, which is basically

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
a complete school system that
these hybrid children visit

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:90%
each and every night.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:84%
They get collected with
their consciousness.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:84%
They are being brought
to these crafts.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:84%
They learn the Grey language,
which children do remember.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
But they forget after some time.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
They learn the operatives
and the missions

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys are
doing, their philosophy.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:84%
They also learn something
about the human system as well.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
they get taught on.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they are
prepared for their mission

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, which is a
connecting approach

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:84%
between the human species
and the Grey species.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Are human governments
or agencies aware of this?

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.540 align:middle line:90%
And do they support this?

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> They are aware of this.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so many cases
that's screaming so loudly that

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.835 align:middle line:84%
people cannot overlook
this, actually.

00:24:53.835 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
So they are aware of it.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:84%
They even have their own
contracts, for example,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
with the Greys in order
to prepare certain humans

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:90%
for certain missions.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:90%
So this basically happens.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But then, again, there
is quite an effort

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.310 align:middle line:84%
in order to prevent
certain contacts.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment,
it's actually

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.780 align:middle line:84%
forbidden to do these
kind of contacts

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:84%
without the proper
permissions and paperwork.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean that it's not

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
going on on different
other realms of existence

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:90%
and reality.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's not this
kind of open contact scenario

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that we might have had like
50 years ago or something.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:90%
It's more subtle.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And species are aware
that they are not

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:90%
allowed to do this anymore.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But they still do it in
different other ways.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.185 align:middle line:90%
So they cannot get controlled.

00:25:55.185 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, many people are
making efforts to make their own

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.155 align:middle line:90%
personal contact.

00:26:00.155 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this
is a good idea?

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I do, 100%.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:11.055 align:middle line:84%
So I myself have done
certain contacts outside

00:26:11.055 --> 00:26:12.810 align:middle line:90%
in the German forests.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And we had some tremendous
success with that.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way to get in
contact with these interstellar

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:90%
families that there are.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And I can only motivate
each and every one

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to go out there and get into
meditative state of mind,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:84%
do it with a group, do it with
people that you trust, that you

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.870 align:middle line:84%
are connected with because
this is so much more powerful,

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and then try these
human-initiated contacts.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Because basically,
there are a lot

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
of races, species out
there that are still

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
waiting for indicators that
humans want an open contact

00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:90%
scenario.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And the more people we
have that say, yes, I do

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.240 align:middle line:84%
want to be connected with
certain other species,

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:84%
the more those species know, OK,
there's someone asking for us.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:90%
And they might appear, yes.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think that's
a really great idea.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe
the ETs might have

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.460 align:middle line:84%
an agenda of the
hybridization program

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:90%
to control the population?

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are some
species that like the idea

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:90%
of being in control.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But I would say the
vast majority of hybrids

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:84%
is in order to make
peaceful contact possible.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Are governments and agencies
around the world trying

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:90%
to block this?

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Or are they promoting it?

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>> They are definitely
trying to block it, yes.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, it creates a lot

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:90%
of psychological turbulences.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It brings things out
of hand in that way.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:90%
So this is sensitive.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a sensitive
thing going on.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So yes, they would rather like
to see it not happening instead

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:90%
of promoting it as something.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there's many
DNA programs out there.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that
these programs are actually

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.792 align:middle line:90%
to track hybridization.

00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:17.625 align:middle line:90%
What do you believe?

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I do
believe that as well.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So there are basically
two techniques--

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:84%
basically, two techniques in
order to find out if someone

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:90%
is a hybrid.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is by frequency or
by the genetic fingerprint

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:90%
that people carry around.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that at
least some groups will have

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:90%
an interest in those DNA kits.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people think there are
diseases and contagions out

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
there that affect hybrids and
force them into going to get

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
medical help and
also isolating them.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.776 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I try to be
very careful here.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what we know
is that some nonbenevolent

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:09.570 align:middle line:84%
species have done their
best in order to bring

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:84%
some genetics into the human
body and the human species

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
in general in order to lower
their potential of evolution

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and development, which
basically makes the body more

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
accessible for
illnesses, makes humans

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:35.490 align:middle line:84%
die earlier than they should,
making it 70 years or something

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:84%
instead of 300, which
could be possible,

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
but also lowering
their potential

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:90%
of cognitive development.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that
people are quite aware of.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
There might be genetic
solutions to that

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:84%
in order to destroy the
negative programs that

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.825 align:middle line:90%
are inside of human DNA.

00:29:57.825 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Very fascinating, Tim.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.572 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:30:01.572 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Emery,
for having me.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
