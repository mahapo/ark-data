>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we're with David Adair,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:10%
space technology
transfer consultant,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:10%
US Navy jet engine technician,
field research for the Office

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
of Naval Intelligence,
and so much more.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.343 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, David, there are people
out there that are suggesting

00:00:36.343 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:90%
that the moon is not real.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:90%
What is the science behind this?

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it a planet?

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it a spacecraft?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It's so unknown to
the people right now.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Even the scientists now are
questioning themselves at NASA

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and at the major universities.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's-- oh, man.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know where
to start on them, right?

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Our moon is so different from--

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.242 align:middle line:84%
there's no other moon in
the solar system like it.

00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
From what we've seen with
the Hubble Telescope,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
we never see a moon and a
planet situation like we have.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the moon
is, it's a strange thing.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
As far as planetary things
go, it's an odd child.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.547 align:middle line:90%
It showed up here.

00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And then our Earth--

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
mean, it showed up?

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:90%
How did it show up?

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The cosmotologists and
the Native American Indians.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.142 align:middle line:84%
>> They both got
something in common,

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:90%
and that is the moon story.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
The Indians have songs about
the moon when it showed up.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Cosmotologists will tell you--

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they try to skip over
that part and downplay it.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But you know something
when they say,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
well, you do know the moon,
when it first got here,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:90%
it's only 22,300 miles away.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, wait a minute.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Which one of these
do we tackle first?

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:90%
When it first got here?

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:90%
And they said, that's different.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah,
with the lunar rocks that

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
came back from Apollo,
they're not really

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%
lining up with the Earth.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.585 align:middle line:84%
There's a 500 million
year discrepancy in age.

00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're telling me it
wasn't a chunk of Earth, then?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So I went, well, the old
collision theory is not right

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.283 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:02:19.283 --> 00:02:20.385 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, right.

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:23.625 align:middle line:84%
And he said it's caught
in a tidal lock where

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't rotate.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And as big as it is,
has no magnetic fields.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No poles, right?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> No molten core.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
no atmospheres,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
no Van Allen radiation
belts like with us.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, yeah, that's--

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and when it first got
here, from day one,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
it's been moving about an inch
and a third back each orbit.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And now it's 238,000 miles away.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.258 align:middle line:84%
>> But wouldn't it,
if it was a real moon,

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't the momentum of that--

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I could show
you on the blackboard.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The sheer mass forces
that are involved,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to stop a
body mass of that magnitude

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
22,300 miles out from
a planetary body that's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:90%
10 times its mass.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.370 align:middle line:84%
You've got a thing
called momentum.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be answered, and
it's just, like, stopped.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And the point it stopped was
interesting, 22,300 miles.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.138 align:middle line:84%
That's geostationary where
we put all our satellites.

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:30.430 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, what happened?

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
They all stopped right
there, jumped off

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of this like a bunch of fleas,
jumped over on planet Earth

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and started things
and kept moving away?

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now isn't the universe
expanding, though?

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:90%
It should be going out, but--

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What country put those
geological survey pyramids

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:90%
on there?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That was us.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
In the Apollo days, we
had six landing sites.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And we sent out various
instrument packages

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
on each of those sites.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them had the
exact same packages.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Some of them did.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But we put out four different
pyramids of mirrors.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And what they're designed
for, when a laser strikes it,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.970 align:middle line:84%
it'll return the laser beam
back to its point of origin.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have these laser
pyramids up there.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And astronomers fire their
lasers at it and it comes back.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.118 align:middle line:84%
And they measure the
distance that it's moving.

00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a daily thing?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a daily thing.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.178 align:middle line:90%
Every day they take readings.

00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.302 align:middle line:84%
>> People will go, well,
you've never been to the moon.

00:04:32.302 --> 00:04:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, how did this pyramid
of mirrors get there, dude?

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that,
this is really cool,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
we dropped four seismographs
of the six sites.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And we put them out
in a big square.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Was there a hum?

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Was there an echo?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> My question was, who
even started thinking this?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Who decided that on
the first landing,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Neil Armstrong would
set out a seismograph?

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:90%
What made you do that?

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Not a word.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because you
guys know something.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, look at the
craters on the moon.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Tycho goes across
its entire face.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the size of the
continent of North America.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:90%
A blast that big.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.530 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it's so shallow.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It hardly even dented it.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And somebody asked
me about that.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.285 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, pretty good
body armor on the car, I guess.

00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Or vehicle, whatever.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So where do you
think that density is?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it basically,
what, rang like a bell?

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Well when they fired the
upper half of the lunar module

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.645 align:middle line:84%
back to the moon, when
the astronauts crawled out

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and went in the command
module to go home,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:90%
they fired that thing down.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And it crashed a few miles
away from the seismograph,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and the moon
resonated like a bell.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So they got-- on
other flights they

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:90%
put more seismographs down.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they added
booster rockets

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
so they could drive it in
much faster, bigger, kaboom,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.320 align:middle line:90%
and more of a shockwave.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.033 align:middle line:84%
And on the last one, the
moon rang for three days.

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the significance
that it's ringing?

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me paint this
picture for you.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
The moon is not little, y'all.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
You can put the North American
continent on the face of it.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.946 align:middle line:84%
Times two, you've
got a backside.

00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a big area.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got all the moon
in between those two faces.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a sphere.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
So there's a huge area.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, inside the moon.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We know that the moon is
about 3,600 miles in diameter.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty big.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Or just across the
face, it's 3,600 miles.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So inside, we believe
that the moon thickness

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.050 align:middle line:90%
is over 500 miles.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Start doing the math.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:84%
That means there's a 2,000 mile
diameter void inside the moon.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what's resonating.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's in that void?

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
The people who drove it here.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.217 align:middle line:90%
Their homes.

00:07:20.217 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> They probably weren't too
happy with all that ringing

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:90%
going on for three days.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm sure they--

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:84%
well, that brings
me to my theory.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Why did we leave them
and never went back?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Doing research, do you know
how much pounds of junk

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:90%
we left on the moon?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> 400,000 pounds of junk.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, discarded moon
buggies, and lunar landers,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.308 align:middle line:90%
and 96 bags of feces that--

00:07:48.308 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, David, if you came to
my house and rang the doorbell

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:84%
for three days straight,
and dumped all your crap

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:90%
on my front yard--

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> On your roof.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>> --I'd be a little
perturbed about that.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You come in and dump
400,000 pounds of trash

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
on somebody's roof, and then
they hear you up there with

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
a flag saying, I'm
going to move here,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
you're going to say something.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So Neil said, they
said there was

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
people in the rim of the
crater watching them.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Could be the very
people I'm referring to.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:84%
They drove over and said,
like our moon, do you?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's OK.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.052 align:middle line:84%
Gather up some rocks,
take you some dust,

00:08:26.052 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and then get off this
moon and don't ever

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:90%
come back here, bunch of pigs.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And we got ran
out for littering.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> These craters on the
moon are extremely large.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were
taught in grade school

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.047 align:middle line:84%
that the moon is completely
being bombarded by meteors.

00:08:42.047 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But we all know
there's something more

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
to that 3,000 mile crater.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, like Tycho.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It runs across the entire face
of the face that faces us.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's 3,000 miles.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
If something impact
with that kind of force,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:90%
look how deep the craters are.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.570 align:middle line:84%
One crater in Arizona,
that rock that came in

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.340 align:middle line:84%
wasn't bigger than
a Volkswagen Beetle.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It was 30 miles wide.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a mile wide and
over 1,000 feet deep.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
The crater's as big as
they are on the moon.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:90%
They're not very deep at all.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And it might be because
as you go into the moon,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
as Neil learned,
that the top of it's

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
covered like a fine
powder, like a charcoal.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But when we drilled the
holes to put the flag up,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that drill went through
about an inch of dust,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:90%
and it hit something like metal.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was all that
drill bit could

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:84%
do to drill a hole big enough
to stick the flag in it.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It reminds me of a
dish, a radio telescope.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've come across this and
studied it for quite some time.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:90%
What do you think.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Could it possibly be
some sort of antenna?

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.068 align:middle line:84%
Well, what an antenna
that would make.

00:10:04.068 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's something, though.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You look at face
of the moon, it's

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
covered in thousands, tens
of thousands, of craters.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
any meteor hit a moon

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:90%
since we've been alive?

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
They have some small ones,
and we get photos of them.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But wherever that thing was,
it went through a storm.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.186 align:middle line:84%
Or it was right next to a planet
when it exploded, because it--

00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:90%
look at the impact on it.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> And it survived.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And it survived.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's some serious
technology there protecting

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if this is an
artificial structure--

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's amazing.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> How was it placed
there to begin with?

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And like, what do you think
is inside this structure?

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> My question is what kind
of propulsion system they got?

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, the most perfect
ship to fly through space

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
with is a sphere.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Asteroid.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at all of the planets.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%
They're all round.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:90%
They're not square.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:90%
They're not a Borg cube, right?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:90%
They're a round ball.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:90%
And look at our moon.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:90%
It is so perfectly round.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It's unusual for
a moon that size

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
to be that perfectly round.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:84%
If you doubt that, look at
Phobos and Deimos, Mars' two

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
moons.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:90%
They look like Idaho potatoes.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And ours, perfectly round.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:84%
When a full eclipse
happens, look at the ring

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:90%
silhouetted by the sun.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:90%
That thing is perfectly sphere.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:84%
To be hit that hard
like Tycho crater?

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It would have been--

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> That thing should have
looked like mashed potatoes.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.695 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't.

00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's something going
on with the moon, y'all.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it during this eclipse
that it's a perfectly round

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:90%
sphere?

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> A sphere.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
The odds of that
happening is really low.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Most moons are deformed, but
ours is just perfectly sphere.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And I could do something here
like, it drives me crazy,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Ancient Aliens.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Could it be?

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Could it be possible?

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going have to do
that to get this out.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I think, on one
side of the moon,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.460 align:middle line:84%
you've got all these
craters, thousands of them.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
On the dark side, It's
not nearly as damaged.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Just a third of the craters.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think
where they were,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:90%
their solar system exploded.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:90%
A planet blew up next to them.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why the moon was
just covered on one side.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:90%
It was a blast.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
One big rock really
hit Tycho crater.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And they decided, time to leave.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:90%
So they left.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they get to
Earth, they get it parked,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and they notice that
we're a water planet.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
slosh back and forth.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So they get in a tidal lock,
which is what they want.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It won't rotate, so we
can't see the back side.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The back side is not
as damaged as the side

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.723 align:middle line:90%
that faced an exploding planet.

00:13:19.723 --> 00:13:22.015 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming and going
out the back of that thing,

00:13:22.015 --> 00:13:23.775 align:middle line:90%
and we have no idea.

00:13:23.775 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
It's big enough where if it's
staying in a straight line,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
it'd fly out far enough
where none of our radars

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
would ever detect
anything flying.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like you get a dark
place in your cell phone.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Well that's what it is.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You could fly straight out
from the back of the moon,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:84%
get out far enough
where we can't see you--

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't see it.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --And then turn on your
big engines and leave.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Using the shadow
of the moon, right?

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're behind the moon.

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that's going on.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not there with people who
say there's moon bases there,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and there's this big spaceship
that slid in for landing,

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and a building made
out of swastikas.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not into that.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:90%
But I will give you this.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I've seen pictures of the
arch in the big tower.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't got a
clue what that is.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty tall.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:90%
How tall is that-- the towers?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> The arch is, it's in miles.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like 10 times or 100 times
the size of the St. Louis Arch.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't look like it's
made out of anything indigenous

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:90%
to the moon.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So I can't tell you
what it is, but I

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:90%
can tell you what it's not.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
part of the moon.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Even that pylon is
like, 10s of miles.

00:14:42.088 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, that
tower they've got.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.912 align:middle line:90%
Some of it looks like a cannon.

00:14:46.912 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
those things are.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:90%
But they deserve a serious look.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be flying
42 million miles one way

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to Mars, half a
billion dollar-- no,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
half a trillion dollar budget
to get to Mars and back.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.795 align:middle line:84%
The moon is only
238,000 miles away.

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we've been to the moon.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
We've seen everything.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:90%
How stupid a statement.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you what
you've explored.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You take the six
lunar landing sites,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
add up the mileage of the lunar
rovers and what they went over,

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
square miles, and
put them together.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
you've covered?

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
An area the size of the
Mall of America in Minnesota

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:90%
with its parking lot.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.177 align:middle line:84%
Now put that on the
continent of North America,

00:15:33.177 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you've explored.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and don't forget
the other side.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
You haven't even looked at 1%
of the surface of the moon.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't know squat
what's on the other 99%.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.583 align:middle line:84%
And that's where these pat-- you
know, tower, the arch, and all

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%
that stuff.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.078 align:middle line:90%
>> They should've went there.

00:15:51.078 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing that NASA
does not want anybody to do is

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
to land where that arch
is, where that tower--

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
and guess where I'd go?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:90%
That's the first place I'd go.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:84%
We'd land there with drones
where we can actually

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.542 align:middle line:90%
crawl up on it and feel it.

00:16:07.542 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:90%
We need to know what that is.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It's too good just to run--

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.692 align:middle line:84%
blow all that money
to go to Mars?

00:16:13.692 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what's
laying on the moon.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And if that's not good, there's
an energy source laying there

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:90%
which China's hot after.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And if they get control
of it, man, we're

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
all going-- you think we've
been buying stuff at Walmart?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to believe
when they get Helium-3 back here

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and crank it up.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.143 align:middle line:90%
They'll own the planet.

00:16:31.143 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the energy source.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
What is Helium-3,
for the audience?

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, Helium-3, this is
a deformity isotope made

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:90%
by the heat of the sun.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:84%
At about 50 million
degrees centigrade,

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
that thing gets a third
orbit called Helium-3.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
It's slung through the
entire solar system

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
courtesy of the solar
wind, which moves almost

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, here comes
Helium-3 coming to Earth.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And it runs into our Van
Allen radiation belts.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Then there's seven
layers of atmosphere

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:84%
it's got to deal with,
gravity, and all that.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:84%
And Helium-3 doesn't really make
it to the surface of the Earth.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.535 align:middle line:90%
Just a tiny trace amount.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And what little trace
amounts there is have already

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
been confiscated,
sucked out by no other

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
than the Pentagon
nuclear defense system.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:90%
Now why would they want that?

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:90%
You'll see that in a minute.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So somebody said, well,
what's up on the moon?

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The University of Wisconsin
grabbed an armful load

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:90%
of moon rocks.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:84%
We brought back about 1,200
pounds of them, scattered them

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
all across the universities
and did various research.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, the
University of Wisconsin

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
said, let's look for
Helium-3 in the moon rocks.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:90%
So they heated the rocks up.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Out came this gas.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:84%
They cooled the gas
down into a liquid,

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and they got liquefied
Helium-3, which--

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Explain to the audience how
valuable that, ounce per ounce,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
is on an energetic--
like, for energy.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you would
make power rods out of it,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
feed it into
conventional reactors,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:84%
which is we're talking
about your Tokamak reactors,

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
your power rods,
your fusion, fission.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Not the one I've
been working with,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
with electromagnetic
fusion containment.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
That's an orange.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.390 align:middle line:84%
You're over here with
a couple of apples.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But you feed that Helium-3
into these apples, buddy,

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.620 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have a super apple.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Because what will
happen, that Helium-3

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:84%
will get into that
chamber and burn.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And it'll take the
efficiency level,

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:84%
which reactors at best,
the very best, you've

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:90%
got total efficient, like, 61%.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:84%
This thing will drive
it into the high 90s.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
shut the reactor off,

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
walk in with shirt sleeves
and a Geiger counter,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:90%
and the Geiger says nothing.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.098 align:middle line:90%
>> No radiation.

00:19:08.098 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's how safe it is.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Clean, thermal
fusion and power.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
That little glass test
tube of liquid Helium-3?

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
That's enough to run every
nuclear reactor on this planet

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
for about 10 years.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All clean energy.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> All clean energy.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be looking at a street
value of about $2 trillion.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I have heard through
the grapevine that China is

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
the moon right now.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in my own opinion,
they are harvesting Helium-3.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me tell you something
about this whole story.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm up to my eyeballs in this
thing, more than I want to be.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me tell
you how smart China is.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
When we were working with
upper stage cryogenic staging

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:08.435 align:middle line:84%
rockets, it took us 45
years to get it figured out.

00:20:08.435 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:90%
The Soviet Union never did.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:90%
They don't stage if they go up.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:90%
One big booster.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.630 align:middle line:84%
China, in nine months,
figured it out by themselves.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Took us 45 years.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Nine months.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:90%
That's how smart they are.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, with that in
mind, you've got

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
somebody that smart, where are
they in their space program?

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Past tense.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:90%
They've already left.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:84%
They've landed on
the-- soft landed

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:90%
on the back side of the moon.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, well, what are
they doing back here?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:90%
This is where I get embarrassed.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I went to China one year,
talked to a bunch of people.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
interested in Helium-3.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
In America, nobody
even heard of it.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
interested in,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
wonder why, I developed
a mining process.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So I drew it all out
on the blackboard.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And what it is, you've
got to-- you soft impact land

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:84%
a device on the moon about
the size of an earth mover.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:84%
You've seen that,
little kid playing,

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:84%
running around, scooping up
dirt, changing the landscape.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get one
of them on the moon.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:90%
It's running around.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up
all the loose soil.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much Helium-3
up there from the testing

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%
of the moon rocks--

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
the University of
Wisconsin, we know this--

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.270 align:middle line:84%
that earth mover,
in about an hour,

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
is going to suck up
all that it needs.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to throw
it into the hopper.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It's going to turn the solar
power panels to the sun.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Pure sunlight out
there, no atmosphere.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
This thing will transfer
that into electrical power

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:90%
to transduce.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get so
friggin' hot in there

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to believe it.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Gas is going to come
rolling out these rocks.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.155 align:middle line:84%
They're going to capture it,
pipe it over to the side,

00:22:10.155 --> 00:22:15.320 align:middle line:84%
the shadow side of
the Earth conveyor.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
On the sunlight side, it's
250 degrees above zero.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> To keep it cool.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:90%
I got you.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>> 250 degrees above
Fahrenheit in the sun.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.777 align:middle line:84%
On the shadow side, 200
below zero Fahrenheit.

00:22:27.777 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So you pump the gas
over there, and it

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:90%
turns into an instant liquid.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you shoot the
liquid into a container

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:90%
like a cylinder in a gun.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Fire that cylinder
up to a mother ship,

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:84%
load it in, do a slingshot
effect, come off the moon.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Three days later, you're home.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:84%
This canister comes in,
parachutes come out.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
It lands on the land
because it can take a bump,

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:90%
it's not humans on board.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:90%
So it bumps.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You pick it up, and you've got
2,000 pounds of pure Helium-3.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:90%
And you will rule the world.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
they're doing.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I built this design,
tried to give it to NASA,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:90%
nobody wanted it.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.182 align:middle line:84%
So now they're going
to get the Helium-3,

00:23:17.182 --> 00:23:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to bring it back.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think the
moon's main function is?

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so special, that area?

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It has a function for Earth.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:90%
High tides, low tides.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
If the moon should
just leave, the people

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
there are just tired of us,
want a different neighborhood

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:90%
and decide leave--

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.567 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll have a
big stagnant pond?

00:23:38.567 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, when they
fire that thing up and leave,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I would not want to have
property on the ocean coast,

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to be underwater.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
control the tides.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And quite an effect.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:90%
That will affect everything.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The river that you have
inside the Gulf stream,

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:90%
all that will be disrupted.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Polar caps, they'd be disrupted.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.925 align:middle line:84%
The moon would hurt us
badly if it would leave.

00:24:06.925 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Could be one of the things
they threatened us with.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Said, you know, if people come
back here, we'll just leave.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:90%
We ain't gonna blow you up.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Just leaving is going
to mess you up--

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:90%
bad.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Taking our heart.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, control
of the tide's gone.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Desalination of the
oceans would occur.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:90%
I can go down the list.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It's one catastrophe
after another.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe our people
know about that.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
They just want to avoid
the moon altogether.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What else is unique about
the moon that you could share?

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my god, you ever
wonder why the moon is so shiny?

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean on a full night, full
moon, you can read a newspaper.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of
mirrors up there.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more than that.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
What we learned from the
moon rocks, the moon dust?

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.868 align:middle line:90%
It's diamonds.

00:24:58.868 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Crystalline structure.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Crystalline structures
over the entire moon.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know what
that stuff would be like.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.520 align:middle line:90%
But there's more.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I know something
y'all don't know.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
This is directly
related the story.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.952 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go on a tangent
but it all makes sense.

00:25:16.952 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:90%
This is one of my life stories.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I was called over to
Rockwell International,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:90%
I get along really well with.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me all
their plans and stuff.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, I was over there
with Al Ogram at that time.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:90%
He was the head of PR.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And Al and I were
moving a film vault.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And this forklift
comes in with a Hyster.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It's about 10 times
the size of a forklift.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Picked this vault up and pulled.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I heard something fall down
in the back, and it's rolling.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Al, there's
something on the vault here.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:90%
It's rolling.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
It's coming my way.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Clearly hear metal on metal.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a rollin'.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And out rolled this 16
millimeter film can.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And I picked it up.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And it had about a million
dust bunnies on it.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It had fallen between
the vault and the wall.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Nobody knew it was there.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So I wiped it off, threw
it in my briefcase,

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and went back to getting
this vault moved.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.175 align:middle line:90%
Well, I went home.

00:26:19.175 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:90%
And then I went home, home.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.236 align:middle line:84%
I flew all the way
back to North Carolina.

00:26:22.236 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And I opened the
briefcase, and I

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:84%
forgot about that
part of the briefcase.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And that film canister
is laying there.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh no.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm going, dang, I
forgot to give that back.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:90%
I had a 16 millimeter projector.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I put the film in.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting here watching
it and went, oh, it's

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:84%
one of these school films made
for high schools to watch.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, I'm
about to turn this off.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
And then von Braun came on.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.795 align:middle line:90%
>> No way.

00:26:51.795 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Wernher von Braun.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let me introduce
you to a guy named Chris Kraft.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:03.480 align:middle line:84%
He is the head director of
Johnson Spacecraft Center.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And Chris is there,
and I went, oh my god.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:90%
The biocenter.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
We've only heard of it.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever seen it.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's so important
about the biocenter?

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the center where
they take the moon rocks.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And they started
doing stuff with them,

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:24.370 align:middle line:84%
which my question was, why are
you doing that with moon rocks?

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:90%
What they all led you that--

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
those are the real
questions you should ask.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But he said welcome to
the corn growing chamber.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh my god,
I've heard of this

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:90%
but I've never seen it.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And you walk in this giant,
glass walled-off area.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these guys
over there with their arms

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:90%
in these big rubber gloves.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And they've got little cups of
dirt, putting kernels of corn,

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
spraying them,
setting them down.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said they've
all been sprayed

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:90%
with a layer of moon dust.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:90%

this thing and I go,

this is the only copy in

>> You ever heard of this?

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I've watched it for years,
over and over again.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.310 align:middle line:90%
So I guess what?

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:47.862 align:middle line:84%
I call up the South Dakota
Corn Growers Association.

00:28:47.862 --> 00:28:49.445 align:middle line:84%
And I told them,
boys, you ain't going

00:28:49.445 --> 00:28:51.380 align:middle line:90%
to believe what I've got here.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:90%
I got a film.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:90%
And I told them about it.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:84%
They said, won't you come
to our annual meeting?

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And I do.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a gymnasium sized
amount of people in there.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
About 100 farmers with
tripods are recording it

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:90%
as it comes off.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.343 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got 100 copies of
film going God knows where.

00:29:12.343 --> 00:29:14.135 align:middle line:84%
And I thanked the Corn
Growers Association.

00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
They said, no,
man, we thank you.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
what I'm looking at.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you guys like
to have a shot at that?

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.430 align:middle line:90%
And he says, why would you?

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of famine.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Basic corn.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what it
would do on rice.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what it would
do on other things.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Who thought that up?

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.640 align:middle line:84%
What caused that to
happen to bring that in?

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:84%
That means they're doing all
kinds of biomedical research

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:84%
things with moon dust that we
know absolutely nothing about.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:90%
We've never seen it.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And I got hard evidence film.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If it works on plants, it
will definitely work on us.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody concluded you can do
a multi-level growing organism

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate it
with the moon dust.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We grow organs in the
projects very quickly.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:90%
We can grow beings.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And the secret behind it
was the different types

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:84%
of crystals that were ground
up and the different types

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.260 align:middle line:84%
of minerals that they
would mix together

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate the DNA in the
condrones to multiply faster

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and to be stronger.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it could
have an effect like.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It had to be similar to that.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely got to
be in the mitochondria

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
into the multiplication
of the cells.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.205 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, something's
happening in there.

00:30:35.205 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.965 align:middle line:84%
My question is, what
if a compound like that

00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:90%
is mixed with antibiotics?

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Or in an IV?

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Or open surgery?

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how fast the
tissue would heal.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.750 align:middle line:90%
No scars.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for being
on the show, David.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:90%
