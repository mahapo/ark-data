>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty, a
retired counterintelligence

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:10%
agent who served in
the Air Force Office

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately involved
with UFO/ET-related content.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.655 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: People speak of
extraterrestrials being

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:90%
integrated into our society.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about this?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I think it's true.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:90%
They have been.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have some
information about something

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.665 align:middle line:84%
that had occurred
some years ago,

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:90%
at Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:84%
The incident at
Kirtland Air Force base,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:90%
where they found the bodies?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.015 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, what can
you tell us about that?

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: An Air Force helicopter
flying over a remote area

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
at Kirtland Air Force
Base in an area called

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Coyote Canyon located five
bodies lying in a pile.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
A helicopter pilot, Air
Force helicopter pilot

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:84%
reported it to
the base security.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Base security law enforcement
and Sandia lab security

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
responded to the scene
and found five bodies--

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
all males, unclothed-- in a pile
in a remote area of the base.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:84%
The security police
immediately notified AFOSI,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:90%
which included me, and the FBI.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, responded to the scene.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And we examined these
bodies lying in this pile.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did
they look like?

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They were all male.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
They were unclothed,
and they were

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:84%
in the ages of between
50 and 80 years of age.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.598 align:middle line:90%
And they died of unknown reason.

00:01:44.598 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
blood in their bodies.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
blood on the ground.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We found a lot of
anomalies on the ground

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that we collected
and categorized,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
just like a crime
scene, so to speak.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But the bodies were
autopsied at the Armed Forces

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Institute of Pathology.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
We had no identities on a body,
couldn't identify anything.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
The fingerprints
taken from the body

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:90%
was not identifiable to anyone.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So the pathologists
in Washington

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
found the organs, certain organs
from each body was missing,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
such as a kidney, a prostate,
a liver, a spleen, a pancreas,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:90%
a heart.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But the organs were removed from
the body without any incisions,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and the pathologist
just couldn't understand

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:90%
how that could have happened.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
They rule on a lot of different
things, such as animals.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:90%
No animals could have done that.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
And what happened to the blood?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.227 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure out
what happened to the blood.

00:02:46.227 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:84%
There was no blood
on the ground.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
One small spot we found,
but other than that,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't any other
blood on the ground.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And their main question was, how
did anyone remove those organs

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:90%
without an incision?

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so an extensive
investigation

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:90%
turned after that.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We did find some strange
things on the ground, something

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:90%
like a gel substance.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We found the same gel substance
inside one of the bodies.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
We traced that gel
substance to a person

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
that had been in contact with
it, an ET, sometime earlier.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:84%
That female had this same
substance inside her uterus.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a scientific
mystery, a scientific mystery

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that encompassed medical
personnel, scientists,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and investigators like
myself trying to figure out,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:84%
number one, who these people
were, who these men were,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
where they come from,
and how they got there.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we could
come up with was it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:90%
had been done from the air.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The bodies had to have
been dropped from the air,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
because in that particular
section of Coyote Canyon,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:90%
it's secure.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: You can't get into it.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Somebody would have
had to have special permission

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:84%
to get into that area, because
there's high-level security

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:90%
gates all over that area.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So was it somebody
from the base?

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:90%
We did an investigation.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed the people
that had a contact.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the area
supervisor, the person

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that had responsibility
for that area,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.490 align:middle line:84%
there's intricate
control point logs.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that
entered that area had

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to sign in with their
license number, which

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
was-- the only vehicles
allowed in there

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
were the government vehicles.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We also thought
about maybe somebody,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
how they rigged the gate or
bypassed the lock on the gate

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to get in, because
between 12:00 midnight

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.848 align:middle line:84%
and 6:00 in the morning, there
wasn't any security out there.

00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Nothing-- we didn't find
anything wrong with the locks.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
We had specialists
look at the locks.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:84%
We analyzed the locks
and the alarm systems.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was malfunctioning.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Then we thought, well,
maybe some aircraft

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:90%
flew in this area.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You checked the radar?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: We checked radar.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
We checked the base,
the flight logs.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that we knew
of got into that area,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
but the anomaly existed when
we went to the civilian air

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:90%
traffic control center.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
At a particular time
early in the morning,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
there was a blimp that
appeared on the radar screen.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
The air traffic control
center didn't see anything.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
They immediately notified
the radar approach control

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.502 align:middle line:84%
in Albuquerque and said,
do you have anything

00:05:38.502 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:90%
flying at a certain altitude?

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Then the object disappeared.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So the air traffic
control system

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:84%
figured it was clutter
in the atmosphere

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or at that particular
night there was clouds,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:90%
so they just dismissed it.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Something came from a higher
altitude to a lower altitude,

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
dropped off those bodies, and
then flew to a higher altitude

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:90%
and got out of there.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way those
bodies could have got there.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.770 align:middle line:90%
So what does that lead us to?

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:90%
ETs.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Why and how did they do that?

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you worked
closely with Dr. Kit Green.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know he was part
of this investigation.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
What did he have
to say about that?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, he was
as puzzled as we were.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:10%
He examined the bodies.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:10%
He did his own very, very
extensive examination

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:10%
after the pathologists.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
He gathered some body
tissues and things

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that the pathologist
didn't gather.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And then he had it analyzed
at an independent laboratory

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
or, I should say, a
secretive laboratory.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
things that we found.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the material on
the bodies or in the organs

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
were not anything that
we could identify.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The molecules, the molecular
structure of this substance

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:84%
was not something
we'd ever seen before.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And we came to the
conclusion that it

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:90%
had been an ET incident.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Why they did what they
did, we don't know.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Why they took certain organs--

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
at that time, we
couldn't figure it out.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Later on, people smarter than
me, scientists and so forth,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
started figuring out that the
ETs were creating hybrids--

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
hybrid humans, part
ET and part humans.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And why they were doing
it, we don't know.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
But they were taking
certain organs,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
taking out certain enzymes
and tissue from those organs,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and then growing into a
humanoid or a hybrid body.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
And the way that ETs did it--

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know that we could
figure out how they did it--

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
was planning those
tissue samples

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and those other
things in the body

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
enabled organs, similar
to human organs, grow.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:90%
But they were hybrids.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.675 align:middle line:84%
How long were those
bodies out there?

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: If we base it on the
time that the craft, we think,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:90%
came--

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
was the blip on the
radar, so to speak,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and then the time they were
discovered is about five days.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So there was already--

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
what about any animals
were nibbling on them?

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:84%
Were the insects
already infested?

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:90%
Was there larva from the flies?

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Surprisingly, no.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
No animals, no animal
wounds, nothing

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle line:84%
had been penetrating the
skin of any of those humans.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
No larva, fly larva, had been
infested in the bodies, which

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
you would normally find in a
body that had been subjected

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to heat of the New Mexico sun
and the duration of their stay

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
there or the
deterioration of the body.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
These bodies did not show any
signs of post-mortem lividity,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:84%
anything to indicate
that they died

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
a normal deterioration
of the body that would

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:90%
occur after somebody dies.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.023 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find any of that.

00:09:31.023 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there any
interesting genetic findings

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:90%
on the bodies?

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.565 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They had some
anomalies in their body.

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Someone had a heart problem.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
The other person had
a kidney problem.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
One guy had an
enlarged prostate.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
One guy had lung
problems from smoking.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
There was something wrong
with these five bodies.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:90%
But where they came from--

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
as far as I know, as
of when I left OSI,

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:84%
we could never find or determine
where these bodies came from

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.737 align:middle line:90%
or their identities.

00:10:06.737 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how do
you think this ties

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
into the ETs that
are amongst us?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we came
to the conclusion

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that these five humans, men,
were abducted someplace.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And a number of different things
were performed on their bodies,

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:84%
more like a anatomy student
or a medical student.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.918 align:middle line:84%
Open up a body for
an anatomy lesson.

00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is
the purpose of this?

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
the ETs did this?

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were trying
to develop humanoids

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:90%
through a hybrid process.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They were so
advanced, technology

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and probably medically,
they knew our bodies.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:90%
They must have known our bodies.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.940 align:middle line:84%
They knew what
organs to take out.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to take them
out, which was a mystery to us.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:90%
And they knew what particular--

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
how to take those tissue samples
out or take those organs out

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and implant them into humans.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
We know that some of
the substance found

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
on these and inside
these bodies were later

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:84%
found in contactees, in
their vaginal tracts,

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:90%
in their uterus--

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:90%
the same exact substance.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So that is an indication
what they were trying to do

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
is make hybrids,
and I don't know

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:90%
that we ever found out why.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We know that they
were doing it, because we

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:90%
found other evidence.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There's lot of other
evidence of bodies,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
dead bodies with the same
substance at other locations

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't investigate
but were reported, the same--

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
a body found here in the
middle of a swamp in Louisiana,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
a body found in an
isolated location

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
near the Canadian
border and North Dakota

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that was unclothed--
the same exact thing,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:90%
with organs missing.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.535 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't just one incident.

00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a number
of incidents that

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
were occurring over a period
of time, over several years.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And we connected all
those, these incidents,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to a substance, which is like
a jelly form or something.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The gel, right.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: The gel.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a hydrophobic
type of gel, I've heard.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reports I read, it

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
was used for conductivity to
get the frequency of that body.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of like--

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
they used some sort of
harmonic device, like an X-ray.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But they just put a
couple parts of the body.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And it duplicates the
body into circuitry,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
into like a hard drive
that they can take.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's secondhand
information I'm telling you.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, something
similar to that.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Kit Green developed a really
good theory that was something

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:90%
like that, that at some point--

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't then, it was
some time later, maybe a year

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:90%
or so--

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
they did find out
that these bodies

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
had a certain rhythm,
sound rhythm or frequency

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:90%
that were all the same.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So somehow the ETs
could figure that out

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and knew enough about
us that we didn't know,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
develop that knowledge

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that each body had a frequency
until sometime later.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, some years later.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've developed
a way of testing it

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and find out that everybody
had a different frequency.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But the ETs knew it years
and years before we did.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So they must have
been experimenting

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:84%
with our bodies and
humans for many years,

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:90%
because they knew us.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:84%
They knew our anatomy,
our physiology.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And they knew what to take
to make other hominoids

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:90%
or hybrids.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did you
come to the conclusion

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that it was a hybrid and not
maybe something that was cloned

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:90%
or grown in a laboratory?

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, first
of all, we had

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
a lot of top
scientists, doctors,

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and pathologists and
others working on this.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was a totality
of the evidence that

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
had been gathered over the
years, the contactees who

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
had seen things, vats with
humans inside of them.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And these contactees
were thoroughly

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.920 align:middle line:84%
vetted to determine they
were telling the truth.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Evidence other
letter agencies found

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
showed that there was
an ET race experimenting

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.675 align:middle line:90%
within the human bodies.

00:14:46.675 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
These bodies that were found
all over the world, not just

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:84%
the United States,
but over the world.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It was a joint
effort, basically.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
It all pointed into
this, with this evidence,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:90%
into that direction.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And I always pointed to a
hybrid, a extraterrestrial DNA

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
mixed with human DNA to
create something as similar

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to a human as possible but
yet also extraterrestrial.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.622 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what's the
agenda on the ET side?

00:15:16.622 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Why would they do this?

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we can't get
inside of the head of the ET.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
real smart people

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:84%
figured out it had to have
been in order for them

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to mingle with us, walk
amongst us in society

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:90%
without us recognizing them.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And then some other reason,
maybe a future invasion

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.590 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of a
military type of operation

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
or just surveillance or just
keeping a watch over us.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have they
integrated influential areas

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:90%
of government?

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That's always the
scary portion of this,

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
whether they infiltrated
the government, not just

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon or the US Senate
or House of Representatives.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.892 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The
three-letter agencies.

00:16:02.892 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Other agencies.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Corporations.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Corporations or
even the White House.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.103 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, and
that's something

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:90%
that scares a lot of people.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:90%
It scared a lot of people.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, at some point,
I think it was after I had left.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But they tried to develop
some sort of a method

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:90%
to detect them.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And this method was a--

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
once the government-- of course,
the government, the military

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
had DNA testing way
before society did.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And they developed with several
different medical institutes

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology--

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Kit Green was involved in this.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
They developed a
unique way to test DNA.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
exactly they did that,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.530 align:middle line:90%
but they would test DNA.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:90%
And if they did the test right--

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and they had to do it,
I think, from fluids

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and from skin or
something to that effect,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:84%
they could determine
the alien DNA.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the government
then had a test--

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
they still have it now,

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:90%
or they probably refined it--

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
to determine it was a
counteraction to the ETs.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, you might be able
to make a hybrid.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.603 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
detect who they are.

00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you know of any
technology that's Earth-made,

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
man-made that can detect
besides the DNA testing to spot

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial amongst us?

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, that was tested by
a number of different agencies

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and by a number of different
institutes, highly classified.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the frequency.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The
frequency one, yeah.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, the frequency of--

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.190 align:middle line:84%
the ETs don't have a
frequency like we do.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And so if we have
devices that can

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
test the frequencies
of every human being

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and if there's no
frequency that comes back,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
we know there's suspicion
on that particular person.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Rick, how
does this frequency device

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
work to test if this
is an extraterrestrial

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:90%
or this is a human being?

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:90%
What's the science behind it?

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.065 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I'm not
sure about the science.

00:18:22.065 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:90%
But I know they have meters.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
They were developed in the
late '90s and into the 2000s,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and they detect
certain frequencies.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that
we test in these machines

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
are a range of frequencies
that humans have.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem
with that is an ET

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
could have a frequency
much, much higher

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
than a human frequency.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Not each human has
the same frequency.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be a range of
frequencies tested in order

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether
that's a human being.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And if the extraterrestrials
figure that out--

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're smarter
than we are--

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
they might have
countered it to develop

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:84%
at a frequency in their bodies
that are similar to us or way

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:90%
beyond the spectrum.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.712 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they're way
beyond the spectrum,

00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:84%
they're a dead
giveaway, because we

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
know that humans only operate
within a certain frequency,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:90%
every human body.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And if it's beyond that
frequency, then we would detect

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
or we would be
suspicious of that person

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:90%
being an extraterrestrial.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, what happens after that?

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I was never privy to whether
they ever arrested anybody

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
or whether they
detained anybody.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there's a place like
Guantanamo Bay, where they're

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
locking them up, or Area 51,
where they're locking them up,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:90%
because they're not human.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But I do
believe in what you say,

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
because we have
proof that they can

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
mimic the frequency of a human
being and walk amongst us.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
difficult for them.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I think we do now have
higher technologies,

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
like you said, that we had that
back in the '90s, early '90s.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what they
have today to really spot

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.035 align:middle line:90%
these beings out there?

00:20:04.035 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And if the
ETs figured it out,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
they could counteract
that and maybe create

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
a more perfect human, maybe
a totally cloned human being.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
much about that.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I've heard a little bit
about humans being cloned,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:84%
but I can't really
talk about that.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know much about that.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.928 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I've heard
and read involved hybrids.

00:20:34.928 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Besides
frequency, are there

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.053 align:middle line:84%
other signs that can
tell if someone's

00:20:38.053 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:90%
a hybrid or an extraterrestrial?

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, brainwaves,
measuring brainwaves.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials have
an extremely active brain,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:90%
more so than a human.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And so if you could center
them, if you could detect,

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
number one, frequency
and then you

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
could confine them to
check the brainwaves, that

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
would more or less
confirm the fact

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.247 align:middle line:84%
that this particular entity
was an ET and not a human.

00:21:09.247 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, you spoke about
the military infiltration,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
possibly, and the Vatican of
an extraterrestrial presence.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.862 align:middle line:90%
Can you explore that for us?

00:21:17.862 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, there was a
military officer some years

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.670 align:middle line:84%
ago that was suspected
of being different--

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.985 align:middle line:84%
maybe a spy, maybe
psychologically unstable.

00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What branch?

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Air Force.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Position?

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He was a
high-ranking colonel.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
He was a colonel, an
O-6 in the Air Force.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was being watched very,
very carefully and at the point

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:84%
where OSI got a FISA
warrant to bug him.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that he was
having these strange contacts

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:84%
through some kind
of communication

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:90%
system with something else.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And then when we confronted
him, when OSI confronted him,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
he admitted that he
was, in fact, a hybrid.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what was
the red flags for OSI

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
to get involved
with this person?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: His supervisors started
questioning what he was doing

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:90%
and why he was doing things.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And initially, they thought he
was psychologically unstable.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Maybe he had a
brain tumor or something.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.072 align:middle line:90%
And so they ruled all that out.

00:22:21.072 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They made him go get examined
in a brain scan and so forth,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and that all panned out.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:90%
He was normal.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
really, really watching him.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
They're just the supervisors,
not law enforcement.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing strange
things, going to strange places,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
driving his car to a certain
point, and walking up a hill

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and sitting on
that hill all night

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
which made him very

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:84%
suspicious of a colonel in
the United States Air Force

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:90%
doing these things.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So then they got law
enforcement involved.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:84%
That's when OSI came in and
did their investigative tactics

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.917 align:middle line:84%
and FISA warrants and so
forth and determined, he's

00:23:01.917 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:90%
talking to somebody.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
He's communicating with
something, possibly alien.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: He didn't admit
to what he was talking to?

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No, he wouldn't.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:84%
He said he just likes
to go for walks.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:90%
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't committed any crimes.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But when we started doing
the surveillance stuff

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and catching him
doing anything--

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and another odd thing
about it, he's never slept.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:90%
He just didn't sleep.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:90%
We bugged his house.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:90%
He never slept.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:90%
He never used his bed.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:84%
He'd sit in a strange
contortionist manner.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And so that made us think.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the report,
it actually said,

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
we don't believe this
person is, in fact, a human.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they confronted
him and got him in custody,

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:90%
they said, what are you?

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And he admitted to--

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.112 align:middle line:90%
he was, in fact, hybrid.

00:23:54.112 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And he'd been one for--

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What kind of hybrid?

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.057 align:middle line:84%
And how did he get to this
position, and who did it?

00:23:58.057 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He was born--

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was created that way.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't say.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
He just knew he was
communicating with the grays.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:90%
He knew the grays.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
He was part gray, although
he was also human, too.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was communicating,
providing them information.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And he was, in fact, giving
our secrets away to the--

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and in his position,
I think he was

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
something to do with aircraft
scheduling and so forth.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember exactly, but he
was giving all that information

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.830 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was to
extraterrestrial race,

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:90%
that's still espionage.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.828 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, was he charged?

00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We do investigative
turn over to command.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to them to
court-martial him or whatever.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever
happened after that,

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure somebody within
OSI, the higher level knew.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.313 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know.

00:24:53.313 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he have
any family members?

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, he
was never married.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
He spent 24 years in the
United States Air Force.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
He grew up in a small town
in, I believe, Maryland.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:90%
No, Maine.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me, Maine,
out of Bangor, Maine.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:84%
When we started trying to find
his background information,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.510 align:middle line:90%
we came up with a dead end.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't find out what school
he went to or the school

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:84%
he claimed he went to, didn't
have any record of him.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.098 align:middle line:90%
He did go to college.

00:25:21.098 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
what college it was,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:90%
but he had college transcripts.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
He entered the Air Force, and he
worked his way up to colonel--

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:90%
very smart, very intelligent.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But the ironic part
that I have to mention

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:84%
is he went to Squadron Officer
School when he was, I think,

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:84%
a lieutenant or second
lieutenant, first lieutenant.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.750 align:middle line:90%
And one of his--

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
his roommate in
Squadron Officer School

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:90%
commented on a evaluation.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
In Squadron Officer School, you
have to evaluate each other,

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:90%
After one week, you evaluate me.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.140 align:middle line:84%
He evaluated this guy,
and we found this later.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't believe
this guy is human.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.558 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen him sleep.

00:26:09.558 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
He said that in officer school.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And years later, and
that's 20-some years later,

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:90%
we find that out.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%
But nobody thought that was odd.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, he lived alone.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
The only time he had
a room with somebody

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.037 align:middle line:84%
was when he went to
some kind of school.

00:26:23.037 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And once you make
the rank of captain,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
room by yourself.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to
have a roommate, just

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:90%
in Squadron Officer School.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And this one other
first Lieutenant said, I

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:90%
don't think this guy is human.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I never saw him sleep.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Validation.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.342 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Validation right there,
but nobody paid any attention

00:26:39.342 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:90%
to those valuations.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Probably nobody ever read them.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
What about his
physical appearance?

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Was it anything noticeable
that was different than us?

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He was very slender.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I think the only thing
that I can remember

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.650 align:middle line:84%
is that he was
extremely slender.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
He had odd-shaped feet, and he
had to get almost special shoes

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:90%
to fit his feet.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is another anomaly
that nobody ever caught.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any
nails on his thumb.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have any thumbnails.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there's a medical
condition that some people are

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:90%
born without fingernails.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I understand that, but he just
didn't have them on his thumbs.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What color
were his eyes?

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I don't remember
what color his eyes were.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And then the nose
and ears looked normal?

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think they
were all normal.

00:27:28.545 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Normal.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.578 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Oh, he
didn't have any hair.

00:27:30.578 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any
facial hair, or he

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any hair in his
ear and his ears or nose,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:90%
like most humans grow hair.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the-- and
Kit Green actually coined

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
a reason for that, because
if you can manipulate

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.795 align:middle line:84%
a certain portion of your DNA,
you can make a bald person.

00:27:50.795 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
You can make a person
without any hair.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, so.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Quite the engineering
accomplishment there.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.965 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
other ways were you

00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:84%
able to determine who was
a hybrid and who was not?

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well,
ironically speaking,

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:90%
the Vatican developed a way.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I had a source who worked
in the Vatican for 15 years

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and had extensive
knowledge about hybrids.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Where they got that
from, I don't know.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:90%
They had thousands of books.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And they had a number
of papers on hybrids

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:90%
and how they were created.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
methods they found

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:84%
was exposing a hybrid
to intense light,

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really intense light.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.577 align:middle line:90%
And they can't stand it.

00:28:35.577 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:90%
They can't stand it.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes can't stand it,
and they can't stand it.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Their skin almost
starts peeling.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So under one
particular pope, anyone

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
that was going to
work in the Vatican

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:90%
would have to undergo this test.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And one particular
priest came from--

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember if it
was Argentina or Brazil,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:84%
but went to the Vatican to work
there for a period of time.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And they test them.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:90%
They actually tested them.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And when that priest was
exposed to light, he panicked.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And they determined that
he was, in fact, a hybrid.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And obviously, he--

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they did to him,

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't allowed
to work in the Vatican.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it
regular or white light,

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:84%
or was it some sort
of other color?

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Or was it UV light?

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: All I know
is an intense light.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what my source
who worked at Pentagon

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.790 align:middle line:90%
told me-- intense light.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ask him if it was
infrared or ultraviolet

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.825 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:29:38.825 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
the hybrids that

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
are integrated into
our society might

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.462 align:middle line:84%
be used to possibly facilitate
disclosure in the long term?

00:29:47.462 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, first
of all, we have

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to understand what kind
of government agencies

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
knows about it and that
are controlling it.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not privy to that.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
a possibility.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
likely possibility that--

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Slowly introduce
them to society over time.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exactly, slowly
introducing them.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to stop and
think of what repercussions

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that would cause
in society when--

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
me, the government, telling
you your neighbor's a hybrid,

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:84%
or the guy that lives
behind you is a hybrid,

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.990 align:middle line:84%
or the guy that you're
going to work with every day

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.790 align:middle line:90%
is a hybrid.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or you
voted for a hybrid.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Or you
voted for a hybrid.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a lot of thought

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that has to go into that before
the government would release

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But my personal opinion,
and you can take it

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:84%
the way you want to take
it, is there is probably

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
thousands and thousands of
hybrids out there walking

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.990 align:middle line:90%
amongst us.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And unless you do a complete
background investigation

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
on them or checked
their brainwaves or DNA

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
or expose them to intense
light, you probably will never--

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or install those
lights down at the airport,

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:90%
at the bus stations.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exactly, you
probably will never know it.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right,
you'll never know.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe in
that as well, Rick.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
thousands and thousands

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:84%
of these hybrids all
around the planet

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and full-blown
extraterrestrials that

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.260 align:middle line:84%
have intermingled with us
in many different fashions

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and are probably integrated
in many, like we said,

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:84%
corporations and
political governments.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, one of the things
that I want to mention finally,

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
one test that was
conducted-- and I

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:35.330 align:middle line:84%
don't know the medical reason
or the medical technique

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:90%
or the repercussions of this.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But I know Kit
Green knew about it.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:47.870 align:middle line:84%
If you take a extraterrestrial
sperm cell and--

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:90%
let me go back.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Not all extraterrestrials
that we know of have sperm.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
They produce other
ways, but there

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:90%
are some that do have sperm.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And you implant it in a human
ovary, it's not going to grow.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be some
manipulation of that sperm cell

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
or the ovaries of a human to
be receptive on that sperm

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
cell in order for that
particular contactee

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:90%
to have a hybrid baby.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, we know now that
the ETs have figured that out

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:84%
over the maybe
thousands of years

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
of trying to do this, figured
out a way to make it happen.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Might this be an effort
to merge civilizations together

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:90%
to help humanity?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I personally think yes.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that would be the best
way to integrate societies,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.660 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial-- us and
with extraterrestrials.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But then I always think of
the negative side of that--

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.190 align:middle line:90%
what if something goes wrong?

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are people
going to react to that?

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.287 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: How are people
going to react to that?

00:33:04.287 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But if I marry a person who
is a hybrid, I don't know it.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And we try to have children,
and something happens.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And maybe something is distorted
in the embryo or something,

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and those are the
things I think of.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's an idea
if we could come together

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:84%
as a universal society,
we know they're here.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we're
here with them.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.210 align:middle line:90%
We have to live amongst them.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll work
in most cases,

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:84%
but then there's probably
hostile extraterrestrials

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.300 align:middle line:90%
that it wouldn't work.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I love your
opinion on that.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
What about the other
agents out there

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and three-letter agencies?

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.600 align:middle line:84%
What do they
hypothesize about it?

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I speak with them.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with them in
the past, and they

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:84%
have the same
concerns I have, is it

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:90%
work well in a perfect society.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:84%
We're certainly not
a perfect society,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and there could be a lot
of problems developed

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:90%
if that was to happen.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard enough
that we can't get along

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:84%
with our own
neighbors, much less

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:84%
finding out another whole
hybrid civilization amongst us.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's true.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.159 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems that
intelligence agencies

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.170 align:middle line:90%
talk about--

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
the ones that had been
briefed into this program,

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.610 align:middle line:90%
especially within DIA--

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
is it might be all right
with one particular ET race

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
intermingling with us,
maybe creating hybrids.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.040 align:middle line:90%
But what about the others?

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.420 align:middle line:84%
What if there's four or five
or six or 10 or 20 or 50?

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.179 align:middle line:90%
Now what's going to happen?

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:90%
They're not coordinating this.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's no central
coordination committee

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.670 align:middle line:84%
someplace in the universe
that's coordinating this.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
hybrid Eben here.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got a hybrid
Trantaloid here.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You've got a hybrid
Quataloid here.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:90%
You've got a hybrid Gray here.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many different ones.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
What would this society
come through then?

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It would be not a
socialized society.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:90%
It would be a hideous society.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it seems to me
that is already happening here

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth with all
of our different races,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and we do have issues
with other races

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and other countries because of
belief systems and politics.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I can only assume
and hypothesize

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:84%
the same thing
would happen, again,

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
like what you just
said, introducing

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:90%
even more races into this.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And how do those races
feel about each other?

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, at least we're
intermingling with human

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to human, with our
races on Earth.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But now we're talking about
an extraterrestrial race.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And no two extraterrestrials
are like this,

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:90%
like no two humans are alike.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So these extraterrestrials
are coming here

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and trying to interbreed
with us or clone us

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:84%
or making hybrids
or doing things

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:90%
that we can't even imagine.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that scares a lot of people.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Kit Green is one of them.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And many others are
very concerned about,

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:13.290 align:middle line:84%
what are they doing that
we are not aware of?

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That is.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we've been
part of a hybridization program

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:84%
for the last thousand
years, and the chaos

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
we're going through right now
is that introduction to hybrids?

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Very possible.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.900 align:middle line:84%
EBE 1 tried to explain to us--
we probably didn't understand

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:84%
then, but we probably
understand now--

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:84%
that they have been visiting
Earth for thousands of years.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And what have they been doing
in these thousands of years

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
visiting Earth?

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:84%
You think they just started
this hybridization program now

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:90%
or in the '50s or '60s?

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:84%
No, they probably started
it thousands of years ago.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
We could be very well a product
of that hybridization program,

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and that could be why we
as a human race on Earth

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:90%
don't get along.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So if there's an upside
to this whole situation,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.000 align:middle line:90%
what would it be?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That we intermingle
with the extraterrestrials,

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and everything
works out perfectly,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:90%
and we live in a better society.
