>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who served

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Today, we discuss a UFO
nuclear weapon event.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is a
nuclear weapon event?

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Nuclear
weapon event could

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
be a covered wagon, a helping
hand, or some other code

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
word that the United
States government uses

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
for a threat against a
nuclear weapon, a threat,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:84%
an action posed against
a nuclear weapon,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.785 align:middle line:90%
or a theft of a nuclear weapon.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, I know you are
familiar with a special event.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it was at Loring
Air Force Base, correct?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Yes, Loring
Air Force Base

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:10%
in Northern Maine
near Limestone, Maine.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.435 align:middle line:10%
It was a strategic air
command base or a SAC base--

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: SAC base, yeah.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: --that
contained B-52 bombers.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And these B-52 bombers
had nuclear weapons

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:90%
installed on them.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And those B-52s were on alert
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And those nuclear
weapons were stored

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
in what the Air Force calls a
Weapons Storage Area, or a WSA.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, anybody
else would call it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear weapon storage area.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But nobody on base would refer
to it as a nuclear weapon

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:90%
storage area.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
They referred to it as
a weapon storage area

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
because anything else
would have been classified.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way the
terminology existed back

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And nuclear weapons were
a priority A resource,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
meaning they were guarded by
Air Force security personnel

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:84%
or security police,
they called them.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And before that, they
called them air police.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And they guarded
them with weapons.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And every sign around a
nuclear weapon storage area

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
states deadly force
is authorized.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
That means if you're
dumb enough to try

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to enter that nuclear
weapon storage area

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
or that WSA or the alert
area that contained the B-52

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
bombers with nuclear
weapons installed on them,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.285 align:middle line:90%
you could be shot.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what kind of nuclear
weapon event happened at Loring?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In November
1971, an event

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
happened that threatened
a nuclear weapon.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
In the late hours of the
evening during a snowstorm,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear weapons guard--

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
they call him Air
Force security police--

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:90%
he was a sentry dog handler.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But during the weather event,
because there was so much

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
snow on the ground, he
couldn't take his dog out.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force allowed him to go
out and perform distant support

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:90%
duties but not the dog.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So he was out there on a post
outside a nuclear weapon storage

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:90%
area guarding a fence line.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And the fence posts or the
postings of these security

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
policemen outside the fence
are in a 200-yard area.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So within a 200-yard area, they
have one, next distance away,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:84%
200 yards, they have another
Air Force security policeman.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So they're guarding
a fence line.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
About 23:30 or about
11:30 PM at night,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
this security policeman saw a
light coming towards his post.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
He watched that light
get closer and closer.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
He first thought, well, it's
an aircraft coming into Loring

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and going to land at the
base or the flight line area.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Then as it got real
close, he realized

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't a
conventional plane.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
He never seen
anything like that.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.603 align:middle line:84%
And he would watch B-52s and
jet fighters land all the time.

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All day long.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But as it
got real close,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
he realized it was
probably a helicopter.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So he radioed in on his radio,
which was called an Ht220,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and asked central
security control,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:84%
which was the control
center for all the security

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:84%
police within the alert area and
within the weapons storage area.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
The controller at the
radio said, negative,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:90%
we have no helicopter due in.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:10%
So all of a sudden, this thing
lands and lands some distance

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:10%
from him.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And because of this light
that was quite bright,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
he didn't know what
this thing was.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was about 80 to
100 yards away from him

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:90%
in a northeastern direction.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So he immediately
became alert, decided

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
this can't be something
that was scheduled.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:90%
So he stood his post.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately, he saw
something moving towards him.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
he didn't recognize.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
It didn't appear to be any
military person in uniform.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It didn't appear to
be another guard.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It didn't appear to
be his supervisor.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But it was something
wearing a helmet.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:10%
It was something that was tall.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle line:10%
And it had a silvery suit on.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized
it wasn't a human.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't know what it was.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So his orders, his
guard orders, is

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
to challenge anyone that
comes upon his post.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So he immediately chambered
around in his M16 rifle

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.635 align:middle line:84%
as he saw this
thing coming at him.

00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:43.135 align:middle line:84%
And he referred to
it as a humanoid.

00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:43.935 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Humanoid.

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He challenged him,
pointing his M16 at him.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:90%
And this humanoid was tall.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
He would say probably over
6' 5", 6 feet, 5 inches.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
This security policeman
was 6 foot himself.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And this being
that's coming at him

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.660 align:middle line:90%
was a lot taller than he was.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So the policeman tried to
transpond on his radio.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.645 align:middle line:90%
But his radio didn't work.

00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:09.445 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, great

00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so now
he's in trouble.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:90%
What does he do?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:84%
He's a young 19-year-old
security policeman,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
been at Loring Air Force
Base for about nine months,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:84%
right out of security police
school at Lackland Air Force

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the next thing
he's taught to do--

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
deadly force is authorized--
is start shooting.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
He shoots one round of his
rifle at this humanoid.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:90%
It stopped.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:90%
The humanoid stopped.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
He backed up now to
a post where there

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:90%
was a phone, a landline phone.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
These type of landline
phones, you pick it up,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and it automatically rings
into central security control.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a landline system.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So he goes back to that
because the humanoid is still

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:90%
moving at him.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And he had already
fired one round.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It did stop.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't disable him.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
He immediately
picked up the phone

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and told the central security
control, I have an intruder.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And this intruder, I shot it.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's not stopping.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:10%
And then he watched this
intruder go right up

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:10%
to the outside perimeter
fence and just walk through it

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:10%
as if it wasn't there.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:10%
And so central
security control said,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to get
the INSAT unit.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:10%
INSAT is the Internal
Security Alert Team

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:10%
which functions inside the WSA.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's one
operating outside

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:10%
called the SAT team, of
the Security Alert Team.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:84%
The central security control
can't notify either team

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:84%
on the radio because
the radio doesn't work.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.302 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So he doesn't know
the central security control

00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
dispatcher, doesn't
know what to do,

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:84%
except to pick up a
regular phone and call

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
another team that is
at another location.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's at the alert area.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And he was able to do that.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:90%
That phone worked.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we got
a situation here.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:84%
We got an intruder that
just came into the WSA.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Our radios don't work.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:90%
We need help out here.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:10%
So another team called QRT,
or the Quick Reaction Team,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.315 align:middle line:10%
which consists of 16 security
policemen armed with M60 machine

00:08:26.315 --> 00:08:27.115 align:middle line:10%
guns--

00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:28.323 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: They were activated.

00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --they were
activated and responded.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, as they got
closer, they didn't have--

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No radio.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --radio.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No comms.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But as this thing moved
through both layers of fence--

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
now, a weapons storage area
has two different fence lines,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
an outer fence line with
concertina wire on, an inner

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:84%
fence line with
alarms underground--

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
they're called made
for miles alarms--

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and then the inner
perimeter that

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
has concertina on the
bottom and on the top.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But this humanoid
moved through both.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And now this humanoid is inside
a nuclear weapon storage area.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In the red zone.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, the security
policeman on the outside--

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to name him.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:90%
His last name was Sherman.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
He was talking still on the
radio to central security

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the INSAT team,
or the Internal Security Team,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
was close to central
security control,

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
which is located inside
the weapons storage area.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the controllers
ran out and told them,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.220 align:middle line:90%
we got a problem.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Go help.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:90%
So then he saw--

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
of course, he's
outside the perimeter.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
He sees the vehicle approach
this intruder that's walking

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:90%
towards a bunker called 222.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:90%
THE number on it is 222.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the INSAT, the
Internal Security personnel,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.543 align:middle line:84%
and the outside
person, they know

00:09:56.543 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:90%
what's inside those bunkers.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.723 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They're nuclear weapons.

00:09:59.723 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:10%
They're B28s.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:10%
They're 1.1 megaton
nuclear weapons

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.648 align:middle line:10%
that are installed on the B-52.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're
the warheads, right?

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They're the warheads.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And he could see this bunker.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And he could see the
INSAT team on the outside.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we switched to a staff
sergeant, Air Force staff

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:90%
sergeant on the inside.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:90%
He's now telling the story.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:84%
He says they see
this thing moving

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
towards the bunker doors, which
are metal doors that are sealed

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:90%
shut.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
are sealed shut

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
with not just a padlock but what
they call an arc weld on the top

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%
and on the bottom.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And those arc welds had to
be broken by a special tool

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:90%
to get in there.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And another thing within a
nuclear weapon storage area

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
or around any nuclear weapons,
there's a set procedure

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:90%
that they have to follow.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the set procedures
is a two-man concept,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
meaning two people
with equal knowledge

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:84%
has to first approach
a nuclear weapon.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Somebody with no knowledge can't
approach the nuclear weapon

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
because they could
tamper with it.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But two people with equal
knowledge could do it with.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Just so happened they had two
explosive ordnance disposal

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:84%
personnel inside the area,
inside the maintenance shop.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:90%
These are EOD.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
They're like bomb
team people that

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:90%
know all about nuclear weapons.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, they summon them to the
scene by somebody running back

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to the maintenance shop
and then coming back

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:90%
because the radios were useless.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So as this thing, this humanoid
approached this bunker,

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.240 align:middle line:90%
the doors immediately opened.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And now the bunkers open.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And this extraterrestrial
has access

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.155 align:middle line:84%
to the interior of this
nuclear weapon's bunker.

00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:48.595 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What happens next?

00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The humanoid
goes inside the bunker.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Now there's a dilemma.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a real dilemma
because what are these?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
At this point, there were
three INSAT security policemen,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:84%
a supervisor, and these two
explosive ordnance disposal

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:84%
people, a master sergeant
and a technical sergeant.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The master sergeant
and technical sergeant,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
they're armed with sidearms,
a 38-caliber model 19 six-shot

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:90%
revolver.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the master sergeant, who
was the highest ranking person

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
among all of the people that
were there, went inside.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The tech sergeant, EOD
man followed him in.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And as they went inside, the
humanoid was standing over the--

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The warheads.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --the nuclear weapon,
the warhead and had taken off

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:90%
the outer shell.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go back a little bit.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
How do you take off
an outer shell casing?

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:90%
There's 32 screws.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And there's special keys.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:84%
They're not something
a screwdriver

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
or any other type
of screwdriver open.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a special
tool to take those off.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a matter of
probably 20 seconds,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
this humanoid had
taken off that casing.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And the casing
was on the ground.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And the humanoid was doing
something at the weapon.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the master
sergeant then realized

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
that this thing could be
detonating it or whatever,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
so he immediately fired
on with his handgun.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 38, yeah.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The security
police were still outside.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But he fired all six rounds
of a six-shot revolver

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:90%
into this humanoid.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:42.585 align:middle line:84%
And other than it turning to
look at the security policeman,

00:13:42.585 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
it turned back
towards the weapon,

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
fixating directly
on that warhead.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
After the master sergeant
fired his weapon,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the other security
policeman came in.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, the Quick
Alert Team, the QAT team,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:90%
had arrived.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
have heavy weapons.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
They have grenade launchers
and M40-millimeter grenade

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:90%
launchers.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.880 align:middle line:84%
They have M60,
which is a machine

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
gun back in those days,
a 7.62 machine gun.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Now they're there.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Now there's all
this firepower there

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
trying to stop this
extraterrestrial, this humanoid

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:84%
from damaging, detonating,
or whatever it's

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:90%
doing to this nuclear weapon.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And so now there's a major
confrontation now because,

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:84%
number one, they don't
want this thing to get out.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And so at some point after some
of the other security policemen

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
fired M16s at this humanoid,
they decided to shut the door,

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.582 align:middle line:90%
seal it.

00:14:49.582 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the
arc welding thing.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to seal it
and lock it from the outside.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Now they have it trapped.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's two
problems with that.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's a
lone inside with--

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
there's actually four nuclear
weapons inside this bunker.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It's alone with these
four nuclear weapons.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Number two, could
it detonate it?

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:90%
What is its plan?

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So they started trying to
formulate a plan on the outside.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, a captain
arrived, one of the supervisors.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And he decided, we
have to do something

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to keep this thing because
he doesn't know anything

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
other than they're saying that
there's an intruder inside.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:90%
We locked him inside.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:84%
At some point later, a major
came, and a higher ranking.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Captain is one rank.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
A major is higher
than a captain.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:90%
He arrived at scene.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said, open those doors.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And get
this guy out of here.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.022 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And get this
guy out of there

00:15:43.022 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
because we can't
have him inside.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:10%
So when they opened the
door, it was right--

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:10%
as soon as they opened
the door, the humanoid

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.105 align:middle line:10%
was standing right
there by the door.

00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But they could see
holes from the bullets

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that they fired at
it and including

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:90%
one up in the helmet area.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't seem like
the one in the helmet area

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:90%
had penetrated.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:90%
There was just a mark there.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So they tried then
physical restrainment,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
getting the biggest guys to
go in and try to restrain

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:90%
him and put handcuffs on.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, that didn't work.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Two of the security policemen
were injured, pushed away.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing
started spinning.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It put its arms out
and started spinning.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, at this point and
later on the analysis,

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:10%
the after-action
reports determined

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:10%
that this thing probably
wasn't a biological creature.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a robot because none
of the bullets harmed him.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And this is 1971.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know a whole lot about
extraterrestrials at the time.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:90%
We knew some.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But none of these
security policemen

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
were ever briefed
into any of that.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And so as it was spinning,
anything that got in its way,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.870 align:middle line:90%
it would be harmed or killed.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
So it spun out into
the open on a road.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:10%
And there was two vehicles
there, an armored vehicle.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:10%
They call it an M706.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:10%
It's like an armored vehicle
that the QRT came in.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, the driver of
the QRT then decided

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to ram the creature
or the humanoid.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So he accelerated and
ran right into it,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:84%
knocking it over,
rolling over it.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing
moved all the way out

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to the perimeter fences,
back into the UFO,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:90%
which was parked out there.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
As they turned around,
there was two more humanoids

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:90%
going in that bunker.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.735 align:middle line:84%
Now they got three
of these things.

00:17:44.735 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Similar to that one?

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.055 align:middle line:10%
Exactly like that
one or different?

00:17:48.055 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, exactly like that
one, the exact same humanoid

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrial creature,
whatever you want to call it.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And so as those two went
into the bunker, then

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:90%
they had to think quick.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's set up the
M60 machine gun.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't fired the
M60 machine gun yet.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's a machine gun.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.593 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's the heaviest
one we had back then.

00:18:10.593 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Back then,
Yeah, and a 7.62 round.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they set it up
outside and they fired in.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know some people were
probably going to say, well,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
you're shooting at
a nuclear weapon.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Bullets are not going to
harm a nuclear weapon.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, not at all.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No way they're
going to set that off.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they were firing
at these two humanoids

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:90%
that's inside the bunker.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And although they
disabled one, dropping it,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.100 align:middle line:84%
it fell to the ground,
the other one wasn't.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And as that other one did
whatever it was meant to do

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the objective
was, then started spinning

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:90%
and came out.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
That moved all the way out
to the perimeter fences

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:90%
and then went back into the UFO.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.068 align:middle line:84%
And Sherman, who was on
the outside, fired his--

00:19:00.068 --> 00:19:00.985 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Again, right.

00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In fact, he used up
his entire 20-round magazine.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:84%
They had two magazines,
which is like the clip goes

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
into the weapon, 20
rounds in each magazine.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's all the load
that they carry out there.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.385 align:middle line:84%
He fired one complete
magazine, 20 rounds--

00:19:16.385 --> 00:19:17.225 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 223.

00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --223 caliber.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Never affected it.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.605 align:middle line:84%
But they still have
now one inside.

00:19:23.605 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The third one went
out of the weapon storage unit.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was spinning.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:90%
And it went through the fence.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Physically, did the fence get
damaged, or did it bleed through

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:90%
like the other one?

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was as
if it dematerialized

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and rematerialized.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.330 align:middle line:90%
The fences were never damaged.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot of pictures
taken later regarding this.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
There was no damage
to the fence.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And there was an alarm system,
an underground alarm system,

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:90%
very sophisticated.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:90%
They call it made for miles.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Anything that touches the
ground or goes over that alarm

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:90%
should have activated.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that activated
was the alarm on the bunker.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:84%
The alarm on the
bunker did activate.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But that was after
the thing opened.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.696 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It went through.

00:20:08.696 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But there was
no damage to the fence.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
That third one went
back to the UFO.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the one
still inside the area.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So now they're
trying to get rope.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And they decided now as the
master sergeant goes back

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:84%
to the maintenance building,
they had these heavy cables.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to bring
some of those out

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:90%
to try to wrap them up.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:90%
They put a tarp over it.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:90%
And they wrapped it up.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So now it's secure
as they could get it.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And now they don't
know what to do.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, the UFO then took off.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:10%
As it took off and
flew northwest,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:10%
the communication
system came back on.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Now they can talk on the radio.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're asking
for assistance

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.465 align:middle line:84%
from a commander or somebody
else above the rank of major.

00:21:00.465 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the major was
there orchestrating everything.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It was out of his
control at this point.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.658 align:middle line:84%
And now he's trying to
get permission for what?

00:21:06.658 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He's trying
to get an answer

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to what to do with this
humanoid that we have here

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and probably, as he says later,
an alien from another planet.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's his words.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the commander,
a lieutenant colonel,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
he's the commander of the
42nd Security Police Squadron.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's the security
police squadron

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that's protecting this
alert area and the WSA area.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
He eventually comes out
with the wing commander.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And now the wing commander
is a one-star general.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And now they're trying
to figure out what to do.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So they initiated what they
call from a helping hand, which

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
is an incident involving
a nuclear weapon,

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
to a covered wagon,
which is another higher

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
incident involving a nuclear
weapon, to higher headquarters.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So it went to SAC headquarters,
which is at that time

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
an Offutt Air Force
Base in Nebraska.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And they said, anything
you can imagine

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
to do to detain that thing
and hold that until we

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:90%
can get the right force there.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, unbeknownst to that team
there, we did have something.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:10%
And that was part of the SDART,
the Special Down Aircraft

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:10%
Recovery Team, because
they were trained

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:10%
in recovering not
just the craft,

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:10%
but the occupants of the craft.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So they considered this
part of an SDART operation.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
They then brought in a
forklift because this thing

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
is heavy, a forklift and a
flatbed truck to put it on.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
What they were going to
do, they had larger bunkers

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and a conventional storage area,
meaning a storage area that

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:84%
had conventional nonnuclear
weapons like ammunition

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And so they were going to
put it on this flatbed,

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
take it out of the
weapon storage area,

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.680 align:middle line:84%
take it over to the
conventional storage area, which

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
was some pretty close distance
from the weapon storage area

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and put the truck and
everything inside the bunker

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and then try to seal it.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And so while they were doing
this, the UFO returned.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: This time, the UFO flew
right over the storage area.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Now it's hovering right over
its occupant, the humanoid.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Now they don't know what to do.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So the squadron commander,
who was a lieutenant colonel,

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.935 align:middle line:84%
ordered the machine gun
guy with the M60 to--

00:23:34.935 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Light it up.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --shooting
at that thing.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Empty everything he had.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And he had, I think, 350
rounds or something like that.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Two belts.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And he started shooting at it.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, it shot back.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It shot something back that
totally disabled the M60 machine

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:90%
gun.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.255 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: But did it hurt anyone?

00:23:52.255 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It didn't hurt anybody.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Just the machine.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.478 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, there was
already two security policemen

00:23:56.478 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
injured because of the
first one spinning.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were
trying to detain it.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:90%
So there's two.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
That's some broken
arms or something.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And now when this
beam or something

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
was shot down to disable
this M60 machine gun,

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:84%
now they have to
think of more tactics.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So there was alert
aircrafts on duty

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.295 align:middle line:84%
at Dow Air Force Base in
Maine, in Bangor, Maine.

00:24:19.295 --> 00:24:22.400 align:middle line:90%
They were F-106s.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But they had air-to-air rockets,
not air-to-ground rockets.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And they also carried
nuclear weapons.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But they sent two
nonnuclear alert aircrafts

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
down there to try to shoot this
thing down because what else are

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
they going to do?

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle of a
battle between our forces

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.490 align:middle line:90%
and whatever is in that craft.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.040 align:middle line:10%
And so they did
everything they could do.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:90%
This thing hovered over.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, everyone that was
trying to load that humanoid

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:90%
onto that flatbed moved back.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, everybody got
back because they

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:84%
realized they have
a technology that's

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in this flying saucer
that's hovering

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:84%
above them is well more
advanced than anything we have.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And since the M60
machine gun is disabled,

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
these M60 machine guns
that fire a small around

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:90%
isn't going to work.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:10%
So the commander ordered
everyone back and actually put

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:10%
everybody in a bunker.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so during the time
that they were isolating,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:84%
waiting for reinforcements,
and what they did was

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
they recalled the
security police squadron,

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
meaning everybody in that
security police squadron

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
that lives in those
barracks were recalled.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Get up.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Get ready.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Get your weapons.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And get out there because
we got a battle going on.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And so at some point, when
the aircrafts got there--

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and it took like 30 minutes--

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:90%
the craft was going away.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It didn't take their--

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And when they went out to look
at the flatbed, which they had

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
already lifted the
humanoid up with a forklift

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the flatbed
but they didn't have a chance

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
to drive out of there,
when they came out,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
they noticed that
humanoid was gone.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.025 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what about
the nuclear warheads?

00:26:07.025 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: One of the nuclear
warheads was missing.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, the strange
thing about this

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:90%
is how did that nuclear weapon--

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:90%
and I can't go into it.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But there's
procedures in the way

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that those weapons are
stored inside the bunker.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
They shouldn't have
been able to be moved.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:90%
And there's reasons for that.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But this one that they'd
already tampered with

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and took the cone off, that
nose cone off, was missing.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this presents a major
problem within the United States

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:90%
military.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:90%
They lost a nuclear weapon.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:84%
What are they going to
do with a nuclear weapon?

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know who
took the nuclear weapon.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:55.946 align:middle line:84%
Was it the Russians dressed up,
the Soviets back in that day?

00:26:55.946 --> 00:27:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So they launched three more
sets of aircrafts, F-106s.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they were
flying north in New Brunswick.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:84%
The Canadian Forces have
their own alert aircraft.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They were the 101s,
seconds, the Voodoos.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And they launched
their aircraft.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They caught up with this thing
going up towards Labrador.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And they fired
everything they had,

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:84%
the air-to-air
missiles, which was,

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I think, Falcon missiles
back in the days.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Falcon
missiles, correct.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And they
disabled this thing.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But the thing made it into the
Atlantic Ocean and sunk there.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any Canadian
Naval Force or American Naval

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Force in close proximity.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It took some hours
for a naval force--

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was the
Canadian Coast Guard--

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to get to the location
where it was in the water.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:90%
But it was gone.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:84%
They would have to do
some kind of recovery.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But what they did find
was a nuclear weapon.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:84%
They jettisoned
that nuclear weapon.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, those weapons are gravity
bombs with a parachute.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we launch them, we drop
them over target out of a B-52,

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:84%
they are set to deploy the
parachute and then detonate

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:90%
at an altitude of 1,100 feet.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And this thing jettisoned
or they threw it out.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And the parachute deployed.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:90%
And it landed on the ground.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And they located
this nuclear weapon.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Now they have a problem.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.676 align:middle line:90%
Is this thing ready to detonate?

00:28:36.676 --> 00:28:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is it armed?

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.235 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now we have a major
problem inside another country

00:28:42.235 --> 00:28:43.035 align:middle line:90%
in Canada.

00:28:43.035 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, the naval
forces, I do recall get there.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And I heard they did not
find the craft down there.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:90%
It was not down there.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, they
didn't find it.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:90%
They never found the craft.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:90%
They searched.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Eventually they got underwater.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.630 align:middle line:90%
They got submarines there.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.713 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they get any
pieces of the craft that

00:29:00.713 --> 00:29:02.705 align:middle line:90%
fell off during the big fight?

00:29:02.705 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They did.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:04.840 align:middle line:90%
They got something.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They think it's a large ball
with a small protrusion on it.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And they think that's
some sort of an antenna.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But again, the technology
is not something we

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:90%
knew or could figure out then.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they did not get
any pieces of the beings at all?

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They didn't get
any pieces of the beings.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was left inside
the weapons storage area

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.790 align:middle line:84%
from the confrontation they
had with the extraterrestrial.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And so when they found
the nuclear weapon,

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.620 align:middle line:84%
they immediately then
notified a recovery team.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.030 align:middle line:84%
The SAC has a nuclear response,
nuclear disablement team,

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:90%
they call them, would come in.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But they found that the
nuclear weapon was already

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:84%
rendered safe, meaning
it couldn't detonate.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.012 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what was the
outcome of the event?

00:29:53.012 --> 00:29:54.345 align:middle line:90%
What did they find out later on?

00:29:54.345 --> 00:29:56.020 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Well, they
found out, first

00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:10%
of all, that the weapon
system, the B28 that

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:10%
was jettisoned by
the extraterrestrial,

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:10%
was virtually an inert weapon.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:10%
The X unit, which is a
firing unit inside-- that's

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:10%
not classified-- inside
the nuclear weapon

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.420 align:middle line:10%
was gone, missing.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:10%
There were some MC components,
or military components,

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:10%
that were use to generate a
signal to help detonate it.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.885 align:middle line:90%
They were gone.

00:30:23.885 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:84%
They must have been
stolen because they

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.920 align:middle line:90%
weren't in the bunker.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:10%
So what they figured out
was this particular species

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrials
went in there

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:10%
to disable a nuclear weapon.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, was that to
tell us that they

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:84%
know all about our
nuclear weapons

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and they know how
to disable them?

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And we think that's
exactly what they did.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:84%
They jeopardized maybe
some of their own

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to teach us a lesson to
say, don't use these things.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.160 align:middle line:90%
We know how to disable them.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the message
that we, as a government,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:90%
received.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They came.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.660 align:middle line:90%
They invaded us.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.540 align:middle line:90%
They took one of our warheads.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:90%
But they did not activate it.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:84%
They did not try to
hurt us until we started

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.666 align:middle line:90%
initiating combat protocol.

00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, I guess they--

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I guess maybe they
didn't understand

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
exactly what a weapon storage
area and how it was guarded.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
extraterrestrials.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.673 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
maybe they could just

00:31:26.673 --> 00:31:31.212 align:middle line:84%
land and go in and take one and
disable it and leave it there.

00:31:31.212 --> 00:31:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But they took this one probably
because of the confrontation

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:90%
that was occurring.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't expect that.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But I think they learned their
lesson from that 1971 incident.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.415 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I can
see that actually.

00:31:42.415 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And based
on this incident,

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
there were new features
and new designs

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
created for nuclear bunkers
and nuclear weapon storage.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, all that
stuff is still classified.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to talk about it.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
advanced techniques

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.720 align:middle line:90%
used to secure nuclear weapons.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So no one, I mean, no one from
this world or any other world

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.150 align:middle line:84%
could get in and steal
a nuclear weapon.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Richard, that's one
of my most favorite stories.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
remarkable that you

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:84%
were able to interview these
guys and read these reports.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing with us.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:23.175 align:middle line:90%
It was a great story.

00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:25.092 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Thanks for being
on the show as well.

00:32:25.092 --> 00:32:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: You're welcome.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
