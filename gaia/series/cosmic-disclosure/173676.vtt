>> DAVID WILCOCK: All right,
welcome back to Cosmic

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:10%
Disclosure.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.682 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
here with Emery Smith.

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode,
we're going to start

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
talking about underground
civilizations.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back to the show.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH:
Thank you, David.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: In the past, you've
talked to me about a very

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
interesting technology that
apparently can see quite a bit

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
more below the surface
of the earth than what

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
our conventional scientists
would think is possible,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:84%
so could you talk a little
bit about that first.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, sure.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it all started
using satellites, of course

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:10%
looking into the oceans.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the astronauts
also while orbiting,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
would look into
the oceans and see

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
these crashed, old wreckages,
and ships that they knew,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of course, had a
lot of gold in them.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
And treasure
hunters also started

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the
inside governments

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to buy time on these
amazing satellites that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%
could see these things.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So this is not
something that conventional

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:90%
people have access to.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:90%
No, they don't.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: This is
an insider thing.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.272 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's an insider thing.

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple
of organizations

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
that do own satellites, or
private corporations that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
use them for looking into
walls to see if they're

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
infested in foreign countries
with like insects and bugs,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So they can see, actually,
inside a wall from a satellite

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and see what kind of bug it is
and tell you what kind of bug

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So that has now been
an advance to look

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:90%
into the ground, a little bit.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But they have developed
a special radar, now.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a ground penetrating, low
frequency, back-scattered wave

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:84%
pattern device, which gives
you a volumetric image that's

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
about 400 times better
than a CAT scan.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually see
what it is and you can also

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
tell what type of material
it is, which is very helpful.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, in Saudi Arabia,
for the Kings there,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
if they have a backpack bomber
running down their driveway,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
they could just basically fly
the drone over it or shoot

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
the wave at them, and they
know how much explosives he has

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
in his backpack before
he even--you know--

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:90%
gets near the compound.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So this type of device
has been used by the military

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and for the DOD.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I can't say who has this or--

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:90%
but it is privately owned.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.772 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: One
question, real quick.

00:02:38.772 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So we have the periodic
table of the elements--

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:90%
we're up to 120 something.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.869 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Are there certain
elements that you can't see

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:90%
with this?

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Or how does work?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.568 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: If it's not elements
that have already been

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
discovered, you will
not know what is--

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
the way that comes back will be
unknown, or unknown from earth.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the
rest of the periodic--

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.288 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Everything
is logged into this.

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Like a rife machine
with frequencies,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
they have done the same
thing with this device.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So they have measured
every type of element

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is, and have measured
how that frequency comes back.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why they can build,
not only a volumetric image,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
but actually tell you
exactly what it is.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
A good-- one of the great things
about this device is I can put

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
it on a drone, fly
out to an oil tanker--

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and this is the test we did--

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and in one of those
giant tankers that

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
hold hundreds of thousands
of gallons of oil,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
we could put a small amount of
uranium inside a sealed box,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
inside a 55 gallon
oil drum, drop it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of
this tanker, and fly

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
this drone over 10 miles
before it even gets into port,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and it will tell you exactly
where that uranium is

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and what it is and
where on the ship it is.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It's that detailed.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very amazing, useful,
protective thing we have,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that I hope many
people listen to this.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:90%
And I hope the--

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
POTUS kind of knows about
it, but doesn't know about it

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:90%
kind of thing.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think this would help him
in the fight against terror,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
because this way it
will scan everything

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.469 align:middle line:84%
and you will know everything
before it even happens.

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's a very-- so
when we were hired, my team,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
to go out to look for, in
an undisclosed location

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.030 align:middle line:84%
in the United States of America,
to go remote view an area that

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:90%
has been known--

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
has been getting these hits
of a possible gold reservoir,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
we went out and met
with the scientists

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and this amazing
team, and they were

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
looking for a special
treasure, I'll say.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And, I can get into that later.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.878 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, they were
looking for a special treasure.

00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
They hired a colleague, a
couple colleagues of mine

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and myself, to go out
there and to first

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
lay the flags on the mountain
where we thought it was.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And we were--

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Yeah, and let
me just say Emery that--

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
for you folks watching
this don't know this,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:90%
but you and I do--

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I actually got to
talk to your team.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So this was not just something
that I'm hearing from you now.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's true.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And it was something
we were very involved

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:90%
in for a while.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes you were.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So what had happened
is we went out there,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
we laid down the flags, they
ran this special radar over it,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and we were 99.9%
percent effective.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:90%
So we--

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: In what?

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.962 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: In finding out
where the gold was at.

00:05:30.962 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So there was
a large amount of gold--

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: A large
amount of gold.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:84%
They were after these
treasure hunters

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that was working
with the government,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:90%
I believe, maybe, maybe not.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a speculation.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.241 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But the really
cool part of the story--

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The really cool part
of the story is a scientist

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
called me in that
developed this system--

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:84%
an amazing person-- and my
team in, and sat us down,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:90%
a few of us, and said--

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
showed us this giant void
underneath the earth where--

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:90%
way deep below the gold.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were like, well, what's
this giant hollow space here?

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:90%
And what is that giant pyramid?

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:90%
And he said, how did you--

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:90%
how did you know about that?

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
How did you-- did you
go through my files?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, but we saw it
when we remote viewed it.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why didn't
you write that in your report?

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.442 align:middle line:84%
He says, because it came
back unknown elements.

00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only out here to do
one thing, and that's to find--

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:90%
to confirm the gold.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is the most
amazing, groundbreaking thing

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, yeah,
well, with my device,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I can see all the
way through the earth

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and see everything
in the earth, so

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
just think what I
have already seen

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and what am I going to
do with this information.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This was the same
technology they

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
used to find the tunnels
in Mexico that were

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:90%
coming through the borders.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:90%
They used this technology.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Mexican cartel actually
put a hit out for this man

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
because they found out, because
the government was already

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:90%
infiltrated as well.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:90%
So even though he saved US--

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, bless this
man that he had helped

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and came to the forefront and
saved US with his technology.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:84%
He also almost
got killed for it.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So we found, not only
that, but we also

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
found a lot of other
interesting things,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramid there were
like 10 times the size of Giza.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very big void,
here, in North America.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.255 align:middle line:84%
A very large, large
area and a large aquifer

00:07:29.255 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:90%
kind of surrounding it.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.846 align:middle line:90%
And its own atmosphere.

00:07:33.846 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And he can measure
atmospheric pressure, too,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:90%
which was interesting.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So with this device, he can
do so many different things.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are civilizations,
I can confirm,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that have their own atmosphere,
their own luminescence,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
their own life, and their
own water supply that

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.575 align:middle line:90%
are deep within the earth.

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, you also
had mentioned to me,

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:84%
when we talked about this
before, that there were some,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe, cubicle rooms
that you guys found,

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have any
entrances or exits.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That was the
very interesting thing.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:84%
The back-scatter radar,
low-frequency radar actually

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:90%
showed cubes--

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
these giant cubed rooms and
small cubed rooms of emptiness

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
that were perfectly cut.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We measure using-- we
can measure exactly

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to the millimeter how
big these rooms are

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and how small they are and they
were cut like perfect cubes.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And this bedrock-- we're
talking about 1,000 feet down

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:90%
to 3,500 feet down.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's like how on earth
are these cubes down there,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:90%
near this area, by the way?

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there is something
inside those cubes,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have the technology
to see it or to analyze it,

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
because it just comes
back as unknown.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the elements
that we discovered--

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
that why we were called
in, and some of the things

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:84%
they found down there was a huge
reservoir of pure white gold.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:90%
White gold, not meaning--

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
the gold that is mixed with
metal today, like white gold

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:90%
on your chains--

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about from
ancient civilization,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:90%
white gold--the powder--

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:90%
the mana.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.361 align:middle line:90%
The mana that you hear about.

00:09:16.361 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And you said, when
we were talking about the smart

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.585 align:middle line:84%
suits, that there was a white
gold fuel that would create

00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:90%
antigravity in the smart suit.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That is correct.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Is that the
same type of stuff?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was
interesting, because--

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I mean, this
was very fascinating.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.986 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: --the government moved
right in and bought pretty much

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
all the property up until
this part of this land,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:84%
which is a really
great confirmation.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I also remember you showing me
some of the volumetric imaging

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
of what clearly appeared
to be a stairwell that

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:90%
had been back-filled.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:90%
So could you talk about that?

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, we
found giant stairwells,

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:90%
underneath the ground.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And these giant, huge
voids-- we're talking,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of acres that

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:90%
go on for thousands of miles.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And these are not just caverns.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.166 align:middle line:84%
They're caverns,
but they're also

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
something different
about them, because there

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:84%
are certain parts of the caverns
that you can't make it up

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:90%
where there's an actual steps--

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
steps going thousands
of feet down--

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:90%
perfect steps.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
We did find the outlines
of craft and also

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:25.026 align:middle line:90%
a large sarcophagi.

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So do you think these
were giant humans of some kind?

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:90%
They were about 30-33 feet tall.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So, that's the older
stuff, for sure.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But we did find something on
the radar that was really cool,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was in the
middle of the aquifer

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:84%
was a large, large
rock that did not

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
look like it was
connected to the mainland.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was just there.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.587 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking a few miles--

00:10:51.587 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Like a boulder,
a massive boulder.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So imagine water
going over the boulder

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and the boulder was hollow and
did have a type of ruins in it.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh, Wow.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
that we needed the suits

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
was actually to
drill and then go

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
through the aquifer with the
suits and then drill into that.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is we
didn't want to flood it.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't find out a way how
not to flood the giant egg.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.627 align:middle line:84%
Because that would wash
away all the white gold.

00:11:21.627 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: The white
gold was inside the egg?

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: In that egg, yes.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.702 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And it
was all submerged?

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So how would your
smart suit help you to get

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:90%
into the egg?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Could you just bore through
it with the suit or something?

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.269 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, there's a way
that you could bring equipment

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and bore through it, but
you couldn't-- the thing is,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to find out if there
was an air cavity somewhere

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Because for some reason,
we couldn't find that.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So-- but there was
a part of the rock

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that was close to the surface
of earth that was touching.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:90%
So we figured, you know--

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and once we did drill through,
water started coming out.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was only three
feet to the giant rock.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have billions of
pounds of water coming

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
through this little
hole you just

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
dug down deep into the
earth to get into this egg.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And now you have three
feet preventing you

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:90%
from getting into the egg.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:90%
So how do you--

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
so what we decided
was let's bring down

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
billions of gallons
of liquid nitrogen,

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
freeze that part of the
aquifer, then drill through it,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:90%
and then go in.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you think this
egg was actually, maybe,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
some kind of hollowed
out asteroid,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and they could have phase
shifted it and landed it inside

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:90%
the earth?

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I think,
that at one time,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
it was an asteroid and
that somehow it was formed

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to the earth, probably through
molten lava or something.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And over millions-- over
years, the water somehow

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:90%
broke it off from the earth.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just kind of
in this area surrounded

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:90%
by three feet of water.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about a
very highly pressurized area.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wait a minute.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
An asteroid would have
come from the solar system.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying, you think
it formed in the earth?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well I think
it came a long time ago.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
People found this
as a safe haven.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Oh, it was a
crashed asteroid to the earth,

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
from ancient times, and it's
a massive boulder basically

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
inside the earth that they
found and could hollow out.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
It was probably-- it
could have-- right.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.929 align:middle line:84%
They probably hollowed out, or
could have been hollowed out.

00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, for hundreds and
hundreds or thousands of years,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
people were just putting
their treasures in there

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're safe stuff,
through a very long time.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, I think
now, it's just a--

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:84%
earth itself has
just consolidated it

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:84%
in a place where it's very,
very difficult to get to.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I mean, you're being
sort of intriguingly vague when

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
you say ruins and civilization,
could you be a little more

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.612 align:middle line:84%
specific about what's
inside the egg?

00:13:52.612 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:84%
What would we see if we got
to ever see this someday?

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, in that egg
are those steps that we talked

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So we do have the
volumetric imaging for that.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So there are steps leading
down into this giant cavity.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is the
water getting in there.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Now to get into more of
what is exactly in there,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I already told you there is a
craft, there's a sarcophagi.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was talking
about was this cavity.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And this was some
kind of race of giants, then?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, at one time.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But over time, I
think, people thought

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
this was a special place.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And also inside this giant
asteroid or whatever it is--

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's an
asteroid, just so you know,

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
because when the back-scatter
things come back,

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
we get a lot of
different minerals

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%
there and different things.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.095 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't see a
huge amount of iron.

00:14:51.095 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's just weird
that this thing

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:84%
is a giant, hollowed out rock
in the middle of the aquifer.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of just intriguing.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:84%
This is just speculation
that it is an asteroid--

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:90%
we think, maybe, maybe not.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And so inside this, we have
seen many remains of humans--

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:90%
over 300 remains of humans.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
We have seen also armor.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
We've seen, of course,
caches of gold,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
the world's largest barge
could not even hold.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
To the side of this giant area,
which is very high, as well,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.172 align:middle line:90%
inside, it's split up.

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just like
one big giant area.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You have other
areas, like I said.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The cubes, also, are
around the outside of that

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:90%
and on the inside of this thing.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's solid
parts inside this egg.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:90%
It's called the egg.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And inside that, are many
different types of tunnels,

00:15:54.270 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and hollowed out areas, and
pyramids, and sarcophagis,

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:90%
and craft, and other things.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Is there anything
unusual about the skeletons,

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:90%
besides maybe their size?

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well the armor and
the pots that we have seen full

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of gold are the same ones
they've used back around

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:90%
the Knights Templar era.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So we have a good
feeling that this is where

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:84%
possibly the Ark of the Covenant
and the Holy Grail and 1700

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:90%
tablets--

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:90%
stone tablets are there.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So you think it's
possible that the Knight

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Templar people might have known
about this, perhaps, through,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
who knows what-- ancient texts,
or surviving extraterrestrials

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
they were in contact with.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.904 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I can tell
you how they knew about it.

00:16:50.904 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: How did they know?

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: There is a small
percentage of humans who can

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:84%
see in a special
blue light spectrum.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
this gold emanates

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:84%
through the earth and foliage,
and they can see this hue.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.272 align:middle line:90%
They have this special ability.

00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You could probably-- I've
never read about it online.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
I've just been debriefed
about it in the military.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And people are
like this are used

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
to find huge gold
reservoirs and also do

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
other things around the world,
to help America and keep

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:90%
it safe.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And they have, through
satellites, found

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
a ping in this particular
area of North America.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And back then, the Indians
and the people over--

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
even if you are in Europe, and
they could see over the horizon

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:90%
this blue exact hue.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So they would sail all the way
to this place, find the gold,

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
get the gold, and they
were very successful.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:90%
So they kept going.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they landed
in Corpus Christi--

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:84%
one of the ships from
the Knights Templar.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
We believe that they
trekked in somewhere up

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:84%
into North America,
which I can't disclose,

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and then buried it in this area
that already had the world's

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.329 align:middle line:84%
largest gold reservoir,
because they thought

00:18:04.329 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:90%
this would be the safest place.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.745 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Very interesting.

00:18:06.745 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because they were
worried that during the war,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that they better move-- the
Sinclair family took all

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the money and helped pay for the
ships and the Templars helped

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.985 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars stayed to
protect the gold till death.

00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: One of the other
things I've heard that I think

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
is really important
to bring up right now,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.380 align:middle line:84%
is several insiders have
talked about the Sahara Desert,

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
the northern third of Africa.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's all a big desert
now, but they have all

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:44.110 align:middle line:84%
said that if you go anywhere
between 40 to 400 feet down

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
in that sand, that
it is just amazing,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.857 align:middle line:84%
and it's everywhere-- massive
ruins of a civilization.

00:18:52.857 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about this?

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I have
heard about this.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What do
you know about it?

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: All I know is they did
that with a ground penetrating

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:90%
radar from a satellite.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It was very simple,
because it wasn't deep.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And things that are not too deep
they can actually see through,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount,
especially sand.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's harder with bedrock.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
anomalies right there

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that have exactly
what you just said.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And I heard that--

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that's not second-hand
information.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I overheard that while
I was in a briefing that

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
had to do with something
else over in that country.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: How prevalent do you
think these voids of cubicle

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:90%
rooms are?

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Like-- you only
looked at one place.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that most
of the places we look,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
we might find that
kind of stuff?

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I think this
is a significant area.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And just so you know, this
is hundreds and hundreds

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:84%
of square miles of area
that we have checked out.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.651 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like
one certain area.

00:19:48.651 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But that's a very small
part of the planet

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm getting at.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And there was
significant enough data

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
there to prove that there
was a civilization there

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and it is connected
to other civilizations

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and other tunnels.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And that the major aquifers
under ground are all connected,

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
which is very scary, which
we never did know about.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So if the water does
get contaminated,

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
let's say in Wisconsin or in
North Dakota, South Dakota,

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
eventually over many, many,
many, many years all of it

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:90%
could be contaminated.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So there is an underwater
system of travel, as well,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:90%
that links all these things.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: We've heard,
from certain insiders,

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that there is a traversable
underwater channel that can go

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
from the West Coast of the
United States all the way

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
to Nebraska and that there's a
significant military base there

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.365 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of how they
access it, is underwater.

00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, that's true.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
military's been going

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.325 align:middle line:84%
from the east and west
coast using the aquifers

00:20:54.325 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I like the Naval
sea base that's in the middle

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:90%
of Nevada there.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:90%
What's that one called?

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:10%
You drive by on the way
to Vegas, or whatever.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: John Lear said that
was a submarine repair base.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know the Lear family.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely true.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
stopping station.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And it does go all
the way across.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the map for that.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely 100% know
it goes all the way across,

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
secret study done using

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle line:90%
special dyes that they used.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's some-- a group
went in there--a private

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
organization and tainted the
water and the water off San

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Diego with these
special molecules--

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.156 align:middle line:84%
very organic--
couldn't hurt anything.

00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And then it was about
a few weeks later

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:84%
they did collect them
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's definitely-- has a--

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:84%
some sort of
throughway-- thorough way

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:90%
through that entire place.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Would you say that
even people serving on like

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:84%
a nuclear sub might be
using these routinely?

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, I believe so.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And also a lot of
clandestine stuff

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:90%
is-- that are being used for.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's bases, also, on the
way there that are underground.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now, I want to
get into this a, little bit,

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
because you had some really
interesting stuff to say about

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.482 align:middle line:84%
how this weird technology
was first developed.

00:22:20.482 --> 00:22:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The technology we
were talking about earlier with

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
a low-frequency ground
penetrating ray are also can be

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:90%
used--

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
it can actually be
fit inside an iPhone.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can place this on
your hand or on your chest

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and it'll show you your hand
and you can zoom in all the way

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
to the actual cell and say, all
right, I have three cells here

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:90%
next to him.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:90%
This one's metastatic.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a cancer cell.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a tissue
cell, and then zap it.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And now you've just
cured yourself of cancer.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's that-- the resolution
on this device is that amazing.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
just put it on your hand

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.202 align:middle line:84%
and then zoom right in to the
cell itself and move around.

00:23:08.202 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: That's great.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.201 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's beautiful.

00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
The most beautiful
technology ever.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's available.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just sitting there.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that this talk
will inspire the inventor

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and POTUS to step up on
that, because not only

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:84%
is it a great security
thing for the world,

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a good
thing for health.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing,
beautiful thing to help--

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:90%
you could heal yourself.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And I
assume that this,

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:84%
whatever energy it uses is
not radioactive or harmful?

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No, it's not--

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:90%
correct.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.065 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now, I think you
had me on the phone with

00:23:44.065 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the inventor, at one point, and
he just about screwed my head

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
off explaining how this
technology got developed

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
in the first place, the
essence of metals or materials

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:84%
in the periodic table,
and how it sees that.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember any of
that stuff-- what he said?

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm having
trouble remembering--

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:84%
it was a very complex
technical discussion.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I mean there's
only, as far as I know, one,

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
two, three people--

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
including me-- that know how
the system operates and actually

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not at
liberty to really talk

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
about that out loud,
for many reasons,

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:84%
also safety for everyone
else on the planet.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:84%
If it gets in the wrong hands,
too, you have to be careful.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like other amazing
energy devices and stuff,

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and portals, and
antigrav, and stuff.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything comes
with also a risk,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and this inventor
knows that very well.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And this inventor was
saved from another country,

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and is now a US
citizen, and wants

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:84%
to help US first,
and protect US,

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:90%
and protect him and his family.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And he's-- the poor guy has
been through heck, of course.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, the only
thing I can tell you,

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:84%
is it uses a very,
very low frequency--

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
back-scattered wave,
we call it-- pattern.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And it shoots back
these algorithms.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he's the only
one that has the program.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And only two other
people, that I know--

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I remember you telling
me something funny about how--

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:84%
like, the government has
to come to him because he's

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:90%
the only guy that has it.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.069 align:middle line:84%
So could you talk a
little bit about how--

00:25:17.069 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
what was his relationship with
the government as the inventor

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:90%
of this technology?

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They're very
upset that they will not--

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
he will not sell this invention.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Because he is
waiting for the Cabal

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to be destroyed before
giving it to POTUS,

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:90%
or giving it to the right hands.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Because he is worried that
we're still not stable yet.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So he's very aware that we're
still children and not--

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be able to handle this.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But he did use it for
the Mexican tunnels

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and some other amazing
clandestine projects

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:90%
to protect America.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of things going on

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:90%
that people don't realize--

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
inside information, like
backpack nuclear bombs

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
coming up through Mexico
and things like that.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And this product
would immediately

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.830 align:middle line:84%
be able to pinpoint these
things hundreds of miles

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:90%
before they even get here.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we could take
precautionary methods

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that these nukes
and things do not

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.590 align:middle line:90%
make it through our borders.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the team
and the military and POTUS

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.049 align:middle line:90%
are working on.

00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're not allowed
to talk about that,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want to
scare the American people.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Why he's building a
wall-- or who is doing--

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:84%
why is the military out
to sea at this area?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard for them to
bring this to the people,

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
because if the enemy
knows that you know,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to
change everything around.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
It's at a level now where
it's just who you know

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and what the device is
going to be used for.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:84%
As you know, this
scientist has no interest

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:90%
in billions of dollars.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.130 align:middle line:84%
He's more worried about the
safety of the United States

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:90%
citizens.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to make sure when
he does turn this over, that--

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and he has to be
there every shooting--

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:84%
every-- when we
scan the ground, he

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.234 align:middle line:84%
has to be the one
doing it, of course.

00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:12.066 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: All right.

00:27:12.066 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's so
many questions here.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have to pick
this up again next time.
