00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.517 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm really excited about
this conversation today.

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:05.090 align:middle line:84%
This is like next level stuff
that no other whistleblower

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.150 align:middle line:90%
is talking about.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.620 align:middle line:10%
>> It was such a strange
thing to witness.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.866 align:middle line:84%
He goes, yeah, this is from the
craft they've had since 1940s.

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Take it from
behind the scenes,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.683 align:middle line:10%
put it into the public
sphere, getting the data.

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about hard data.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.202 align:middle line:84%
They want disclosure
to be definite.

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the tools that's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.102 align:middle line:90%
going to help facilitate that.

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>> They will be able to fast
forward science hundreds

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
of years.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.255 align:middle line:84%
>> You're the guy
who found the sphere.

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little nervous.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.792 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest.

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's part of disclosure.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I'm here
on Gaia trying to explain.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> --Everything around it
to change because it has

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.265 align:middle line:90%
to because we are all connected.

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Josh Golembeski, your
guest host of Cosmic Disclosure.
