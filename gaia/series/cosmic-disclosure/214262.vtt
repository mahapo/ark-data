>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by
Victoria Whitney,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.870 align:middle line:10%
a Doctor of Science and a
retired member of the United

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:10%
States Navy
Department of Defense.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.010 align:middle line:10%
She has worked as an
environmental engineer

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:10%
and scientist in special
programs and projects

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:10%
and is an expert at
extraterrestrial and crash site

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:10%
investigations.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're discussing the role
of the Pleiadians and the Orions

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
within the United
Galactic Federation.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome to the show.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA WHITNEY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.525 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell
us first how you

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
were involved with the
Pleiadians and the Orions.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, it started
a couple of different times.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Once was in 2009 when
they introduced me

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to the concept of the
Omicron Commonwealth,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
uniting Earth together
and hopefully getting us

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
into the United
Galactic Federation.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot of time trying
to understand where they're

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
going with this, and so they've
shown me quite a bit of what

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:90%
our future looks like.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much a real thing
that we need to come together

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:84%
as a people and that we need
to understand that we're

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
part of a greater cosmic
community and stop being unto

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and realize that we
are part of something bigger.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:90%
I see them often.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:10%
Not only do I have a contact
that gives me downloads all

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:10%
the time, but I
also have a group

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:10%
that we've worked with that
has two platings in it that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:10%
are scientists.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I've gotten to see
them from different aspects

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They do all belong to the
United Galactic Federation.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They are very much the governing
authority for approximately

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:90%
3,000 planets.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.437 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a very
large community.

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a vast
system, the Pleiades.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.307 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: It's so vast.

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you
refer to Pleiadians,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about this 3,000--

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, 3,000
planets across many different

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:90%
constellations.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot of
different beings.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask them,
Can you give me a list?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%
we would be here all day.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But Pleiadians happen to be
one of the core groups that

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:90%
are in there.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
There are also Orions.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:90%
They're a core group.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.923 align:middle line:84%
There are some from Sirius
that are a core group.

00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's some
of the Andromedans

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that are a core
group, which means

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that they hold all of the
leading council positions.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.453 align:middle line:84%
They have a long
history of doing this.

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that all
of them or just the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians that refer
to themselves this way?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, so it is
across the four groups that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:90%
are part of the council itself.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:90%
So they have a large council.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
is that there are

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
24 members from those four
groups that sit on this council.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that belongs to
the United Galactic Federation

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
has a seat with which they can
participate in what is going on.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much a public
voice for all of them.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But the council pretty
much maintains the decorum

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:90%
for what is happening.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I asked them-- we
have people come in,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.032 align:middle line:90%
and the shouting begins.

00:03:22.032 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no,
that would never

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
happen, that everything
is well maintained,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that they treat
each other civilly

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:90%
and respect the opinion of all.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to them about,
are they the lawmakers?

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Because here, that's how
our system is set up.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we
don't really consider it law.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We live by the 42
universal laws.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So what comes out of
that are guidances.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what they try
to do is represent

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.815 align:middle line:90%
the guidances of the many.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
that they would

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.380 align:middle line:84%
have to come together
and agree that it would

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.898 align:middle line:90%
be of benefit to everyone.

00:03:56.898 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell us some more
about the Pleiadians' traits

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and also their
physical appearance.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
What did they look like?

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: So very tall.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Probably, 9 foot is average.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:10%
I did meet-- at one
point, when Zendor

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:10%
had to go and have his body
renewed, because the gravity is

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:10%
so hard on them, they sent a
replacement to take his place.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:90%
He was taller than Zendor was--

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:90%
9 and 1/2, maybe 10 foot tall.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So there is a different sizing
there, and they have said that.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:90%
They go--

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.523 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Their skin color?

00:04:29.523 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Their
skin color varies.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a blue
skin color to them.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Some have a little
bit of a violet tone.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:10%
Some of them have a little
bit of a greenish tone to it.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
They say that their
different hair colors,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
depending on the region
that they come from,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and their exposure to their
environment, which I thought

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:84%
was interesting because we don't
get our hair color that way.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much all have
the same facial features.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
different lineages--

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Liran, Melchizedek,
and just a lot

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
of different lineages from
wars that have come in.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
If you are what they consider
to be a true Pleiadian,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
meaning that that was
the original inhabitant

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
at the time when the
mass migration occurred,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
then you sat differently.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So there is somewhat of
a caste system there.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And they do fill their
positions by needs.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
here, we would say

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:90%
we're running out of engineers.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
We need to send people to
college to become engineers.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:84%
What they do is they plan
out that perfect environment

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and then fill it
according to that.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So their positions are very
much desired by different groups

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
because that has meaning
to their caste system.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But they do treat
each other the same.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's no
money that gets exchanged.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So it is that you take joy
in the position that you have

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
because they consider
all of them important.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So these two were
raised as scientists.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I asked them if they were
birthed, right, like we were.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And
they don't do that.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So they have a pod system
in which the body is grown,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.517 align:middle line:84%
and then a consciousness
is placed into it.

00:06:17.517 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is their lifespan?

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: 1,500
years is a lifespan.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they look at that as
being because they require

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
knowledge to be the
foundation of everything

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:90%
that they're seeking.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So those that are older, of
course, have more knowledge.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
That consciousness
then gets passed down

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to when the body finally
needs to be replaced.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does the body get
replaced throughout that 1,500

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.470 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.342 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:06:43.342 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what's the
deciding factor saying,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm done at 1,500, I don't
want to keep exchanging

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness for
another new body?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So it's a
personal thing for them.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.613 align:middle line:84%
They do believe in
ascension, but they

00:06:55.613 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
believe that that
ascension should

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
be over a very
long period of time

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because you haven't
gained enough knowledge.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that was
an interesting fact.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That is interesting.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:84%
What they told me
is that usually,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:84%
1,500 years at the end of that
is a good time to begin a new

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they're looking at
cellular age rather than age

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:90%
the way we look at it.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is they look
at, is the cell still viable,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
or do they need to
replace that body?

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll go through a
series throughout their 1,500

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:90%
years to get that body replaced.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
get to the end,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.927 align:middle line:84%
they get to make the choice of
whether they wish to ascend.

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And what they believe
when they're ascending

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
is that they're going into
their spiritual body then

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
and that that goes on.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So whether they replace it
with a physical body or not

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.287 align:middle line:90%
becomes their choice at the end.

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about family
life for the Pleiadians

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:90%
like we know it here on Earth?

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So they don't consider
themselves families.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
They consider themselves
akin to what a tribe is.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
They all come together.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:90%
They share the same lineage.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:90%
So they're very large volumes.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And we've always said things
like it takes a community

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to raise a child.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
That is literally
how they operate.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a vested interest
in the well-being of each other.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And so if they do
have a younger member,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.409 align:middle line:84%
then everybody has
a responsibility

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
to bring that younger
member along and make sure

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
that they get the wisdom
and knowledge that they're

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:90%
supposed to have.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
I have five children and,
of course, a husband.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And, well, for
most people, that's

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
a fairly large family, right?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But they consider that
so small because there's

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:84%
thousands of them that come
together as this tribe.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And you ask the
normal questions--

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
what's a routine for
you and your family?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You wonder, do they
go on vacation?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Do their children go
to school, so to speak?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they informed us
that if they need an engineer,

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:90%
they take them in.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:11.695 align:middle line:90%
They just--

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Just
download it, right?

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.955 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Download it, right.

00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It seems more of a
group collective tribal type

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And so "family" is not
a word that they use.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And I forget the
word that they said

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
because it would have been
in their native tongue,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:90%
but it's akin to a tribe.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
They also tell us that while
we call them Pleiadians,

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
they do not call
themselves Pleiadians.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have very firm names
for the different categories

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:90%
of who they are.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Different sectors
for where they're from.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:10%
So Zendor and Ilialia were
both what they call Uronian,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.650 align:middle line:10%
and then there's another
word for another group

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:10%
and so on and so forth.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.445 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way in which
they distinguish themselves.

00:09:58.445 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's kind of
interesting because we would

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
say, for Native American tribes,
this is the Dakota or whatever.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very much
representative of that.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How about
entertainment in the arts?

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they believe
that art is time and creation.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
important to them.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
You were given the
gift of being created.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, that needs to
be expressed in some way.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So art becomes very
important to them.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
because music is a harmonic--

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and what's interesting is
if you say their name--

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying Zendor, but really,
if you hear it, it's a harmonic.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like Sanskrit.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And so music becomes
very important to them.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:90%
And so it's an expression--

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
we use music for expression
too, and we use it

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:90%
for emotional expression.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:58.128 align:middle line:84%
But they use music as a form of
conveying knowledge and language

00:10:58.128 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and different things like that.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
when they talk about music,

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.792 align:middle line:84%
and it's very different
than what we know.

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you hear them
talk, is it very melodic?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes, very much so.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
When I first heard
them telepathically,

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to get into
the rhythm of it

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not used to
talking to people like that.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to listen
in your head differently.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:84%
You see the images,
and you hear the voice,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.788 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very melodic
voice that's happening.

00:11:31.788 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's a difference
between whether it

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
was from the Pleiadian
or whether it was Orion.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
While they both
do the same thing,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
it is a different cadence to
the way in which they present it

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
their emotions

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
compared to the way we
live with our emotions?

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they're
spiritual, and they

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
believed that part
of being spiritual

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:90%
is to be centered and balanced.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So they don't convey a
lot of emotions that way.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They feel that, like I say, a
heart-centric-type unconditional

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:90%
love to you.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel that
rather than an expression.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So they don't convey
a lot of emotion.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
The only time I saw emotion was
out of the Orion when he got

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
hit in the eye and suddenly
realized that that was pain.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I
never really saw emotion.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I did see a couple
of times where

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:84%
between Zendor and Ilialia,
they're very close.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.020 align:middle line:90%
She is a liaison officer.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:90%
He's a commander.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:10%
And they gave each other this
energy exchange between the two

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:10%
of them, and it looked like it
came from forehead to forehead.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So you visualized that.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: I could see it.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You could see it.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Can everyone see it?

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I think if most
people are into energy work,

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:90%
they can't.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I think if you've never
experienced that, then you're

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:90%
going to miss it.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But I saw this very definite
exchange between them.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I noted
from that exchange

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
is that that confidence
between the two of them

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:84%
in the way in which they
were working and everything.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought that
was very interesting.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
We would say, is it akin to a
pat on the back, job well done?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:90%
No, it was more than that.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So something that I hope to
be able to experience someday.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that also a part
of their fourth density,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
fourth dimension?

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You talked earlier
about the light.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
You saw the light
in some of them.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The violet ray.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Is this also-- are they
going back to 3D and 4D, 5D?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they
are capable of going

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional,
and they do it.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at this
before, and I've

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
said what I have to
think about this.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, get my frequency
to where it needed to be.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It's so natural to
them that they don't.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't skip a
beat, so to speak.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
They just go from
one to the next.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I've seen them do
that, and it's fascinating.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.928 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to
it because don't

00:14:03.928 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
we all want to go to the
fifth-dimensional state?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:06.803 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:14:06.803 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, we can do that.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we just need to have
more understanding of it.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how developed are
they in relation to space travel

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:90%
compared to all the other races?

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they
say they've been doing it

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.925 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years.

00:14:20.925 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I did not see any
question that developed

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
in any thought process of
where they were going in space.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like it's
second nature to them.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They did get to the point where
they started defining things

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
for us, so they would use
the word "interstellar"

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
versus "interplanetary" so
that we got an idea about

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
the conditions that
they deal with.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:90%
But, no, there's a funny--

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
the song, "I've
Been Everywhere"--

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and every once in a while,
when we'll ask them a question,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:84%
they'll hum that song so that
we get the indication that

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
there's probably not
too much they've seen.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I did ask them at one
point if they'd ever

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
been to the edge of
our known universe.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there's a
lot of nothing out there.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.918 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's many
ways you could take that.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly, exactly.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:84%
They have been to some
very interesting places.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:84%
They say that that's part of--
that knowledge gathering is

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
to get to other species.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They've seen lots
of different ways

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:90%
in which things can be done.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
They still come back to the fact
that the way to lead forward

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
is for everybody
to be spiritual.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.135 align:middle line:84%
They do talk about Draconians
and Reptoid species.

00:15:48.135 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In a positive
way or negative?

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, it depends
on the species there again.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I've heard them make
reference to some of the Greys

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
that are malevolent and some of
the Greys that are benevolent.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just like here.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:90%
We have the same thing.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The same with
Reptoids-- some Reptoids

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
seem to have evolved
past warlike tendencies

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
and have become more spiritual.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They don't hold that same
truth for Draconians.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
that's a warring species

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and will always be
a warring species.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So they try to avoid
them as much as possible.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
United Galactic Federation,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:84%
because they're a
non-interventionist, that's

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
their take on it,
is that we wouldn't

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
go out and seek them and try
to change them or anything.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll just let them
do their thing.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
behavioral traits can you

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.580 align:middle line:90%
tell us about the Pleiadians?

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they're pretty
mild-mannered most of the time.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I sit there
and I ask a question,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be very thoughtful
before they give an answer.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
was interesting.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why we have
that pause in between,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
whether there's a
reflection that goes on,

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
or there may be something
going on between them, how

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:90%
do I answer this or whatever.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be very
relaxed at every situation

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.483 align:middle line:90%
that they're in.

00:17:11.483 --> 00:17:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to get
alarmed about anything.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Laid back, OK.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:84%
If there's a crisis, they
just do what needs to be done.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any anxieties,
or I didn't notice any fears.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they
have that under control.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But like I say,
they also understand

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.775 align:middle line:84%
about being centered and
balanced in the energies.

00:17:33.775 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
considered some

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
of the most human-looking
extraterrestrials out there?

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I think
probably based

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:84%
on what they've told us,
that other than Cassiopeians,

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:90%
they are probably the next.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
They have said to us,
we're your Nordic version,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I think very much the
classic human being.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they say that the
Cassiopeians are probably

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:84%
first in line for being
the classic human being.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how much more
are they different than us?

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, taller,
better physiques.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anything
like overweight problems.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:90%
They don't have disease.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it stuns them that
we allow that to happen.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, we're
not really allowing it.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
pharmaceutical companies.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand why
we eat the way we eat.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's an interesting
process to learn.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not in the
best shape I should be.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm like the average American.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:90%
I like good food.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've heard
the same comments.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:90%
We're poisoning ourselves.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:90%
We're self-sabotaging.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why eat this food?

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an
interesting take on how

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.241 align:middle line:90%
they view their own physiques.

00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I asked them-- I
said, do you exercise?

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Because here, that's one of our
main conventions is exercising.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, no,
we take care of this body,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, it
takes care of us.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.395 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, wow.

00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And did they have
ways to take care of it?

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Do they have--

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
they have these--

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --relaxing places
to go to, or I don't know--

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:90%
you said they did breathwork.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
They do a lot of
breathwork, right.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was an
interesting thing that I

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
noticed when I was
talking with them before

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that they do this breathwork.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's a way of
renewing energies within them

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:90%
or exactly what it conveys.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about
too much of that.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
They just act like that's
the way it happens.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Entertainment-wise,
they do have hobbies.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So Zendor, because he's
into being a revelationist,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:84%
seeking knowledge, all
of his hobbies are--

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:90%
he reads a lot of ancient texts.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
He enjoys-- I found
this interesting.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They watch our History
Channel and then laugh

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
because they say
that's not our history.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.526 align:middle line:10%
And so then I say, well, then
tell us what our history is.

00:20:08.526 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:10%
Ilialia, she's their
liaison officer.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:10%
She is also a scientist.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:10%
She wanted to hike
anyplace she could hike.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't get enough of that.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's the thing
that she enjoys.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell us about
the Pleiadians' intervention

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:90%
with human evolution.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Did it have anything
to do with us?

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they say they've
been here many, many times.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
They talk about when we used
to have three spaceports here.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
They talk about-- what
we call Stonehenge,

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
they call those
transport portals.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
the fact that there

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:84%
used to be huge
civilizations here,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
that we had major trading
posts in and out of here.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
The Earth was a weigh station
between other constellations.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
When they had the Great
Migration because of Lyran wars,

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Earth was a stopover place.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So there was many, many
different types of species here

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, they left
from here to go someplace else.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So they look at a lot of
our history in that way.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things is we have--

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:90%
what is it-- Gobekli Tepe.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.563 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, that
used to be a spaceport.

00:21:22.563 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's interesting.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I would not have gone there.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But they say to us, well,
look at what you do.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:90%
And we do.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Our airports have carvings
representative of the area.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have these tall
ceilings to represent space

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.027 align:middle line:90%
and all these other things.

00:21:42.027 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said that's
exactly what that

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:84%
was, that they're
just uncovering

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:90%
the lobby to a great spaceport.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And so then the question
begs, what happened?

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we had
a great war that came here.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And so weapons were used that
destroyed whole territories.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And so here we are.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But they say there was
another one near Nazca.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that we're finding lots

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:90%
of different mummies there now.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Does that account
for different species

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that came in and out of there?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And then apparently, there
was one somewhere in Japan.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three
that they made mention of.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So they've been
here lots of times.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They said they used to come
in and out of here frequently.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.132 align:middle line:84%
Now they only come here
for specific things.

00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know how long
ago we're talking about here?

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I don't know how
to put a number on that.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I talk to them-- so
remember, when we look at years,

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:84%
they think of years differently
than we think of years.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
So they'll tell me 40,000 years.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But is that 40,000 years
based on a cycle of 365 days,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:84%
or is that 40,000 years based
on their cycle of chronological

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:90%
age?

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure exactly
how long that really is.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So they tell us that
the original Egyptians

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:90%
were what they call Sirugians--

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:90%
came from Sirius.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they say their history
is somewhere around 45,000

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:90%
to 55,000 years.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So they say long before
that ever happened.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, well,
what does that mean?

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, we're
talking 250,000 years.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to say, when
somebody says 40,000 years,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.412 align:middle line:84%
that frame of reference
is somewhat skewed.

00:23:30.412 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did the
Pleiadians have anything

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to do with tinkering with
human DNA here on Earth?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They have said
that's all the Anunnaki.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't really seem to
be their forte, even though they

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of scientists.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't sound like
from all the conversations

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I've had with them that they're
manipulating DNA in that way.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
They say that's a
lot of the Greys.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
cattle mutilations

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
are because they need the bovine
serum to manipulate the DNA.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they say that
that is certain Grey

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:90%
species that are doing that.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It's also certain
Reptoid species.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But they say most of
the manipulation that

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.057 align:middle line:84%
occurred on this planet was
because of the Anunnaki.

00:24:15.057 --> 00:24:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.380 align:middle line:84%
What was the most
outstanding quality

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
that you were impressed
with by the Pleiadians?

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I think
probably we're

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
going to go back to the fact
that their willingness to learn

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:90%
something new.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:84%
When you have an
intelligent species come in,

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and we can't get to the same
level that they can get to,

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was interesting
that they were willing to learn

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:90%
from us as well.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.858 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That says a lot.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: It does.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt they
were genuine with us.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt like you can
feel the unconditional love

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:90%
coming from them.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And when they speak
to you, there's

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.210 align:middle line:84%
very much this
conveyance that, we

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.260 align:middle line:84%
realize you're
part of something,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:90%
not that you're different.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's the big
thing is that it really gave me

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
comfort to know that they
consider us worth being

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.035 align:middle line:90%
part of the bigger picture.

00:25:19.035 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That shows
they want to help--

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.727 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --and
that's a big thing.

00:25:22.727 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So I felt very good about the
interface that we had with them.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think there
are any Pleiadians walking

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:90%
amongst us?

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how many?

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
they're definitely here.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.640 align:middle line:84%
They have said to us there
are many conclaves here doing

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%
studies.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
they are here.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
There are also some here
in different capacities

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:90%
other than the conclaves.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask them how many,
they'll shrug their shoulders

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, less than
5,000 and more than two.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere in that
avenue, they're amongst us.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Would we notice that?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.600 align:middle line:84%
They're not out there saying,
hey, we're here to help you.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
a very real thing.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
were fortunate for them

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to come and ask us to help them
and certainly wouldn't trade

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.370 align:middle line:90%
that experience for anything.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There must
be a tremendous amount

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.080 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence coming out
of the Orion Star system.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us a little bit
about them and more of that?

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:10%
So in the conclave that
we were dealing with,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:10%
there were two from Orion,
so Althan and Revayh.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.610 align:middle line:10%
Althan went by the
Earth name Bob,

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:10%
and Revayh went by the Earth
name Reverend, which I found

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:10%
interesting that he chose that.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:10%
Highly intelligent.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is they don't
usually have a sense of humor,

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:84%
but one of them was
trying it on for size.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And so every day, he
would give me a new joke.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it made sense.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it didn't.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a learning
process for them as well.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very tall beings.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:10%
Average height is 9 to 11 feet.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:10%
They're extremely thin if we
measured their body sizes.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And the waist was 19 inches.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:90%
That's a tiny waist.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:90%
We measured their arms.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Very long arms.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, their
fingertips fall well below where

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:90%
their knee joint--

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Then how
many do they have?

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they have
five fingers, five toes.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Very long toes.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Probably the longest toes
I've ever seen in my life.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Twice the size of one
of my fingers in length.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.060 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.268 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they wear clothes
too and spacesuits or--

00:27:42.268 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They wear a uniform,
and it's like a second skin.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Very form-fitting,
environmentally controlled.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They do have a lot of
problems with temperature,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
so the suit is a way of
controlling their temperature.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It actually covers
their head as well so

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that their head is in the
controlled environment as well.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It comes down and even
covers their hands.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So that tells you that they do
have problems with temperature.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The suit is capable as
a nanotechnology again.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So if they need to change
it, it would automatically

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.163 align:middle line:90%
change for them.

00:28:24.163 --> 00:28:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the
color of their suit?

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So it
represents the Orion.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing
that they can hold on to.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So it would go from a green
to a silver to a yellow

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
color, a chromatic look to
it, a shimmer-type look.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's customarily
what we saw them in.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But it did have the same
patches or insignias on it,

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.480 align:middle line:84%
showing that they were part of
the United Galactic Federation

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and showing that they were a
part of the planetary federation

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.950 align:middle line:84%
portion of it, meaning they
belong to the science conclave.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So let's talk about
the shape of their face,

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:90%
their head, their eyes.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: OK.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Long faces.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Very sharp jaws,
very high cheekbones.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They have a very pronounced,
pointed ear on them.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
lobe whatsoever.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The coloring was
a very blue color.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And we did have Arcturians.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at shades
of blues amongst the species.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:10%
So Pleiadians being the
lightest shade of blue,

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:10%
Orions being a
middle shade of blue,

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.770 align:middle line:10%
and then Arcturians
being a very dark blue.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And they say that that
has to do with the fact

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that they have copper-based
blood and the environment

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:90%
that they live in.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:84%
As far as the Orions go,
they have sunken eye sockets,

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:90%
which I found was interesting.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Very round.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They do say that they can
see much further than we're

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:90%
capable of seeing.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Their hearing is phenomenal.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't whisper a mile
away because I'm

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.110 align:middle line:90%
pretty sure they can hear that.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:84%
We did do some measurements
on each of them for that.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of them wear a
lens that comes down

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:84%
over the eye that
gives them sensor data,

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
allowing them to see and
interpret at a different level.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You said their eyes are
round and inset into the skull.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:90%
What color are their eyes?

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they have
very blue-violet eyes.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're just--

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to stare
at them over and over

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:84%
again because I caught
myself doing that.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful eyes.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
And I could see them--

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.440 align:middle line:84%
when they're looking
at something,

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're evaluating it, you
can see changes in the color

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.190 align:middle line:90%
happen in their eyes.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was interesting

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:90%
because our eyes don't do that.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:84%
We might adapt to light,
but theirs are clearly

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:03.740 align:middle line:84%
part of the sensory perception
of what they're seeing.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
the Orions known for?

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, a
lot of technology.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:90%
They excel at technology.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But they also excel
in, I guess, what

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.690 align:middle line:84%
we want to call it as a
variety of different areas.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.320 align:middle line:90%
They look at spirituality.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They want to learn
about other cultures.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So they apply all of
that as a central theme.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.030 align:middle line:84%
There again, it's
about knowledge.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And they share
willingly if they can.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that the
United Galactic Federation has

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.830 align:middle line:84%
told them is that they
cannot give us technology.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
going to just say,

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:84%
look at this great piece I
have, and it's just for you.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.470 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen at all.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I wish, but that's
not the way it works.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They have trades that they kept
referring to them as trades.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So they have people that
have specific skills,

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and those get traded for other
services or what have you.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the bulk
of business on that end.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.340 align:middle line:90%
They're very clever.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:84%
They negotiate,
which is interesting.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:84%
We had several instances where
they were negotiating with us.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And my--

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were
they negotiating?

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, my take is,
why don't you just ask me?

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:90%
But they don't do that.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.120 align:middle line:90%
They negotiate for it.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think that has something to
do with the way in which they've

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.790 align:middle line:84%
learned to conduct themselves
with other species is

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:84%
you negotiate for whatever
service or what have you.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:90%
But I just told them--

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, just ask, and
we're happy to provide.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how advanced
is their technology?

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I would say they're
millions of years ahead.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:44.800 align:middle line:84%
We can't even-- I
mean, when you can

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.840 align:middle line:84%
make something appear out of
nothing, that's pretty advanced.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:84%
They never had to
go find anything.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They would just say, this is
what I need, and there it is.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how has
that high technology

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:84%
influenced what they
do with other races

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.642 align:middle line:90%
and other civilizations?

00:33:03.642 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
what's interesting

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:84%
is if you belong to the
Galactic Federation,

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:84%
they've made it you're
part of that system,

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and, therefore, you can do that.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.515 align:middle line:84%
If you're outside
of it, no can do.

00:33:14.515 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what
about the relationship

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
between the Pleiadians,
Orions, and us?

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So
Pleiadians, Orions both

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:84%
belong to United
Galactic Federation,

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
so they're used to being
cooperative with each other

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.290 align:middle line:90%
and working together.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:90%
We're a new aspect in that.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
They've waited for
us to get to a point

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:38.310 align:middle line:84%
where we started waking up
and could begin to understand.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So now we're on
the edge of that.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they're hoping is that
we will cross that precipice

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and that we can
become part of them.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, I hope
that we get there.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all I see is
it's a benefit to us.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In a more
open context scenario,

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.170 align:middle line:84%
who will humans
resonate with more?

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.995 align:middle line:84%
Will it be the Orions
or the Pleiadians?

00:34:00.995 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: It'll
probably be Pleiadians

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.750 align:middle line:84%
because they're closer to
the way in which we look.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of belief
systems we have to overcome.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you see something
that doesn't look like you,

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.870 align:middle line:84%
you tend to be reserved
in moving forward with it.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
probably the Pleiadians.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And really, when they
present themselves,

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.719 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians will come
and do a more one-on-one,

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:26.000 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Orions
do not do that.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think that really,
if we're to move forward,

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:84%
it has to be in that
avenue with the Pleiadians.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Between the
Pleiadians and the Orions,

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.594 align:middle line:84%
what's your personal
takeaway from both of those?

00:34:36.594 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, of course,
they're all individuals

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:42.460 align:middle line:84%
just like we are, and they all
had something to contribute.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:10%
I enjoyed being with
Ilialia, Pleiadian,

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:10%
because she had
such compassionate

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:10%
way in which she viewed things.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't looking
to fault anybody.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's in a
homeless community.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.300 align:middle line:90%
She's emerged herself in that.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
every prejudice and bias

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and drug and so on, all
the worst that humanity

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
can dredge up, the fighting
that happens amongst them.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And so she had such
compassion for all of that

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and was willing to
immerse herself in that

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and try to teach them to have
compassion for each other.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So I really admired
her for that.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.800 align:middle line:84%
They each had something
to contribute.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And this was an
experience for them

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:90%
as well to be immersed in that.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And what were they going
to take away from it?

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.692 align:middle line:84%
And I think after talking
to them and everything--

00:35:38.692 --> 00:35:41.150 align:middle line:84%
because that's what we did is
I wrote a full report on what

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
we learned from them
and what they took away.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
is that they

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:84%
found that they had,
over the different eons,

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
preconceived notions
about our development.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing they took away
is that we are able to adapt.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
fascinating because they

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.390 align:middle line:84%
thought we had bred
that out of ourselves

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.100 align:middle line:84%
by not being able to
adapt and be flexible.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they really took that
away as a positive moment for us

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:90%
and that we can learn from that.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's a
great start for us

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to be recognized for that.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I agree
with you as well.
