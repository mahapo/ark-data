me was an extraterrestrial being

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that showed up in
my living room.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:84%
We want you now to awaken
the starseeds of this planet.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.797 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH GOLEMBESKE: Wow,
so this was the beginning

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:90%
of an awakening for you.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes, and so I
could no longer ignore it.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians can
manipulate the soul energy

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%

other planets, including mine,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:90%
as Sébastien Martin today.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.903 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: At the same time?

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: At the same time.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
By interacting with us
and what I'm doing today

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and what we are discussing
today is also part of this, too.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's about raising
awareness, but also

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
raising one's consciousness.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's going to happen.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
already happening.

Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we're

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:10%
joined by Sébastien Martin,
retired multinational chairman

and covert remote viewer
for a CIA analyst.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske, MUFON field
investigator and your guest host

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Sébastien, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, thank you
so much for having me, Josh.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Of course.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I want
to say thank you

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:84%
for continuing to come
forward with this information.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
These times are so important for
whistleblowers to come forward.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Now, let's just start
with this incredible interaction

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.170 align:middle line:90%
you had with a being named Zoar.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:84%
It was profound and
transformational.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
What should we know about
that encounter in particular?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Or what's the takeaway
from encounters like that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:90%
in general for people?

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, Zoar to me was
an extraterrestrial being that

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
showed up in my living
room back in 2011.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had no previous interest
in the UFO field or ET agenda

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it kind of
took me by surprise.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what to expect.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even thinking that
he was an alien to begin with.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.369 align:middle line:84%
I was just shocked when he
showed up in my living room.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: I imagine.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And the way he
portrayed himself as a physical

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
being who was standing up
in front of me was he looked

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
humanoid enough that I wasn't
really thinking ET right away.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But of course, he had much
bigger eyes and a forced smile.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And the smile was very
unusual because you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
could see all his teeth and
he had a very fixed smile.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
That to me was
very nerve wracking

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:90%
because it was not normal.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And it was like fixed--

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:90%
fixated in that pose.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time making
me feel very uncomfortable.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.723 align:middle line:84%
And yet, telepathically
speaking, he was telling me,

00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:90%
don't worry, this is normal.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:90%
My name is Zoar.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm from the Galactic
Alliance, and none of this

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
mattered to me because
it meant nothing,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
like I had no previous
experiences about those kind

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
of words or nothing like that.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So how this being related
to other races at the time?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was not even
part of the question.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I came to learn
more about them as I basically

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
got involved in
missions and these sorts

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
of things during remote
viewing and so on.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, Zoar was pretty
much like a new encounter that

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
made me question my reality
pretty much because everything

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:90%
seems so strange.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You had an energy glow around
him, too, that was not natural.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But again, at the time, I
wasn't questioning any of this.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I was just being in the moment.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel that
my interactions with him

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
was somewhat different, that
there was a purpose to it.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't know the purpose.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:90%
But he knew that purpose.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I came to realize
is he recognized me.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.705 align:middle line:84%
He always recognized me,
but I did not recognize him.

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Interesting.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So his behavior and
what I came to learn as time

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
went by is that through hypnosis
sessions I did also to remember

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
what truly, what was the
connection with that being was

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:84%
that he was part
of my star family,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:90%
that he was my younger brother.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: As a Pleiadian, I
was like being able to see all

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
of these offworld
events involving him,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:84%
involving my star
family, involving myself.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.607 align:middle line:84%
He broke protocols
to come to my life.

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, really?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: He was not supposed
to be interacting with me.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Huh.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.725 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: That was
against the agenda.

00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
That was against
their beliefs as well.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Like, we as a soul being had to
experience my life as a human

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
being and just live my life
just having regular emotions,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
feeling all sorts of
the range of emotions

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:90%
that human beings have.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And again, why would
you think that that

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:90%
would be important to them?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
As superior beings, you
would think that they

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:90%
would know about all of this.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
But somehow it seemed like they
were completely disconnected

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:90%
from the human emotions.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:90%
They had none.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And Zoar had no
emotions towards me.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The forced smile, like the joy
or happiness that he displayed,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:90%
was just a mimic.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
It's something that he
observed but didn't feel.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: That's why he
was a little off setting.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, that's right.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:84%
But I could connect
to his energy.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I believe
that the excitement was also

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
paired with some kind of
danger because he was not

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be there.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And that messed up
a lot of things,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.547 align:middle line:90%
in my life as well as theirs.

00:05:49.547 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm talking
about my star family.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What do
you mean by that?

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
How did it affect
your star family?

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.487 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Again, The only
agenda was my purpose was

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to live my life as a human
being and only experience human

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:90%
emotions and live and die.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I'm pretty sure a lot
of that is also expected from

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:84%
other starseeds or experiencers
on this planet, too.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They may explore other avenues
because of their knowledge

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.320 align:middle line:84%
or interactions
with those beings

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
through channeling
all these things.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So that might change
their frequency

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and they may evolve
into higher dimensions,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:90%
perhaps down the line.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I wasn't in
that mode whatsoever.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I was not interested
in any of that.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.693 align:middle line:90%
I was a businessman.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I was just conducting my
business, making money.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty much completely
grounded and into the 3D

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:90%
To me, that was a shock.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And having been presented
with all this information

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
completely, like I said, changed
my reality, but also my purpose.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
my star family again

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
told me after that
first encounter

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
saying, because your
life has changed,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.908 align:middle line:84%
we want you now to awaken
the starseeds of this planet.

00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:90%
But again, there was no agenda.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:90%
There was no manual given to me.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a very huge responsibility
without the tools,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:90%
being given to me.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I had no-- so I gave it up.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I just ignored it for years.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So this was the beginning
of an awakening for you.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: A transition for you,
even from 3D to potentially 4D.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, yes.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It was such a huge awakening.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, at first it

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
didn't seem to be
that much of an issue

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
because it was
just one encounter.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it did create a
huge imbalance in my life,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:90%
but I was still--

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.260 align:middle line:84%
like I said, I was still trying
to find balance and peace

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.940 align:middle line:84%
through this and trying
to get rid of the anxiety

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:84%
that I used to have
through visions

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:90%
I had before this encounter.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I was trying
to find a level of calm

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
through running my business
and handling my employees

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and ignoring all of this.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
put it behind me.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:84%
This was not
important to me then.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying to
discard it and ignore it.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But it came back to
me in full force.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And it kept coming.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I could no
longer ignore it.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And I always tried to stay
true to myself and to others.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when I had to talk
about my experiences to friends

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and family members and
these sort of things,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
many people would be
scared to talk about this.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And I was, too.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And through this experience,
I've lost friendships

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:90%
and I've lost my marriage, too.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Oh, I'm
sorry to hear that.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yeah, just because
I was a different person then

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I became
a weirdo trying to talk about

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
aliens and UFOs and
this sort of things.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:90%
And that became unusual to them.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I just want to back
up for one second, though.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
There was something
you said that was super

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:90%
interesting and fascinating.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So these Pleiadians have
protocols to interact with us?

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
What are the protocols, and
what specifically did he break?

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So when Zoar
showed up in my living room,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
he appeared physical
to me in the 3D world,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that he was not
physical because when he

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
disappeared on me, he
disappeared in a haze.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:90%
So he vanished.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized
he was not there physically.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:90%
It was more of a hologram.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, he came to me
through a certain channel,

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
showing up to me, and
so I could see him.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I came to realize that
the Galactic Alliance, which

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:84%
he was part of had treaties in
place between various nations

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:90%
or various alien races.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And they all each have to
respect that those treaties.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
and one of them is

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to not interact with the human
race on their own experiences.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really?

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.252 align:middle line:90%
So it's like we have free will.

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: We pretty
much have free will.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's also about a
place of learning for them.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So interacting with
us will completely

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
change the way they could
learn from us as human beings.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
If we become aware
of their existence,

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
then it could completely
change the way

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
we feel emotions and the way
we interact with other people

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
What I came to realize
is that they have

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:90%
an agenda that is very timely.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:90%
So everything is timed.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And for Zor to show up to
me was not the right time.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It was not supposed
to be happening.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:90%
But for some reason, it did.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Why?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: As to why?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, why?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I don't know.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:90%
What came to me was--

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:90%
he was just happy to see me.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why exactly.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It sounded pretty
immature in a sense.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Like a kid or
teenager breaking a rule?

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.497 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Pretty much, yes.

00:10:46.497 --> 00:10:50.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he looked like
a 20, 25-year-old guy.

00:10:50.457 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, really?

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: But I knew that
he was over 10,000 years old.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Which, in
essence, is nothing for them.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: That's
still a kid for them.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, yes.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And I'm supposed
to be his older brother.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So I saw myself as a
Pleiadian on the spaceship.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I did see myself on
a slab and not dead.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
I was just simply
having this experience.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, wait.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So in this
experience, Sébastien,

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:84%
you're reporting that
you saw your Pleiadian

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:90%
self lying on a slab on a ship?

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: How does that work?

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I was as
shocked as you are.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was--

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself, I recognized
myself on this slab.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And I was breathing.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:90%
I was not dead.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I came to realize
through experiences

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
as well, not just one time--

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I had multiple
confirmations of this--

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is that the Pleiadians can
manipulate the soul energy

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to have other experiences on
other planets, including mine,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
as Sébastien Martin today.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: At the same time?

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.837 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: At the same time.

00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So that being
while in our future

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:90%
still breathe on this timeline.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So we are part of this
timeline, but in the future.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are connecting
this experience

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
with my experience
on Earth today.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So while they are in
the future, they still

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.097 align:middle line:84%
learn from that
at the same time.

00:12:15.097 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow, that's incredible.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.555 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And I don't know
exactly how that works,

00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
for example, myself as a
Pleiadian on a spaceship.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And if he wakes up and shares
the information with the star

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
family or the
Galactic Alliance, I

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:90%
do believe it works differently.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
connect to the experience

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:84%
through almost like telepathy
or the Looking Glass

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
technology or sorts,
like, almost like they can

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:90%
see what's going on visually.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So they can see and
they can relate to that.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And also, through
the use of implants.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a little confused.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So in the future, your Pleiadian
self is lying on a slab.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Are they always
lying on the slab

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
while you live this
lifetime or no,

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
he gets up, you get up
and walk around and like--

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I don't know.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I could only
see certain events.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of other
people on Earth

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that I know of that are part of
the Galactic Alliance as well,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:90%
and are connected to them.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.420 align:middle line:90%
We recognize each other.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to talk to them,
and they have full recall

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:90%
of their place in life as well.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Some of them
work for the US government.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And some of them are
hybrids and some of them are

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
basically have full knowledge
of who they are and what

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
they're supposed to be
doing for the government,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:90%
even for the SSP.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So they're high-level
ranking type officers?

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, doing the work.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: For what I
understood, I, from the future,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:84%
they do not reside in
our past or our present.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
They do come from the future,
our future, from this timeline.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I came to realize
is, while we are the ancestors

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and we are basically there to
learn and to evolve, to be them,

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
eventually, we are almost
stuck within a certain time

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:90%
loop, like between them and us.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So as they interact with
us one way or the other,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:84%
through telepathic
communications,

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:84%
through downloads,
through whatever ways

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
they can do without breaking up
the treaties and the protocols,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
then this is exactly
what's going on.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.640 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like those treaties
have been being modified,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:90%
or I would say, lately, changed.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's addressing a different
timeline on this planet

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that the Pleiadians
have to be aware

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that if they don't interact
with the humankind,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
they will mess up with the
timeline or their timeline.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is
by interacting with us

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm doing today and
what we are discussing today

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:90%
is also part of this, too.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's about raising
awareness, but also

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:90%
raising one's consciousness.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So in order to evolve
as a human species,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
we can accelerate the
process through these talks.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But for them, it also
changes their DNA.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:90%
It changes their history.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's fascinating.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
For example, if they
accelerate the process

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of learning on this planet, that
means they can evolve faster.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:90%
They can change.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And they can become
stronger or more, let's say,

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
talk about telepathy or
weaponries or whatever it is.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.700 align:middle line:84%
They will be able to have
an edge that they didn't

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:90%
have in their current timeline.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So the timeline
is always changing

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
based on the interactions
they have with us.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, Wow.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:84%
That's really,
really interesting.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've
ever heard that before.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of profound.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.635 align:middle line:84%
What I'm getting is that
humanity and the Pleiadians

00:15:54.635 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
are tied together in some
way with their evolution.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.322 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: But we're like, we're
a much younger race than them.

00:16:00.322 --> 00:16:02.678 align:middle line:90%
They're way older in the galaxy.

00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Like, how does that work?

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Why are we so important to them?

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Because we were
part of a massive genetic

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
manipulation with other races,
not just the Pleiadians.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that we had the
Anunnaki, who basically came

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, changed
the human genome,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and made us to the starting
point of who we are today.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
was the end of it.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
There were other
manipulations going on.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians became
a product of that.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are the source
of their existence.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we are
important to them.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But they are
important to us, too.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Because without them,
we would not be--

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
or we could not be who
we are today as well.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So they are interacting with us
to still make us evolve faster

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:90%
than what we should be.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, on
a cosmic side of things,

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:84%
yo have to realize that
in the cosmic realm,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:84%
other races are already evolving
as well at the same time.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:90%
So they each evolve accordingly.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep
up with the pace.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
why, one, they

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
want us to evolve faster because
of it impacts their future,

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
it impacts their
evolution, their history.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
They are aware
that they have lost

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:84%
wars in the past because of a
lack of evolutionary position

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
from other races.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.579 align:middle line:90%
But that could change.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:84%
That means we could change
their future as well.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
We are not the only experiment
in the universe that they have.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:90%
We are one of them.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So humankind is one
race on one planet.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But there are other races
that do exist on other planets

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that they interact with in
the same shape of-- same way

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:90%
as they do with us.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So the connection
that we have is

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that if you consider
the source of energy

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're all beings in the
universe or the cosmos related

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to or a part of, these beings
are pretty much the same as us.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%
They also have a soul, too.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But the way their technologies
have allowed them to do

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
is to manipulate the soul
energy and split it up,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:84%
so they can split it
up and send it off

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to other beings on other
planets to learn from them.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What do you know about
the Pleiadian's origins and how

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that interacts with
humanity's past?

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, I do believe
that the Pleiadians are from

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
the Winter Triangle within
the Pleiades star cluster.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
planets around that

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that the Pleiadians used to
colonize and moved away from.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm aware of wars between
Pleiadians and the Draco

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Reptilians, for example.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it as well.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So for me, like
all of this is part

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
of a much bigger agenda and
history that I'm fully aware of.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
But the interaction
with the humankind

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:84%
is also a survival
mode for them.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, they need us as
much as we need them.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Humanity or the human
evolution is without them

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and without other
races, too, we would not

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
be able to evolve
to the next level.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So we need that
kind of interaction,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
because there are some
other elements that

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
will occur on this planet
that will be completely

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
outside of our control.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be prepared
for those kind of events

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:90%
down the line.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Earlier you spoke about
how their evolution is tied

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to ours.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.988 align:middle line:84%
Is that where you're kind
of talking about right now?

00:19:35.988 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, that's right.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The importance of the
humanity for the Pleiadians

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:90%
is they don't exist without us.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So they have to safeguard
our planet and humanity

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:90%
for their own sake.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic
Alliance in my eyes

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
is there to oversee what's
happening on the planet.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.228 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And this is not
just about the Pleiadians.

00:20:01.228 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
It's about other races,
too, involved in this agenda

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians
have their own agenda.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
They also know that
humanity is part

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
of this evolutionary
process that

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.320 align:middle line:84%
involves other races,
including the Greys.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow, OK.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So whatever timeline
we are on and however it changes

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
over time, it
modifies their future.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And other races' futures, too.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is all part of
the Galactic Alliance.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So they are all
allowing it to happen,

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
because they're all
benefiting from it.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Ah, OK.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So now that we're talking about
evolution and transitioning,

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
what does that really
mean going from 3D to 4D?

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.903 align:middle line:84%
And what signs or symptoms
are we seeing now.

00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels like we're kind
of in that transition, at least

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
for some people.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: That's correct.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So I could just
give you an example

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:90%
of simple remote viewers.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Please.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: As a remote viewer,
I'm still within the 3D reality

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:90%
but going onto the 4D.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So basically the reason
why I'm saying that

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
is because when you interact
with the past, present,

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and future, you can
see potential realities

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:90%
for the future.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything was mixed.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I came to realize that
each event that I was seeing

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:84%
had a different signature or
frequency, because everything

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
is energy, everything is
electric or electricity

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel that and
I could connect to that.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And that became
second nature now.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Now it's like, I don't
even question it anymore,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
I just know.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.663 align:middle line:84%
So some frequencies
would be darker,

00:21:41.663 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and you'd see a timeline in the
future that wouldn't be so good.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And other ones, you
could see that we're

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
a better society in the future?

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.443 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yeah, I
wouldn't say it's darker.

00:21:49.443 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just like to us
it might sound dark,

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
but maybe for the bigger scheme
of things, in the cosmos,

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:90%
it might be a good thing.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: We're only seeing
it based on our own perspective

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:90%
as human beings.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you're just seeing
different potential outcomes.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I think the potential outcomes
that I've seen for the future,

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I do see, for
example, that people

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
will be evolving to be more
telepathic using telekinesis.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, are we prepared
to get into this realm,

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.430 align:middle line:90%
into the 4D or the 5D?

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we are as human
beings the way we are today,

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:84%
we are relying too
much on technology.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And society has been
driven or created really

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to subdue the races
and other people.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The media and everything that's
around us is embedding us

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
into these 3D reality and
don't want us to change.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Science is basically
the same thing.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They have dogmas
and protocols that

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
prevent us to move
up to the next level.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
If they were embracing
other technologies

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and even realizing that
the soul even exists,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:84%
they would be able to fast
forward science for hundreds

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:90%
of years overnight.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
They could do that today,
but they are preventing

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.935 align:middle line:90%
it to happen for a reason.

00:23:08.935 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: What's the reason?

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.643 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, the reason is
because they want us to evolve.

00:23:12.643 --> 00:23:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What other abilities or
revelations will come as people

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.507 align:middle line:90%
shift from 3D to 4D?

00:23:18.507 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
we should talk about?

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.465 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yeah, but you
have to realize something.

00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, in our society,
if we become telepathic

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
or we can use
telekinesis, can you

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:84%
imagine the repercussions
it will have on people

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:90%
who have bad intentions?

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, yeah.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So what I'm saying
to you is moving forward,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the way we think about the world
and about society will change

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:90%
drastically.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really
matter if you're a telepath

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:84%
or if you can use telekinesis
is how you should be thinking.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
The way you should
be thinking would

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
change as well, because
everything around us

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:90%
will be different.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So the monetary system
as we know it today

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:90%
will no longer exist.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So we'll shed some of
these systems as we go forward.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, exactly.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.930 align:middle line:90%
We will have to.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.465 align:middle line:84%
One doesn't exist
without the other.

00:24:05.465 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Huh, so it's less
about psychic abilities.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
It's more about how
we perceive the world

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.837 align:middle line:84%
and how we unroll all
these systems on top of us.

00:24:11.837 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Everything we change.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a matter
of gaining powers and trying

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:84%
to evolve as a human race,
it's everything around it

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.798 align:middle line:90%
will change because it has to.

00:24:21.798 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Well, I'm
looking forward to that.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think real
ascension, this process we're

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:84%
talking about, asks like of
us, and not just personally,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:90%
like collectively?

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Individually speaking,
I can tell you

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness can
change many other people's

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, too.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So your impact on the
collective consciousness

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:84%
is, to me, one as
part of a whole.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We basically everybody
do their part,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
but everybody is also subjected
to the same frequency.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we are being
subjected to one frequency,

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:90%
everybody else is as well.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But everybody reacts
differently to it.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And so some
are more attuned to it.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But everybody contributes to
the collective consciousness.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, this
consciousness, it's like--

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine this
planet as a sphere,

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
portions of it,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and then it merges like you
have different areas of energy.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And then those energies
connect to each other

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:90%
and then forms a whole sphere.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
where we're at.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So in various
parts of the world,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:84%
people are experiencing
those changes

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can see those
big pockets of energy.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it expands
and expands and expands

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to eventually connect to
other energies on this planet

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:84%
to make a total pure
sphere with no holes in it.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going to be aiming to

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:84%
for the different dimensions
or future dimensions.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be able to
navigate from 3D to 4D to 5D

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.177 align:middle line:90%
in a very seamless motion.

00:25:54.177 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's beautiful.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So the individual
affects the collective.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And the more individuals
that are vibrating or hitting

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:84%
the right frequency
makes the collective,

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.797 align:middle line:90%
pick up speed as well.

00:26:03.797 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And then more people-- it will
be easier for more people, too.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Exactly.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.293 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, very fascinating.

00:26:08.293 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So this timeline,
how we modify it is based

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:90%
on our belief systems, too.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not just what we receive
as downloads or information,

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:90%
it's what our mind can achieve.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So our belief system
is very powerful.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Not many people realize that.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine when you
feel stressed out or, for me,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:84%
when I had anxiety, it
was a state of mind.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
That has an impact
on my physical body.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.198 align:middle line:84%
Which would then
affect the collective.

00:26:39.198 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Well, exactly.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you basically
have a state of mind

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
when you believe that
the future timeline would

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:84%
be in a certain way, then that
is shared with the collective,

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.818 align:middle line:84%
And everybody will start
thinking the same way,

00:26:51.818 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:84%
like a beehive in a situation,
because we are all connected.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yes.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And that's exactly
what's going to happen.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.725 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
already happening.

00:26:59.725 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Sébastien, that
was beautifully put.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.272 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for everything
you exposed today for us.

00:27:04.272 --> 00:27:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, thank
you for having me.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
