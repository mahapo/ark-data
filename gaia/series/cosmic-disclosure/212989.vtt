00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
we are with former US
Marine Mike Herrera.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
Distinguished Service record.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:10%
Today, we discuss the pros
and cons of this effort.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.623 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE HERRERA:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to
be here as always.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So is Congress
planning to reveal the whole UAP

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And if so, who's going
to be in control of that?

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: Well, I think Congress
has taken the right step

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand that this
is a real situation and a real

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
scenario that people have
to get in their heads.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think it's
surprising to a lot

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
because obviously, there's
been the stigma which we all

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:84%
know about, people have
been ridiculed for this.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why senators,
politicians, presidents

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
have refused to even
comment on this subject

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
just because they don't want
to be associated with it.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But when you have credible
people stepping to the plate

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
to try to provide the actionable
intelligence to the Senate

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence committee, to
Senate, to members of Congress,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
it definitely begs the
question of why would anybody

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
be doing this, like,
why is everybody also

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:90%
connecting the dots?

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.178 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's
testimonies and stories

00:01:24.178 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
are connecting the dots for
them to actually understand

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
that there's a problem here.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
a lack of oversight.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, because
they keep adding additional

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
committees for this committee
now to oversee this,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to oversee that.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you think eventually
though who's going to be--

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:84%
once it is revealed,
is what I mean,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
who do you think will
be in charge of that?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: That's up in the air.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But you know as
well as I do, when

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.745 align:middle line:84%
they put boards and committees
up to stuff like this,

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
it's more of trying to
put it out to pasture.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.537 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to work
very hard to make sure

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't happen.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So if they're going to put
people who actually are not

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
going to be on these committees
to actually just sweep this

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
under the rug so
to speak, I think

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:84%
as people that actually
have to understand,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
hey, we need to go to
these installations,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
we need to know what
project names that they are,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
we need to know what
is in these projects,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.513 align:middle line:84%
where are these materials coming
from, and who above all else

00:02:13.513 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:84%
has actual oversight of
this, and why are they

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.490 align:middle line:90%
not asking those people.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And we spoke earlier
off the record

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
about not just the US
Congress, but what can you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%
tell us about other nations?

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: Well, I know the United
Kingdom is definitely wanting

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of European
Union countries as well.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
As far as Russia I'm not
really understanding if they're

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:90%
actually on board with that.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I know people in Australia
as well as their members

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
are wanting the same thing
because this isn't just

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:90%
the United States initiative.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:84%
This has to be a
global initiative.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And if governments are
contacting each other,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
corroborating the same
testimonies or even

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
people that have similar
experiences, maybe

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
similar projects
that they have that's

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
top secret from the
population knowing,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to
definitely connect

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
the dots on a global scale.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how do you
think these ET technologies,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
these assets are going to be
handled once they're surrendered

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.058 align:middle line:90%
to us?

00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: So once
they're surrendered,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
there's going to obviously be
some considerations that people

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:90%
need to understand.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
One, they do not want the
weaponization of the technology

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
to be given out too
freely to everybody else.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be who's
to say that there's

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
people going to
have good intentions

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of technology.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
People need to
understand something

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that can be used to cure you
can also be used to destroy you.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Correct.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And so getting people more self
reliant on this technology,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
so the question is, what is it
going to do with these energy

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:90%
companies per se?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
If you have a device that
you put in your house that

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
powers your house,
that controls the heat,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that can control AC for example,
or even car manufacturers.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So you look at
electric car models

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:84%
for example and
how sophisticated

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that is, who's to
say that this is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.963 align:middle line:84%
going to either over complicate
that or oversimplify it?

00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
stuff in the air.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And people aren't
thinking about the time

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take to transition
from once this is revealed

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
completely, all the way up until
the length of time it's going

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to take to actually incorporate
this and actually shift

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:90%
the world into that direction.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.904 align:middle line:84%
I estimate it probably
take within 10 to 20 years

00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
that we could see
something like that happen,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
granted if Congress and they
stick to what they intend to do.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And what agencies do you think
perhaps will be running this?

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
With these technologies,
or is it just

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.062 align:middle line:84%
going to be buried again
in the black projects?

00:04:35.062 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: There's definitely
a risk of it being buried

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because the weaponization
process we've talked about.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
As long as it has correct
oversight from people

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Senate
Intelligence committee

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.638 align:middle line:84%
that oversee the budgets,
especially the black budget,

00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
what they're going to
notice is they're not

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
be any embezzlement

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
because these corporations are
going to be put in check, which

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:90%
is what should happen.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And I think that will happen.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
to go and put this

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:90%
into research and development.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.613 align:middle line:84%
So let's say Air Force
Intelligence, if you will,

00:05:03.613 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden they
oversee the projects that

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
go towards more of a
transportation aspect with this.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Because then you take the
big C-5M Galaxy planes

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that transport, who's
to say that they

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
don't have anti-gravity
craft that can transport?

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Not using fuel,
not using anything

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:90%
like combustible engines.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.030 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be much cleaner.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.238 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be much faster.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:90%
It's much less dangerous.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is having
to train these people on

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:90%
to utilize this craft.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the other question too.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to
actually utilize that?

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to have to have--

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Outfitting all
these craft and vehicles,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:90%
not just craft.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, who's going
to do all that training,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and where does that start?

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Who's responsible
for the education?

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Right.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's going
to have to be considered

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.243 align:middle line:84%
because these people that are
running these programs they know

00:05:47.243 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
best because that's just a
typical day of work to them.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They may be well versed and
know how everything works.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Now you're having to
read people who already

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:90%
have a skeptical mind as it is.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
That may, oh, this isn't
real, this isn't genuine.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.612 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
people that deal

00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
with this on a daily
basis that are going

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.987 align:middle line:84%
to have to teach these
people like, hey,

00:06:04.987 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
this is what you have
right in front of you.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:90%
This is how it's utilized.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.555 align:middle line:84%
This is what we've been
doing for X amount of time.

00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:12.138 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's going
to be a learning

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:90%
curve for a lot of people.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's also going
to be a learning

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
curve for the people that
are involved because they're

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
going to have to now
teach and instruct people

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
how to utilize this
technology safely.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think the black
team agenda that this is part

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
of that agenda, or they're
just preparing for it maybe?

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.672 align:middle line:84%
Or is this just coming,
and they don't know?

00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: There's definitely
people within these

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
organizations that are good guys
that want this to be completely

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:90%
transparent and with oversight.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Just because of the
technological advancements

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be throughout
human history coming forward.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
We even talk about natural
disaster responses.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:90%
We talk about even medicine.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
We talk about-- you are well
versed in harmonic frequencies

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and how they can
destroy cancers.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.408 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say that
they're not going

00:06:54.408 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do the same
thing but refine it to

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
instead of having cures
that make people bankrupt

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
like the pharmaceutical
companies

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.663 align:middle line:84%
per se, now you're
going to have maybe five

00:07:04.663 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical companies get
on board with this technology

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and actually cure people
and keep curing people.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:90%
It also goes to animals.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It goes to zoology too.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you see comparing
Congress with the black team

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:90%
agenda moving forward?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they both going to
be on the same level,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
or is there still going to be
this I'm better than you thing?

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: Well, from
my understanding,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
the black organization,
as global as it is,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
there's still a small
number of the bad guys.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And so hopefully,
the good guys are

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.272 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are going to
flip the tables so to speak,

00:07:34.272 --> 00:07:36.323 align:middle line:84%
and align with the
views that Congress

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
government is going

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to have to try to get
this to be solved.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%
The disclosure process.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I think right now has been a
soft disclosure because there's

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.767 align:middle line:84%
been credible people
who have stepped up

00:07:45.767 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to the plate and
briefed Congress

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.425 align:middle line:84%
on national television of
what they know personally.

00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.933 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: So that's more
of a soft disclosure

00:07:51.933 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:90%
because there's witnesses.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
There's people who also attest
to these individuals that

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
went to Washington DC to testify
and say, yes, what they're

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
speaking or-- they're the
face of their organizations,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
or they're similar people that
may have been in their shoes.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So they're representing
a vast group of people

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:90%
that have experience with this.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
My personal view is
that I don't think

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
the bad guys are necessarily
going to freely want

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:90%
to give up this stuff.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.008 align:middle line:84%
It's making them a
boatload of money.

00:08:18.008 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I can see that.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: They have the grip
on humanity so to speak.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:90%
They don't ride within the laws.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
They completely go
against the law.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Everything they do is illegal.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:90%
It's unconstitutional.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It's very heinous crimes that
they commit on a daily basis.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you suggesting
that perhaps there may be

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:84%
an internal war, a
pushback from the few dark,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
dark people that are in
the black organization,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:84%
or are the white hats going
to be able to take over that?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: Well, hopefully
speaking that they do.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:84%
At least get the bad
people put in check,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or get them to realize
what they're doing is bad,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's wrong.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, but you're drunk
with power and greed.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And with all the
things that they have,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:90%
that's easy access to them.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So I would hope that
that's what happens.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:90%
But it's up in the air.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I have no knowledge
of that personally.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's possible.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We can only
just hope for the best.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Correct.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what we should
do is hope for the best

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:90%
and maybe that'll play out.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what are the pros
and cons of revealing this

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:84%
amazing new technology that
the black programmers have been

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:90%
hiding?

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: Well, we'll
start with the pros.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
The pros are obviously going
to be medical sciences.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.903 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
advancements with that.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Transportation, you're going
to have stuff that's actually

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:90%
going to help the ecosystem.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.933 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have
to worry about pollution.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
poverty pretty much cured

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.623 align:middle line:84%
within a few
generations of people

00:09:39.623 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
will be able to afford

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
these relatively easily,
especially because you're

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
going in third world countries.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And with this
being said, I think

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:84%
when it becomes common knowledge
of where this technology has

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
been developed from, people are
going to have more awareness

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and have more of an open mind.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So who's to say that this
leads us down the road

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
to actually start having
groups where they can actually

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
have official contact groups
based off of peaceful measures

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
intelligence,

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they're going
to give us at some point

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
also another
technological exchange.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe getting us to a different
point in civilization where we

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:90%
can start being interstellar.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.872 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And who do you think
is going to allocate that like

00:10:19.872 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:84%
for medical or
even construction.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Anti-gravity would be great
to move things around.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Exactly.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.437 align:middle line:84%
You're not having to
worry about popping tires

00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:29.342 align:middle line:84%
on the highway from
potholes, right?

00:10:29.342 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, but at
the same time it's

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.092 align:middle line:90%
going to keep everything clean.

00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:35.538 align:middle line:84%
So it's up in the air who
would actually oversee that.

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be
a lot of trial and error

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:90%
before it gets refined.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
a lot of headache

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
for some that are involved
because you're having

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:90%
to transition this technology.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think that could also be
listed as a cons in that aspect.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Either way.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: You know, and the cons
obviously would be this not

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:84%
being implemented in a sense
that it's going to be killing

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.695 align:middle line:90%
each other over resources again.

00:10:56.695 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But you're using more
advanced technology to do it.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.153 align:middle line:90%
That's what's already been done.

00:11:00.153 --> 00:11:01.587 align:middle line:90%
It's being done presently.

00:11:01.587 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that needs to stop.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think this is
also not just going to happen

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
here in North America, but
it'll benefit globally?

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: I believe it
will benefit globally.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.185 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
be launched the same way

00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to have
people talking to each other

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.143 align:middle line:84%
throughout different
countries and how

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:90%
they're going to utilize this.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.242 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's going to be--

00:11:21.242 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The logistics on
this is just overwhelming.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.283 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Yes, it is.

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
don't think about,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.525 align:middle line:84%
is logistics or
what would happen

00:11:27.525 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
because the first thing that's
going to come to your mind

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:90%
is careful what you wish for.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be revealing
to some people that

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
may be super religious that--

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:84%
but then, again, if you're
looking into textbooks back then

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands
of years ago,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:84%
they all talk about
the same thing.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Correct.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.328 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: You know, so I think
getting people to understand

00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
them have more of an open mind
I think is going to suit more.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that's going to be
the biggest pro in history

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
is getting people to
have be open minded

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and understand that we're
not the only ones here

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.817 align:middle line:84%
in this universe that
are calling the shots.

00:12:00.817 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, that leads
me to my next question.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Is there an extraterrestrial
role in the transition?

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: If it's a peaceful
measure and let's say that

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
everybody put their
weapons down per se,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:84%
nobody is being targeted,
shot down another sky,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that's very
possible that could happen

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
because who's going to say that
this technology gets utilized

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
in a sense that's going
to up our consciousness?

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to up
somebody's consciousness,

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make
them happy, if you're

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
feeling good all
the time and happy,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
want to go next door

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and go blow up your neighbors.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: You're
going to feel good.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:90%
They're going to feel good.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.775 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going to be on
the same page with that.

00:12:32.775 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you believe this is
being initiated by the humans,

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.435 align:middle line:84%
or possibly it's being initiated
by the extraterrestrials?

00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: I think
right now it's humans.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
is because obviously

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:84%
how delicate everything
is right now.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we get
to a certain point,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
then there may be
extraterrestrial intervention

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that can help us steer
into the right direction,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even teach
us how to utilize

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.768 align:middle line:90%
this technology correctly.

00:12:55.768 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think they're
kind of waiting for us to step

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:90%
it up?

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: I believe so.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.112 align:middle line:84%
Because here's-- you know as
well as I do with how long this

00:13:03.112 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
has been going on, there would
have been a point where they

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
could have intervened and
done that at any point.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But they're not going
to be here to give us--

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They're not
handing out freebies.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: Yeah, they're not
going to give us a fish.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.442 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
teach us how to fish

00:13:13.442 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
because that's going to teach
us to grow as a civilization.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I agree.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of
any other nations

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.148 align:middle line:84%
that are in contact with
extraterrestrials about this?

00:13:23.148 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: About the subject, no.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
there are contact groups

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
in different countries that are
trying to establish relationship

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:84%
At least contact groups
that are trying to show open

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
minded people that, yes, we're
not alone in this universe.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, so I think
more people globally

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
get on board with
that aspect, it's

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
going to show potentially
extra civilization

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrial
civilizations for that matter

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:90%
how humankind really is.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're not those
barbaric apes so

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to speak, like we actually
have a desire to learn.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:90%
We have a desire to teach.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how we become better as
people is by teaching others

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:90%
to do the right thing.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they able to
decipher though a very harmless

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
group of contactees and a black
flag group that's trying to kill

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.665 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: I think they can--

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They have
discernment I mean to--

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: I believe that they do.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they're keeping
their distance for that reason

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.297 align:middle line:84%
because one, there's
people who've

00:14:19.297 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
never done this before who
are frightened at that idea.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they stumble onto
it accidentally because that

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
does happen all the time.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of makes them
feel like, OK, there's

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
something that's more powerful
than what we understand

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
than the laws of the
universe because you

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
have beings that are able to use
those laws for their benefit.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're choosing
to use those benefits

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
in a peaceful measure as opposed
to going throughout the universe

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:90%
and conquering star systems.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So in
your opinion, Mike,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.550 align:middle line:84%
what do you think if people
would actually see a video that

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
was recently took
of black teams,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
loading up a P3 kind
of mission there,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.288 align:middle line:90%
how would their response be?

00:15:00.288 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: I think it's
going to be shocking.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.247 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's what
would happen because you're

00:15:04.247 --> 00:15:08.202 align:middle line:84%
having the revelation that
humankind is able to communicate

00:15:08.202 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: In a sense what that's
going to do is it's going

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.155 align:middle line:84%
to pave the way for open minded
people to understand that, yes,

00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
what you're maybe
stumbling onto individually

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
because there's people
who aspire to do this.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's groups
around the world of hundreds

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people that
want to be a, quote, unquote,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:90%
"ambassador" of--

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Right,
opening their minds up.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Correct.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think it has
reaffirmation on the aspect

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:90%
that this can be done.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to build
confidence for that.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Now it's almost like saying--

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
let's if somebody
wants to be a pilot

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and they see like
somebody teaching them

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
how to fly an aircraft per
se, and they see a video

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
on how all of this is done.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I never thought
I could learn this way,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.235 align:middle line:90%
but now I'm learning.

00:15:48.235 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
That's how YouTube's using a
resource to actually show people

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:90%
how things are done.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I think this could be done
in a similar fashion on how

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to actually and
correctly contact

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial civilizations
for peaceful purposes.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So once that is established,
and I think it's going to be--

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
damage people's egos

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:84%
at first, which I'm
all about ego death

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:90%
because that's how you learn.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.345 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's the rebirth.

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Yes, it is.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes you
grow as an individual,

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
it makes you grow as
a conscious level.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So after that initial
shock happens,

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:90%
then the realization happens.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Then I think when more people
take the understanding of how

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:84%
this is done and apply it
with themselves, groups

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of like minded
people, that is going

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
to have a large movement for
disclosure on its own purpose

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of
intervention between

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
military, such as
Congress, Senate,

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
anything like that
to do it that way.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:84%
People are taking
initiative to get

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
disclosure on their own
terms and the easiest

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.215 align:middle line:84%
way they can do it is possible,
which is these contact methods.

00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The pros and cons
of all this that we're talking

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
about right now is going to
affect society, humanity,

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:90%
and mankind as a whole.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what can
you enlighten us

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
of how that transition
is going to happen?

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: Well, personally I
think it's going to be rough.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.194 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at, for example,
we'll talk about the lockdown.

00:17:06.194 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: There's going
to be some, you know,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
"I don't believe this."

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Well, 100%.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's on both
aspects of this, right?

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
you try to influence

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:90%
the population in a way.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.733 align:middle line:84%
We can say like what
we've been encountering

00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple
of years that's

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:90%
been going around to people.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.447 align:middle line:84%
Misinformation
tactics with that.

00:17:25.447 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But from people you
wouldn't expect it

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.488 align:middle line:84%
from, but then all
of a sudden, you

00:17:28.488 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
have the people that have the
right information also getting

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
it from different platforms.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it might be
done in the same way

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:84%
because what people
have to understand

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.270 align:middle line:84%
is humans have an agenda
at the end of the day.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have
corporate people that

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:84%
are trying to monetize
this to be the ones that

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.538 align:middle line:84%
know about it first and try
to get their stories heard

00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:84%
before anybody else
that actually has

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.907 align:middle line:84%
firsthand knowledge
of this, I think

00:17:50.907 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
some conflict with that.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
The other issue is the
fact that you have senators

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and Congress people have
talked about the disclosures.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Political.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Yes.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So there's always a game
being played with that.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.335 align:middle line:84%
And the excuse
that they have is,

00:18:02.335 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
oh, it would have to
restructure civilization.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, there has to be a
rebirth in that sense.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Look at the collapse of
different civilizations

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But how do you
restructure religion?

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: I don't--

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.812 align:middle line:90%
I personally don't know.

00:18:16.812 --> 00:18:17.895 align:middle line:90%
But that's going to be a--

00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's going to
be one of the biggest ones.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.053 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: And I think this is
a "red pill moment," quote,

00:18:22.053 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:84%
unquote, that a lot of people
are going to have to understand.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:90%
You can talk about God.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.335 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about how God
may have created ETs too.

00:18:29.335 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just to our
understanding of what

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:84%
we personally as a human
species have encountered

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.443 align:middle line:90%
is what can we reflect.

00:18:36.443 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't know everything
in the universe

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:84%
because we've never been out
to the reaches of the universe,

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.100 align:middle line:90%
the far--

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
as far as I'm concerned,
as far as to my knowledge.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But who's to say if
humans are regularly

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:84%
traveling amongst
the star systems

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and accounting
different things that

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:84%
defy what they're
used to knowing.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
damaging to some.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.703 align:middle line:84%
But that's going to be
enlightening for most

00:18:54.703 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:90%
people that have open minded.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
about the trajectory

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.933 align:middle line:84%
that we're heading into
especially with what we're

00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
dealing with now is
there's a lot more

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
open minded people who are
not willing to take things

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:90%
at face value.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is allow
people to research

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and look into it on
their own accord,

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
to provide themselves
an understanding.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So self education
in that respect

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.495 align:middle line:84%
is going to pave a
brighter future for people,

00:19:15.495 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
instead of just having to
take people's face value.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I want people to research and
look into it because then you're

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
going to come up to
your own determination,

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.695 align:middle line:84%
whether you believe it's
false or whether you

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:90%
believe it's true.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.415 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
evidence out there.

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:84%
There's so much things
that corroborate

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.715 align:middle line:84%
other people to say, yes, what
we're talking about is true.

00:19:30.715 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
They're going to fall in
line with that because all

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.257 align:middle line:84%
the evidence are
going to be given

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:36.410 align:middle line:84%
in one with their own
individual research

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is going to paint them
into that direction.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, it
needs to be done.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a very positive way

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.140 align:middle line:84%
to look at it because most
of the people out there

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.572 align:middle line:90%
do want to know the truth.

00:19:47.572 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
talking about here.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Right.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know you're going to
have to lose what we currently

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
have in order to
better understand

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
what we can potentially
gain from this as a species.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's very powerful
stuff to understand that.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So people get stuck
in their own ways

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
problem with humans

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is that they get
stuck into repetition,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.030 align:middle line:90%
or doing the same thing.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they build
habits because they're

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with that.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
You have to get uncomfortable
with comfortable,

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
especially with this idea
to transform this race

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:90%
into a better civilization.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.513 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
just and I, there's

00:20:16.513 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
billions of people
on this planet.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.513 align:middle line:84%
There's generations
of people that are

00:20:19.513 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:90%
going to follow suit with this.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I know when I
leave this Earth, I

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:84%
want this planet to be better
off than what I found it.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And if I get to do in a sense
with what I'm doing now,

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:84%
it's going to help
out tremendously.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Speaking of the pros
and cons of ET revelations,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about when the new
Galactic way comes, all right,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
how are we going to not
only restructure that,

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:84%
but how do we fit into
that harmoniously?

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are we is there going
to be some sort of person that

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:84%
comes and represents
on their end

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
to let us know this is
how it's going to unfold,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:84%
or is it going to
be a joint thing?

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
How do we both all
integrate in a loving way?

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: So I think the first
question we have to understand

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
is hierarchy, right?

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't believe
that they have a hierarchy.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they have the
system where everybody is equal,

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.772 align:middle line:90%
and they're all the same.

00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what creates
or mitigates any way

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.562 align:middle line:84%
any kind of
differences such as why

00:21:16.562 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
we have wars to begin with
in the first place because

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:90%
of differences.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Realistically there are petty
in a lot of ways, right?

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they're
on a unified system that

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.693 align:middle line:90%
makes everybody equal.

00:21:26.693 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be
hard for a lot of people

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to understand because
it's a primitive nature

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to have hierarchy positions
because it establishes rank,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's always going
to be on top of the pyramid.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.495 align:middle line:84%
So if that's going
on, I don't think

00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
able to get to a point

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:84%
where they're at because people
want to have the natural ability

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to actually be in
charge of something

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:84%
or try to put themselves
on a pedestal that's

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:90%
different from everybody else.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:84%
We all put our pants
on the same way.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:90%
We all learn the same way.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:84%
We all experience life
in the same exact way.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe taught in
different instances.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe taught in ways
that people can actually

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:90%
understand it.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think to get to a point is
going to have to first establish

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
world peace.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.895 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has to set their
differences aside for--

00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: If you can do this in
a year where everybody can put

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.785 align:middle line:84%
their differences aside,
everybody understands that

00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:84%
we're all humans at
the end of the day,

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.373 align:middle line:84%
we all want the same things,
we all want our families to be

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
taken care of, we all
want to experience love,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:90%
we all want to experience--

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And we all have
food, water, and shelter.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.733 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Yes, we do.

00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:90%
We all want those things.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So if everybody is living
in an abundance mindset

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
with that degree,
that's going to get

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
us further understand of how
these galactic federations

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:90%
if you will operate the same.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is equal.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it needs
to be established.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of good
organizations in this world that

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
are beneficial have the
understanding that everybody

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:90%
is on the same level.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's humility at
the end of the day.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:90%
It's keeping people humble.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And if extraterrestrials
are in a sense to teach us

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
how to be more humble towards
each other and to ourselves

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
more especially, it's going
to get us onto that level

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
where we can potentially
join a system like that

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and maybe integrate
that here on Earth.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And learning
their system over this time,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:90%
seeing how they did it.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.043 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Correct.

00:23:11.043 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And
implementing that with us.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Correct.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And if they've been around
a lot longer than we have,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's going
to be very encouraging,

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:84%
because we actually have
steps to look forward to

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Granted if-- it's like playing
four dimensional chess with what

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:90%
we're doing right now.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And if we can actually
turn the tides of what

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:84%
the current direction is and
go to the better direction,

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to allow other
things to happen in the future

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that we maybe never
thought would be possible.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's opening up possibilities
for humankind to advance

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are beneficial
towards everybody

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
such as no conflicts, no
wars, better ecosystems.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You talk about better
ecosystems that

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:84%
means humans are
going to be healthier.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're healthier
and feeling good,

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be happier.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're happier,
you're going to elevate

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to a level of
consciousness that's

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
going to be very radioactive,
no pun intended in that nature.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But then you're going to be
able to be potentially invited

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
to partake in what these
other federations are doing.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, an overabundance
would maybe help us out a little

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
bit.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Correct.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And who's to say that maybe
we get the technology where

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to actually
mine for resources,

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.532 align:middle line:84%
but we can
materialize resources.

00:24:18.532 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: There you go.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE: And guess
what that means?

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Earth doesn't have to be
damaged in the process.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.588 align:middle line:84%
It means things are easier to
come by what that understanding.

00:24:25.588 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mike, I love
what you had to say.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I totally resonate with that.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for being on the show.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MIKE: Thank you, Emery.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure as always.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
