[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with retired SEAL Team

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:10%
Six Chief Petty
Officer Michael Jaco,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
who has over 35 years of
extensive combat experience,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:10%
including 11 years as
a CIA security officer.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.395 align:middle line:90%
Michael, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Emery, great to be here.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> From your Space
Force experience,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us some things
about some of the combat

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
technology that you
were exposed to?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Combat technology is one
of the greatest things that is

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:90%
happening in the Space Force.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So I had a great advanced
training in that weaponry.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of using
different technologies.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a
plasma light one.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
with knives-- so

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
knives and also
swords of plasma.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Then we went into different
technologies of weaponry.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So the weaponry I
remember as not like

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
we have today where you
have bullets, a magazine,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
with maybe 20, 30 rounds, or
if you have a drum on a machine

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:90%
gun of 100 rounds.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Weaponry and
munitions that we have

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
is in the thousands of
rounds per magazine.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you put a
magazine in some

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:84%
of these weapons, these
pulse energy weapons,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
it shoots out a pulse
energy that goes out

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and hits a target.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
the nanotechnology.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It hits it and then
starts to break it down.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So very, very
advanced technologies.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It's made so that when you
bring it up and fire it,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
it conforms to your body
or to your body armor.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we wear different
types of body armor

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that will make us bigger
or smaller or whatever,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
the weaponry actually
conforms to your body,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
knowing just the right
length it needs to be.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
to use these weapons.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.333 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned these suits
and these amazing weapons.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Did they ever have,
like-- did you have,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
like, special helmets that
are linked to the system?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The helmet systems have a
dropdown ocular little space

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
where it's all kinds
of technologies in it.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you need
as far as technology,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
whether it's night vision,
whether it's thermal,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.760 align:middle line:84%
all these different things will
operate on the ocular cavity.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
bring down the screen

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
so it is across your
whole face, as well.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.228 align:middle line:84%
>> So like a heads-up
display type thing?

00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Heads-up display that
manifests in front of you

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually
walk and still see things,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and you still have information.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's information they'll
give you, like time to target,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
distance to target, as
you're patrolling in,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:90%
or direction you need to go.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So the navigation
equipment that normally we

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
have to drop down and
look at, it's right there

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.230 align:middle line:84%
in front of your face,
and it's at a level that's

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:84%
far more advanced than
anything I've ever seen.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It is quite extraordinary.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had to have
an implant in your body

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
put in so you could
utilize the weapons

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and utilize other
things like your suits?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had implants
for different things,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and one of those was for
looking-glass technology.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Looking-glass
technology basically

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
allows you to see forward
in time on the battlescape.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually able to see how
the mission's going to turn out

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:90%
before we even go in.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, that changes as we move in.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly monitoring
that instead of me

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
having a heads-up display or
having an iPad-type device

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
that I need to look at and
see what's going on now.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting that from
the actual looking glass.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So we sometimes won't
even hit a target

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:84%
until we get a good information
from the looking glass

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:90%
technology it's time.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Explain this looking glass.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.299 align:middle line:90%
Is it a certain type of AI?

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
it's definitely

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
running an algorithm for you
to accomplish the mission.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as
the mind of God.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.982 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at
the mind of God.

00:04:30.982 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm connecting with it.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about how you have
to have advanced consciousness

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of these
different craft,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
for these weapon systems, and to
be able to operate many of them

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously and communicate
with your teams telepathically.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with the
looking glass technology.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've had an implant
that was in my shoulder that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:90%
allowed me to communicate.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So it communicated with
my brain neural link.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.117 align:middle line:90%
So we think of neural link now.

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:84%
With Tesla technology,
everybody's like, no,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to get
the neural-- like, I

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
don't know what that's like.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But I know in the
space program--

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
that is, the Space Force--

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely phenomenal.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, we've
used nanotechnologies

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:90%
which are positive.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And we also have neural
links which are positive,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
things that help us
communicate with each other,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
communicate with source, source
field energy and so forth.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
That force basically is a force
to boost through all things,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and we learn how to connect
with that in the Space Force.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>> What other weapons
can you talk about?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Other weapon systems that
I like are this one that sends

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:90%
out a pulse.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it sends
out a pulse, it's

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
like a field of energy
that goes around.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It surrounds something and
doesn't allow that target

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:90%
to do anything.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
It almost incapacitates
them, freezes them.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.330 align:middle line:84%
That's one of my
favorite weapon systems,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
because then we can actually--
if we need to interrogate

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
or if we need to
bring them back--

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
they're maybe a thief
or maybe a murderer

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is-- and the
galactic council or whatever

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
wants them for
whatever reason, then

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we capture them and put them in
this one little freezing device

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:90%
type thing.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It freezes all energy,
all thought energy.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So they won't be able
to communicate with us

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and try and say, hey, let me go.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So this particular energetic
field device stops all action,

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:90%
stops all nerve functions.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It lets them at least have
enough circulatory system

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:90%
function that keeps them alive.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
everything shut down.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell us, scientifically,
what is this energy field that

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:90%
contains the prisoner?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is energy.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
We've learned how to
make atomic energy.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
We've learned how to
make energy so we have

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:90%
spaceships to fly to the moon.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:90%
This is all this energy.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have learned how to use
energy in very positive ways

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%
and obviously, sometimes--

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
if we have to-- negative ways--
a pulse energy that goes out

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that basically
destroy something.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is a pulse energy device
that basically pulses out.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It creates a field of energy--

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:90%
quantum connection.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
We want it to work
a certain way.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:90%
The energy goes out.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Just like we can use
energy to create food--

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
we actually have devices that
create food on our aircraft

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Or here on Earth, we have
those technologies too.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of not
disclosed yet, but kind of

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:90%
like a little microwave.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%
You plug in what you want the--

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:84%
the energy, once it comes in--
what you want it to conform to.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Like, I want a pizza.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So that energy
forms into a pizza.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So these energy
fields are something

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
we've learned how to work
with very early on where

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
we learn the vibration
of certain objects.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the same process,
a vibrational field

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:84%
which basically freezes all
activity within its field.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand completely
all of these energy fields

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and technologies,
but I have memories

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that are coming through
where I work with them.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do these
technologies arise from?

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of them arise from
us, from back engineering some

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of the ET technology
which we've gotten.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
We've done a lot of
different things with it.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:90%
That's just one aspect.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:84%
We look at throughout the
past, our past here on Earth.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:84%
The military usually gets
a lot of technologies,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
advanced with them,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
which I can say they are
very advanced with them,

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
very, very far more
advanced than we have.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's by design
because we want

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
the best for our troops to
be able to handle situations.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If we're technologically
superior,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times we
won't get messed with.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of what we're
doing in the Space Force.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:90%
We take technologies.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:90%
We're constantly evolving them.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:84%
In the earlier days when we used
these technologies to dominate

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
other groups--
and here on Earth,

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
they were used to
dominate other groups--

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.722 align:middle line:84%
the ETs weren't so forthgiving
unless it was to their benefit,

00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and they were
negative because they

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.150 align:middle line:84%
wanted to use that
negative technology

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
for negative enslavement
and so forth.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.915 align:middle line:84%
So as we've advanced, as
we've become more at one,

00:09:25.915 --> 00:09:28.210 align:middle line:84%
these loving technologies
or loving energies

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're using
now, now they're

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:84%
starting to cooperate
more with us.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
They're giving even
more higher technology.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So instead of
killing that being,

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:84%
we're able to
capture that being.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.222 align:middle line:84%
And that's far more
superior in the long run

00:09:41.222 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:84%
than actually blowing
something to smithereens,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.863 align:middle line:84%
and no one really
wins in the long run.

00:09:45.863 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> In your regression
with Barbara Lamb,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
you did mention love being
a mechanism to defeat evil.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.663 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:54.665 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest wow for me was
the love vibration that they

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:84%
were teaching us, because
I'd learn how to be very,

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
very militaristic, very focused,
working with the Nazi groups.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They were always very
angry, very negative

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:90%
in the way they trained.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:84%
There was-- sometimes
they used fear.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.245 align:middle line:90%
They tried to use fear.

00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Even though we were
trained not to have fear,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
they tried to use that
as a manipulation tool.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The Venusians were
never like that at all.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:90%
There was no fear.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It was not part of
their consciousness.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Very, very loving, very
gentle, very beautiful people.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
They've helped us
to build starships.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
They've helped us
to integrate love

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
into different technologies, how
to take our vibrational fields

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and shift them to other
people, to other beings,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:84%
If they were feeling
low, negative, you

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
could take your very
positive field of energy

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and direct it to them and
change their energy fields

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and help them.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it would be
of a healing nature.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it would just
be of an uplifting nature.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the physical
effect on these people

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:90%
when you did that.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So these were some of
the things that we were

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:90%
trained by the Venusians to do.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And as we got very,
very adept at that,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
then we would take that into
our actual battle space.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
We started to connect
with our enemies

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.248 align:middle line:84%
and change the field of our
enemies to more positive.

00:11:41.248 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you define
love as a technology?

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an excellent question.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that
regression, it really

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
brought up a lot of stuff,
a lot of stuff that I've

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:90%
been advanced in here.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But it took me to a different
level in the Space Force.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So in the Space
Force, we use love

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of different ways.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a consciousness,
yes, but we also

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:84%
can connect that consciousness
with different technologies.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look
at, here on Earth,

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the Venusians basically
work with Eisenhower

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and helped Eisenhower advance
the technologies and starships

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and starfleets and so forth.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Then we look at even Apple
computer Steve Jobs, I believe,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:90%
was influenced by Venusians.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
He put that into
the Apple computer.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs was, I think, a
very loving, very giving soul,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
just like the Venusians
are teaching us.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's technology that we are
all integrated with right now.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Space Force, that
goes to an incredibly high-tech

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So not only do we have it within
our smart devices like we're

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.800 align:middle line:84%
seeing on Earth, which are
far more advanced in the Space

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Force than we're seeing here,
but also in the technologies

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:90%
of the ship.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So the ship itself,
the technology--

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
we look at crystalline
energies and so forth.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
There's actual love connection
that crystalline structures

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:90%
have with us.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So once we connect with
that crystalline energy,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we integrate it into different
things like technologies

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:90%
in our own brain.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Our pineal gland has a
crystalline structure on it--

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
the calcite crystals that are
actually on the pineal gland.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So crystalline structures not
only within our own bodies

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
but also in our craft, in our
weapon systems, and so forth

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
help us to make those informed
and unbelievable decisions.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So love-- every time we're using
these different technologies,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
people are like, you're shooting
something, you're having love?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:90%
You have that love energy.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a quantum level
of a connection.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That quantum-level
connection allows

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
us to go to different
levels with it.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we didn't have
that love connection

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
with our technologies,
they wouldn't respond at--

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you saying--

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Michael, are you saying that
the crystalline structure

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of your body and DNA
is also connected

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to these weapons and craft and
that's how this is relayed?

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a fantastic
question, because, yes, it is.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think once people start
to understand that, that even

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:84%
with our computers that we
have now, even with the iPads,

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
there's crystalline
structure within there,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and once you start to understand
it, you start to link--

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
because that iPad is
definitely linking with you,

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:90%
as we're starting to see.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
If you link with it, you can
start to actually control that.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've done that with a
lot of my smart technology

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It happens in the Space Force
on an unbelievable level.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I get very
frustrated after coming out

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of the projects and I'm
faster than the computer.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're also
seeing in the Space Force,

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're far ahead of some of
the technologies that's there.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we're
on a quantum level.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
They're higher
dimensional awareness.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They're higher
dimensional technologies.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And once you make that
conscious connection with it,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
then it allows you to go to
these unbelievable levels.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing I did when
I was in the SEAL teams

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:90%
was I did the same thing.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is one thing
that I'm learning

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that the same connection that
I have in the Space Force

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to some of the
things I've experienced here.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to draw my weapon
and fire it three times at head

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
targets and hit
three head targets

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.492 align:middle line:90%
within less than a second.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So there were a
lot of us that were

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:90%
trained to do it at that speed.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
The same thing would
happen with my knife.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I could draw my knife and
hit into the ocular cavity,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
into the brainstem,
in 0.3 seconds.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael, who are
we fighting in space?

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, just like we have
here, there are negative groups.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.610 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't go in some
neighborhoods alone.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And you won't go into some
neighborhoods in space

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:90%
without having good weaponry.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And to think that everything
is all love and peace,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't happen here on Earth,
and it doesn't happen in space.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So there are problems in
space that we overcome.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:90%
But we're overcoming them.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:84%
There is peace,
peacefulness in space.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.613 align:middle line:90%
We're higher consciousness, yes.

00:16:36.613 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, when we rise
to a higher consciousness--

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:90%
even in space--

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth eventually,
there is less fighting.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's our goal, to raise
the consciousness in space

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and stop out some of
these warring groups.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest obstacle
that we have right now,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
warring groups that,
just like here on Earth,

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:90%
they're very materialistic.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
They're very egoic, and
they want to control,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:90%
and they want to master people.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're overcoming
in the Space Force.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:84%
>> You speak about love
and light amongst the stars

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
and these
extraterrestrial races.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
war going on of sorts.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, these-- it's not
necessarily a war throughout

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:84%
the galaxy, although
those have existed before.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Mainly there's
pockets of negativity

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.008 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
address on occasion.

00:17:32.008 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>> How is that addressed?

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:90%
How is that measured?

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> How that's measured,
basically, is,

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
just like we have here on Earth,
like we talked about earlier,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:90%
we have human--

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:90%
or even ET trafficking.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not just humans
are being trafficked.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Also other ET races are
being trafficked and sold

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:90%
into slavery.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the
weaponry and the drugs

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Same thing we see on the
Earth is happening in space.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we think of, like, we're
raising our consciousness,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
like we talk about with the
Venusians and stuff like that.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone is exposed to that.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Just like we had here on Earth,
we had the peace, love, hippie

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
movement, but still we
had the Vietnam War.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
They were trying
to stop that out,

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't work,
unfortunately.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So we still have
these resistances

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to the peace and love
that are out there.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:90%
So we're trying to finesse that.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get
to raise consciousness

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
as much as we can to come in
and deal with those situations.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But, still, sometimes
you have to come in hard.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what a lot of
people here on Earth know.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
They only know
force, unfortunately.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
If you come at ETs
with finesse and force,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%
it works out a lot better.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:90%
There's less destruction.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There's less
negativity long term.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to come in
and mitigate these problems

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:90%
the best that you can.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there are some sort
of control factor amongst

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials and Earth?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Is someone puppeteering
our planet?

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The puppeteering's been
going on for thousands

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:90%
of years, millenia.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And we progressed at one point
during the Atlantean-Lemurian

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:90%
era, and there was a big war.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just spoke
recently with someone

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:90%
that had insights into that.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians were
helping us evolve.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And they still are.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
They've come back.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they
help us a great extent.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But that love energy,
like we're talking about,

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
if it's not always
there, someone

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:90%
can come in and dominate.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened during
the Lemurian-Atlantean time

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
frame where we had a Draco
Reptilian force that came

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:90%
in and basically dominated--

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:90%
subjugated humanity.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
They infiltrated a group
and coerced that group--

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
kind of like what
we're seeing now--

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to go negative and try
and enslave humanity,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and that group
went along with it,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and there was
destruction that happened

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:90%
during Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.385 align:middle line:84%
Now, they were 5D
back then, something

00:20:07.385 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to get to now.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We're 4D, moving
to 5D right now.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's still going to
take a little bit of effort.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:84%
That same resistance
and problems

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing
here on Earth

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
happen in other
areas of the galaxy.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.462 align:middle line:90%
But we're one of the last ones.

00:20:25.462 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
We're the last to hold
out here on Earth.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's kind of looking,
waiting, and watching.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, some people theorize
that space combat technology

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.802 align:middle line:90%
does actually affect timelines.

00:20:35.802 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Could you enlighten us
a little bit about that?

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So I was involved
in timeline wars

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:90%
for a period of several years.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:90%
So-- and it's still ongoing.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
It's still happening
right now as we speak.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
These timeline
wars, for my memory,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
was there was a group
of us-- usually four--

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that would sit in
these basically chairs.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
We'd be back to
back to each other.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was, like, a
large tube in the center.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was a ball of
light that went around.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
There were probes, I think,
that went into our heads.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
maintained our bodies

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:84%
while our consciousness and our
body form went back in time.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:90%
That was plugged in.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
There was different
technologies for determining

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:90%
where we would go to.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was determined
by the actions

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
from the future.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So, from the
future, we would see

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.433 align:middle line:84%
anomalies that were
happening where

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
things were supposed to be
working out a certain way

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and they were changed.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:84%
One of those was that
Lincoln was not assassinated

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and then that Lincoln
was assassinated,

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.875 align:middle line:84%
that the Civil War
was won by the South

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and the Civil War
was won by the North.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So these manipulations of these
timelines are still ongoing.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go back in time
and stop those groups out--

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
so usually four-man
teams and they

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
have historical understanding of
what happened during that time

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:90%
frame.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:90%
They're in historical gear.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
They have clothing from
that historical time frame.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they go in,
and they stop out

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
another group that's
trying to change

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
the timeline by
assassinating the president

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
or assassinating
a business figure

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.225 align:middle line:84%
or assassinating a key
person in time that

00:22:24.225 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
is going to have an effect
that ripples up in time.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And from the future,
we see these changes.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So we have different
timelines that are constantly

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:90%
in action are all around us.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:84%
There are groups
that try to push us

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
into a negative timeline
where they have control.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to go back
and stop that so it comes back

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:90%
into the right timeline.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of manipulations

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of different
levels that happen.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We could do a whole
episode just on this alone.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's go look at your
regression about time wars.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
- Around the time frame where
I was 21 to 24 years old,

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in the early
stages of the time war.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
There could only be for
people that could travel.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
We were set up in a grid where
we would lie back in a chair,

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and our heads were
all close together.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was, like,
some light equipment

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that was at the head that would
spin around that would change

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:90%
the vibration.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:84%
There was a setting that was
put into this particular time

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.230 align:middle line:84%
machine that would
transport us back

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:84%
to an era where we knew
there was going to be

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:90%
a manipulation of the time.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
The group that was
normally involved in this

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.320 align:middle line:84%
were trying to change the
consciousness on Earth

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.180 align:middle line:90%
to a negative time frame.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:84%
There are many
timelines that exist.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Some timelines, like we exist
on right now, are very solid.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And all around us are
multiple different timelines.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
In the space program, we
started to literally transport

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
in spacecraft back in time
so that we could have groups

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of warriors that could go back
and fix the timelines to battle

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
against those that were trying
to change the timelines.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
My role, at first during
the timeline wars,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
was as a soldier in the
early days, in my early 20s.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Then, eventually, I would
be in charge of ships.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Then I would be in
charge of whole groups,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
calculating how these timeline
wars were being manipulated.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we see a ripple.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
There's instrumentation
that we can see

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:90%
when they ripple a timeline.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And it changes different things
that are happening currently.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we send people
back to go research it

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and find out what
has been manipulated.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, we'll
find that they have actually

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.930 align:middle line:84%
changed an event
in history that was

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
meant to happen and make the
timeline perfect the way it

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:05.970 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Higher-dimensional
beings are what helps us

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:90%
with these timeline wars.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:90%
They keep us informed.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are giving
us the technology, oftentimes.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Five and six-- seven
sometimes-- dimensional beings--

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness can
detect this information.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
They can detect
the manipulations.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Where we would look
at something and we'd

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
see something's not right,
they can tell us instantly

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that the timeline
has been changed.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:90%
We are in the present.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Then there's future selves that
are monitoring the timeline.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And if they see a ripple in
the timeline, in the future,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
then they connect with us.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
They contact us
and let us know--

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:84%
those that are involved
in the timeline wars--

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that we need to do
research and find out

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
what is happening
in a certain ripple.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:90%
We trace it back.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
We go back, and we fix
that ripple in time.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a track that doesn't
lead to a good ending.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a track that leads
into a future that

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
is very dark, very difficult
for humanity and other ET races.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So pushing those timelines
back towards where

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:84%
they're supposed to be is part
of the timeline wars agenda.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
As we go back in time, as we fix
things, more things get broken.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a continual
war that happens.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a war that's going
on right now, constantly.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
The only way to fix
these is to eliminate

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are causing
these timeline wars.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.866 align:middle line:90%
This takes time.

00:26:48.866 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael, tell us a
little bit more about that.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a fascinating subject
and one that I've seen a lot

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:90%
of people talk about.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So we think that time travel--
maybe we just started doing it.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
No, it's been going on for
a very, very long time.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually fly back in
specialized craft into the past

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
or even into the
future if we need to,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.178 align:middle line:84%
but normally into the
past because that's

00:27:11.178 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:84%
where the timeline
changes are happening.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So we go back in time,
and we hit a certain point

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:84%
where our computers
are taking us

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.328 align:middle line:84%
or our instrumentation says that
this is where the action is.

00:27:23.328 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So we come in, and we find
those different groups

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:90%
that are causing the problem.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:90%
We stop them out.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:90%
So there's a war.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually fighting
that sometimes is going on.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
People die.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the early
days, this technology

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:90%
wasn't so advanced, though.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.927 align:middle line:84%
You had to have particular
people that were involved in it

00:27:40.927 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
because they would-- their
consciousness would get

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.202 align:middle line:84%
scrambled or they
would get PTSD--

00:27:46.202 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
like we talk about
now-- to a point

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
where they would not work
out in the future or anymore.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So I saw the technology
advancing over time.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Today, it's extremely advanced.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We can go and stop this
stuff out very, very rapidly.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> When did we first
start time traveling?

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's actually a little
before I was involved in it.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it goes all the
way back to the '60s.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
When I was involved with
it was in the early '80s.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 20s in
the Space Force.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So I volunteered
for the program.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I knew the program
had been ongoing.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I was intrigued by it.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:90%
I was always into history.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.235 align:middle line:90%
I loved history.

00:28:26.235 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the things that they

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:84%
wanted, as well, someone that
was very historically astute.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So I was very astute in
history because I studied it

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they sent me
back with another group.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So we were very effective
in the early days.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It became harder and
harder as technology

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:90%
advanced on either side.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So their technology
would get better.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:84%
When we flew back sometimes,
they would destroy aircraft,

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we
got stuck in time,

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and somebody had
to come rescue us.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
different things

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that were and are happening
in those timeline wars.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it a craft that you
traveled, or is it a portal?

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:90%
How do you get back and forth?

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.810 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned a craft.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Are these time-traveling crafts?

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>> They can be
time-traveling craft.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But there have been portals
that have been open in the past.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
In the early days, like
in the '60s and so forth,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
they were using portaling
to send people back,

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and that had a lot
of problems with it.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely had.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And many people have
been lost in those programs.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:90%
So I got involved in it.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
It was actually-- like I said,
you were rooted at one time.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they got to the
point where we actually

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.530 align:middle line:84%
have craft that actually
travel back in time.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So these craft are
designed in a way

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
that they can move at an
extremely fast rate, faster

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They move back to
a certain period

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and then link with a certain
timeline, land, and those guys

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:90%
get out, do their mission.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in
a few of those.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:84%
That technology has
advanced even more.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's even
more craft that have

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:84%
been designed that are even
faster, can hold more people.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
At first, it was
just a few people

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that could go back--
three or four people.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, there can be groups
of up to 25-30 can go back.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we wrap this up,
could you please tell me,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.793 align:middle line:90%
who is the Space Force?

00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an excellent
question because there's lots

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of different ET races that
are involved in this secret--

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:84%
not secret in the Space Force
but secret for us on Earth.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But when we're out
in space, there's

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.540 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of different
ETs are involved.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.305 align:middle line:84%
That kind of disclosure
will eventually

00:30:43.305 --> 00:30:44.180 align:middle line:90%
happen here on Earth.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.660 align:middle line:84%
People were still not
completely up to speed

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:84%
on their ET brothers
and sisters we

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.353 align:middle line:84%
have that are actually
among us right now.

00:30:53.353 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that's going
to be a little

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:90%
shocking for some people.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.658 align:middle line:84%
But most of us, I
think, are to the point

00:30:57.658 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:84%
where we're like, OK,
we're ready for this.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's just move on.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's get this show on the road.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:84%
In the Space Force,
we're completely involved

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%
with other ET races--

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:90%
It's at an undescribable level.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And the cooperation,
the loving intent

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking about
is there in the Space Force.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And that-- as we
move forward, we'll

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:84%
become more and
more aware of that.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But here on Earth, in our
Space Force, it's just humans.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, there may be still an
ET influence, like we saw--

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.300 align:middle line:84%
like I talked about with
the Eisenhower era where

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.020 align:middle line:84%
the Venusians came in and
helped out and other positive ET

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:90%
races--

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians, Andromedans, and--
there's many, many different--

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadians and so forth.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
different races are--

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.650 align:middle line:84%
in secret-- involved
to a certain level

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and, in some levels,
at a very great level.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So as we move forward, we'll
see more and more of that.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But the Space
Force here on Earth

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much humanoid, period.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about the
Earth, the Space Force.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, who on Earth is
that default program?

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it the Americans?

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it the Russian?

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Is it from China?

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Every country.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.248 align:middle line:84%
So every country has
humans in the Space Force

00:32:24.248 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
because there's only
a certain amount

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of people that can
handle the consciousness

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and the energies that are
demanded of the Space Force.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.022 align:middle line:90%
So they look throughout all--

00:32:34.022 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
which is a beautiful
thing once you

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.660 align:middle line:84%
start to understand that all
of humanity here on Earth

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
right now, as a
collective, can be

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
very valuable in the Space Force
if we start to learn about it.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But at this point right now,
there's just a chosen few

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:84%
from each country over
time that have been

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:90%
pulled into the Space Force.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.598 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
pleasure to have you.

00:32:58.598 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
being here, Emery,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:90%
and I've had such great time.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing all the
information that you have.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.992 align:middle line:84%
And in the future, I look
forward to sharing more.

00:33:06.992 --> 00:33:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:10%
