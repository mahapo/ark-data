>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.660 align:middle line:10%
UFO-ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Today, we are discussing
Operation Tan Cotton.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

to be here, Emery.

>>EMERY: All right, fill us in.

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:90%
What is Operation Tan Cotton?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Wow, this is
a sensational story

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:84%
that comes right out of
the annals of the Central

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Agency.

Classified history.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It's told to us by
a CIA case officer

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
who spent 35 years with the
Central Intelligence Agency.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
He actually spent time in
Bulgaria, where this originated.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
They go back, to start
the story in 1953.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Something crashed
near a farmer's field

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:84%
in Northwestern Bulgaria,
right near the Romanian

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.545 align:middle line:90%
and Yugoslavian border.

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It was in a remote area.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:90%
The farmer saw this thing crash.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And a few days
after, he went out

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to try to find
exactly what it was.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it might have been
a meteorite or a meteor.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is 1953 time frame,
Bulgaria was, remember,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:90%
a communist country.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
The farmer, he worked
at a collective farming

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.400 align:middle line:84%
but the Bulgarian
government allowed

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:90%
them to have a plot of land.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
He lived in this
remote farmhouse

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:90%
with his wife and his child.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And he'd lived there
for a number of years.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
He drove out with a tractor
and found this object that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:90%
was embedded into the soil.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't very big.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
It was about three meters
in circumference conference

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and about a meter
and a half wide.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea what it was.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1953, UFOs
in foreign countries

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:90%
probably was unheard of.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
So he then told another person
that he knew about this object.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
This other person came over and
looked at the object and said,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:90%
it's a meteor.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.315 align:middle line:90%
It came from space.

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was a gray-colored
saucer-shaped object.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
There was no ports or
portals or doors or windows.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was no way to get
into it that they could find.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they
actually tried to use

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:90%
sledgehammers to break it open.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:90%
And nothing opened it.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So eventually-- and
this is where there are

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:90%
some redactions to the story.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, a deep cover
CIA operative operating

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:90%
inside Bulgaria learned of this.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to go to
the scene, meet the farmer.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And the farmer showed
him where this thing was.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, this operative went back
and told his case officer,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
eventually contacted the
case officer, in Sofia,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:84%
at the capital of
Bulgaria, US embassy.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, the CIA knows about this.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:90%
The CIA was curious--

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:90%
says, what is this?

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was a photograph
taken by the agent

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:90%
and gave it to the case officer.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:90%
And they looked at it.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized--
and this is 1953.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They realized, wow,
that looks like one

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
of these flying saucers that are
being seen in the United States.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So now, they want
to form a plan.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.952 align:middle line:84%
OK, they want to go
there and examine it.

00:03:52.952 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So now, even though
Bulgaria was somewhat open,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
it was still a
communist country.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And the KGB had
a major influence

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
on the internal security
system of Bulgaria.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't as easy as just
to drive an embassy vehicle up

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:90%
there and look at it.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So it had to do
everything covertly.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:90%
So they did this.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:84%
They actually put together
a three-person team

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to go up there, make
contact with the farmer.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is several
hundred kilometers away

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:90%
from the capital of Sofia.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:90%
So they get there.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And they examined it.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And the consensus of the people
that we're examining it--

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:90%
one was a scientist--

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
is that this thing
didn't come from Earth.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:90%
And so they go back.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And they send all the
information up to Washington,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
saying, it probably is one
of these flying saucers.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do we do?

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do with it?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We can't examine it
in a farmer's field.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It seems pretty heavy.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:90%
How do we get it out of there?

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the wheels of the CIA
and the US State Department

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:90%
started turning.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And they developed this plan.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:90%
It was quite an elaborate plan.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The only way to actually get
something out of that area

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
was to transport it
from the crash site

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
to the Danube River north of
there, a couple of kilometers

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:90%
north of the farmers field.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The Danube River ran all the way
from Germany through Austria,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
communist countries,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and all the way out through
Romania to the Black Sea.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So now, they had to figure out,
how are they going to do this?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:84%
The plan calls for a barge
to come down the river.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The CIA would have
to figure out how

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to get that craft over to the
barge, put it on the barge,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
not only put it on the barge
but hide it on the barge

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
that would then go out to the
Black Sea and, from that point,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
onto a Turkish ship
that could take it

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to one of the ports in Northern
Turkey and then eventually try

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.242 align:middle line:84%
to get back to
the United States.

00:06:06.242 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a
lot of logistics.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: A lot of logistics.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But what they did was
there were free access

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
for certain countries to
move freight and commodities

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:90%
on the Danube.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:10%
One of them was Austria.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
They've licensed to
be on the Danube.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And although custom
personnel would

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
check to Yugoslavia and
to communist countries,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
but they normally could
operate in the open

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:90%
without any problems.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So they had to
then figure out how

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to get it the several
kilometers up to the river.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And then everything had
to be coordinated by time

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't leave
this thing out in the open.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So they had to do everything
in split second timing groups.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The case officer was
explaining this to us,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
said they were on the
clock from the beginning

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
when that barge
first leaves Austria

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and when it got to the border.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And I remember.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
This is up near the border
of Romania and Yugoslavia.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So he got customs,
Yugoslavia customs,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:90%
which was a communist country.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Tito was the ruler of
Yugoslavia and Romania,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
which is also a communist
country at that time.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They planned this
perfectly and timing wise.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
They were able to get the
farmer's tractor and a trailer,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
placed this thing
on the trailer,

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and then drove it all the
way up to the shoreline,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:90%
up to the Danube River.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, this thing is
like nine feet by--

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Small.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's not very big.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.950 align:middle line:84%
They realized it weighed 1,800
pounds or something to that

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So they had to bring
other people in.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want to tip off
Bulgarian intelligence service,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:90%
which was controlled by the KGB.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:90%
And they were amateurs.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty
watchful, especially

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the American embassy
and American personnel

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:90%
in the embassy.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Although not every single
American was surveilled,

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.488 align:middle line:84%
the suspected CIA
personnel were.

00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And there weren't that many
in the embassy at the time.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
There was a handful
of CIA personnel.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Bulgaria wasn't that important
country at that time.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, they moved a
lot of people up there.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And they had to do it
over a period of time

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
so there wouldn't be any
suspicion of what we were doing.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
But finally, they got the barge.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:90%
The first barge that came down.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
They realized it
wasn't big enough.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:90%
They had to let that barge go.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
They had to coordinate with
the people in Australia

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:90%
to send a bigger barge down.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, over a
period of several weeks,

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
they got the right
barge down there.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But during this time frame,
the local police, the militia,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
became suspicious of what
was occurring up here.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:90%
So now, what do we do?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:90%
What does CIA do?

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately, they
were able to co-opt

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
a couple policemen, Bulgarian
policemen, and paid them off.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.872 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And the bigger
barge came down.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
They were able to load this
thing under a section of it, put

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
other commodities
in it on the outside

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to prevent any customs
officials because it

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
had to go-- even though
it was in Bulgaria,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:90%
it had to go into Romania.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And Romanian customs is
going to examine this thing.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to try to
figure out, well, what is this?

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And so it worked.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
They were able to put
the saucer on the barge,

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
hide it under commodities,
and move it forward.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the people running this
barge had to be co-opted.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And they were Austrians.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
There were a Bulgarian
that was also

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
on that barge who had to
be co-opted or brought

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:90%
under our control.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:90%
And so they did all this.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything went great until
they got up to constant port--

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that was what it was called--
of Romania to move it out

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
to the Turkish ship
that we had coordinated

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:84%
with the Turkish government
to take up there.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the Turkish ship
contained US Navy personnel

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:90%
operating that ship.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
US Navy personnel

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
were either Native Turkish
or spoke Turkish fluently.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But the ship was off the
shore, not close to the port.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:84%
When they got up there, Romanian
customs became suspicious.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
This weighed too
much with whatever

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
the commodities were, the
groceries or whatever items.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:90%
It weighed too much.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And it got up there late.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So the Romanian customs
officials told them, listen,

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
you can't leave until
the next morning

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:90%
because we have to weigh you.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And we can't bring a weight
in or whatever system

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:90%
they use to weigh.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So they assigned this
Romanian police officer

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:84%
to watch this barge
so it wouldn't move

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:90%
right until the next morning.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.335 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, see, I figured,
what are we going to do?

00:11:03.335 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:90%
We can't wait till morning.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Because once they wait, it's
going to realize these farm

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:84%
products don't weigh as
much as the 1,900 pounds.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So they decided to act.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:90%
So they took off.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They drugged the
Romanian police officer.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:90%
They took him with them.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And out to the
Turkish ship, they

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
managed to transfer the saucer
onto this Turkish vessel

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and left the Romanian
police officer

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
on that barge,
positioned the barge

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
so it would go
back towards port--

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:90%
they didn't want to harm him.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the Turkish ship would
then start heading towards--

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
well, in the meantime, a
Romanian Coast Guard boat

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:84%
sees what's happening but
doesn't suspect anything

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:90%
They just see what's happening.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is 3 o'clock
in the morning.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.675 align:middle line:84%
And they become
suspicious, finally.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And the commander of the
remaining Coast Guard boat

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
says, let's go check
that Turkish boat out.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:90%
What did that barge do?

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:90%
And so forth.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the
Romanian Coast Guard

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:14.232 align:middle line:84%
drives to the Turkish ship,
demands that it stops.

00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
armed down there?

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Or are they like this?

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:90%
The CIA or--

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: The CIA are armed.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.920 align:middle line:90%
The Navy personnel are armed.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't want
a confrontation.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to have
an armed confrontation.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:84%
A Romanian Coast
Guard man got on board

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and said, what are
you guys doing?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And the story is we are
unloading that barge.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed
to do it earlier.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But your customs people
wouldn't allow it.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And they finally let us do it.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Coast Guard people
said the port closes

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time period.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember what
that time period was.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And nothing can
occur until daylight.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:90%
So why are you leaving?

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, because we
have our equipment.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It took a long time.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But they eventually talked the
Romanian Coast Guard person,

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
the commander,
into understanding

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:90%
what their position was.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So Romanian Coast Guard
commander said, OK, you can go.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, they
avoided that confrontation.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Was there any other
confrontations?

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, actually, they
didn't avoid this confrontation.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, they didn't?

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The Coast Guard, the
Romanian Coast Guard, boat,

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But as it radioed to
shore, they were told,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
no, stop that ship because
it illegally entered

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Romanian territorial waters.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Turkish ship
was monitoring the radio

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:90%
transmission and then sped up.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So there was some form
of a confrontation

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:84%
where the remaining Coast Guard
ship fired on the Turkish ship.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Turkish ship never
fired back, just kept going,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and basically outraced that
small Romanian Coast Guard boat.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
When the boat got in
international waters,

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
because in the Black Sea,
there was international waters,

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
the Romanian boat
ceased to follow.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And the Turkish ship
then docked in Sinop.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And they unloaded the cargo.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So where did
they deliver this craft?

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:90%
And where did it go from there?

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: A port called
Sinop in Northern Turkey.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So they had to drive
about two hours to Ankara.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
They had to unload it,
take it to an airfield,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
which was an Air Force base,
the American Air Force base.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
A C-124 cargo plane--
back in those days,

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:90%
these things are huge.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:10%
They could carry
virtually anything.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:84%
They were going to load it
on that C-124 cargo plane

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and fly it to West Germany
and then unload it.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So from Germany, I'm
assuming they went directly

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Then what happened?

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: It was actually put on
another transport plane, a C-97,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:10%
which was a kind of a
newer transport plane

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:10%
in the '50s, and flown to
Wright-Patterson Air Force base.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.022 align:middle line:10%
Remember, Area 51
didn't exist in 1953.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have
any other place

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to examine these things except
for Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
base, where the Air
Technical Center was located.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually part of
this whole operation, the Air

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Force Technical
Operations Center.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So once the plane
got there, the saucer

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:90%
was transported to a hangar.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And guess what number
that hangar was.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
That was Hangar 13,
literally Hangar 13.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It was placed inside that
hangar, heavily guarded

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:90%
by Air Force air policemen.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And now, technical
personnel had to come in

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.290 align:middle line:90%
and try to open this thing.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, that wasn't an easy task.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
It took literally weeks
to open this thing up.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And when they finally
determined a way

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of breaking the seal or
whatever technique they use,

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
because that wasn't ever told
to us, they did open it up.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And when they got inside,
they found these 5-foot tall

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:90%
They were dead.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But they had not
deteriorated at all.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies were in
pristine condition.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But as they started
looking around the craft,

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
they noticed everything in
that craft was in English.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The control panels
were in English.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:90%
The wall charts were in English.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.270 align:middle line:84%
There were these big
screens with English titles.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Dumbfounded-- the scientists
were actually dumbfounded.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
We found a civilization
that used our language.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did
the ETs look like?

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:90%
What species were these?

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They were humans.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They were humans.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Here's the thing.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
In December 1953, when
they opened the craft,

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
the bodies were taken out and
put in some type of deep freeze

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84%
or suspended animation
or whatever they used.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure how that worked.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But jump ahead, we didn't
have technology in 1953

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:90%
to fully understand this.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Jump ahead to 2002,
the scientists

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
now realized that this craft
was probably made on Earth.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.984 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking
at was time travelers--

00:17:08.984 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, from the future.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They came back from
the future in a smaller craft.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, our
bodies were smaller.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:90%
They crashed into Bulgaria.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And for all those years
that we couldn't figure out

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
why this craft was
all in English inside,

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
we determined that it was
probably these creatures

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:90%
were actually humans.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
And they were time travelers.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you saying they're
descendants of you and I?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were
descendants of you and I.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how did they
come to this conclusion?

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, number
one, the materials

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that the craft was made
of has some remnants

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:90%
of what we have on Earth.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, they suspected
this is maybe

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:90%
thousand years in the future.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:90%
And they came back in time.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we probably
developed this material

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:84%
in order to fly in space,
space travel or time travel.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so they put all this
together, two and two together.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And they come to the conclusion
it's probably time travel.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
What other possibility
could there be for these--

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:90%
of course, they're dead.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:90%
So we can't talk to them.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But the material in their
suits, they looked like humans.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:90%
They had human organs.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And the craft's English
language and the materials--

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
probably made on Earth
but in the future.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were perfectly
preserved inside this thing,

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of odd to me.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
But I guess, without
any outside air,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.740 align:middle line:84%
you might know more
about it than I do,

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
that maybe these things could
be preserved inside this craft.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And remember, if they came from
the future here to the past,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe they have some
system inside that craft

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to preserve them just in case
this might have happened.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's possible
they're not even dead too.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could be in a
state of animation of some sort.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.198 align:middle line:84%
When they travel, they
do that sometimes.

00:19:05.198 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The information
I got was they were dead.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were
probably buried later.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But the most interesting
part of this whole story,

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
as I told you earlier,
is DNA testing.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In 2002 and into
2003, we had DNA testing.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that we
decided to do, the scientists,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:90%
is take their DNA.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are plenty of places
they could get the DNA from.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:90%
They get the DNA.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the DNA
is almost identical to humans,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
except there were
additional strands.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the genetic scientists
figure that if we can live to be

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
in another 1,000 or 2,000
or 5,000 or 100,000 years,

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.192 align:middle line:90%
our DNA will probably change.

00:20:00.192 --> 00:20:00.992 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And that's why
they come to the conclusion

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.615 align:middle line:84%
that these are human
beings but from the future.

00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Was there
any other technology

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:10%
that we learned about
from them that was

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:10%
on the craft or
the craft itself?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Of course.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything inside that craft was
such advanced technology for us

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:90%
that we're studying it today.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:84%
20 some years later, we're
still examining this spacecraft,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
probably out at Area 51,
taking everything apart,

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:84%
try to look at, it and analyze
how our technology has changed

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:84%
or will change into the future
because now we have something

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
from the future that's here.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And now, we can look at it.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And that really will
help our scientists

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:49.032 align:middle line:84%
determine how our technology
will advance into the future.

00:20:49.032 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I think
this is a very important

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
find for the military and the
Americans and corporations

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:90%
because it's in English.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like an instruction book.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about this?

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:90%
What came out of this?

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.655 align:middle line:90%
And where is it going?

00:21:01.655 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we have the
ability to look at what

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:84%
our civilization will make in
the future, whether it's 10,000,

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:90%
100,000 years.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
We can look at it
and say, this is how

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.830 align:middle line:90%
our technology will develop.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll learn a
lot and probably already have

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
learned a lot by studying
this particular craft that

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:90%
came from the future.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, of
course, we did it.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.848 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: We did it.

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, that
gives me a lot of hope.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's going to give
the viewers a lot of hope moving

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
forward to know that
we are creating this.
