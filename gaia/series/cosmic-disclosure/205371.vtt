00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.420 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:10%
of Special investigations.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Today we are discussing remote
viewing in our solar system.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.417 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You were involved with remote
viewing projects that had to do

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:90%
with our solar system.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us how this
was conducted and set

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:90%
the scene for us?

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I was employed by the
Institute for Advanced Studies

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:90%
at Austin.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And during my time there,
I witnessed remote viewing

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
as some experiments
that were being done

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and some projects that involved
remote viewing outside Earth

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:90%
into the solar system.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And these remote viewers were
ex-military, retired military

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
remote viewers
working at other jobs,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
but they came in for
some special projects.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things
that they were doing

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things
they were remote viewing

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
were more or less a side
job for them, so to speak.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Now were they remote viewing
like specific coordinates?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe they were.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:84%
The first remote viewing
I saw was of Mars.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewer, a retired
military remote viewer,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:90%
one of the best of the best.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not sure
why or who told him

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:10%
to pick a particular
area of Mars,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:10%
but I believe it's called
the Argyre Basin of Mars.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:10%
One of our past spacecrafts,
it might have been Viking,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:10%
observed anomalies in the
geographical land area

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:10%
around this particular site.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to go
ahead and remote view

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:90%
that to determine what it was.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> You said anomalous.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Is this geography
or is it structures?

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Well they suspected
they were structures there.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And there were four different
points the Viking photographed.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
Vikings orbited the Mars first

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:90%
before it landed.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And they picked out what
appeared to be structures.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to
go in and remote

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:84%
view those areas to determine
whether they were structures

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
or whether it was a hill that
had been crushed by the wind

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:90%
or something on Mars.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you looking
for something specific?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> They were looking
for structures.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Structures.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
What types of structures
were they looking for?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Somehow somebody had evidence
or some kind of information

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that there were past
structures on Mars.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted
to determine about

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
whether these anomalies
were, in fact, structures,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
because they suspected
them to be structures.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
information came from NSA,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and NSA thought these
anomalies were structures.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on these structures
what was remote viewed?

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The area where the
structures were located.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
that was remote viewed

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
was the Argyre Basin of Mars.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And what the remote viewer
located there was a structure.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge,
massive structure,

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
partially above ground
and the rest underground.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:90%
It was about 3,000 feet long.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was very deep.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the remote
viewer looked into that,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
remote viewed it, determined
that there were rooms

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
underground, what
appeared to be rooms.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And what he located was what
he described as helicopters,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:90%
small flying devices.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:90%
They were round in shape.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:90%
They had propellers on top.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And they had bulges
on each side.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was a number of them--
and I don't remember a exact

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:90%
number--

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.162 align:middle line:90%
resting in a room--

00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a giant
hangar underground.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a giant
hangar underground.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And he also found what he
considered to be coffins deep

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:90%
under the surface.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
There were numerous
coffins, too many

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to be counted during a
remote viewing session.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions could
you determine what was inside?

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, but he was
convinced they were coffins.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
rooms in this structure

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:90%
that had been damaged.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:90%
There were pieces of concrete.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
He called them concrete
or some kind of material

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:90%
that broke off the wall.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So that was an indication
to him that this

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:90%
is a very, very old structure.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
It was massive in
length and height.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
On the top, the above ground
portion of this structure

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
had little, small
what he claimed

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:90%
to be windows or some portals.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Some parts of the top above
ground of this structure

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
had been damaged.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:90%
It had been broken.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:90%
The roof area had been broken.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But the deep inside where the
Martian helicopters, as he

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
called them, were
located had a portal

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
from one end that
went out outside,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
but the dirt and gravel had
blocked that exit going out.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So the consensus was that
this is a very, very, very

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
old, probably maybe even a
million years old structure,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
but he was able to describe
what I just told you.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any verification
of this later on down the road

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
by our new satellites and
our new ventures there?

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well considering that there's
a lot of information over

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
the years that is not
being released by NASA,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
there's photographs taken of
Mars that are still classified

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:90%
by NASA for some reason.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:90%
They have an excuse for it.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure over the years they
probably located this place

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and probably determined it was
some kind of an old structure

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
once housing a
civilization on Mars.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there any signs of
living entities or beings?

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
He found what he described
as coffins deep inside,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:90%
but there were no live entities.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did he conclude
they were coffins?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The shape, the
small shapes of them.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it was just a
consensus that they probably

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
were coffins and that may
be even a burial site.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I've seen similar
stuff on projects.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And as a remote viewer,
sometimes we can get confused--

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
not confused, but it
doesn't come out exactly

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:90%
like we think it does.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It's possible maybe
these are pods

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're in a state of
animation, frozen animation.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they're
waiting to be activated.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I hadn't thought of that.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
that the scientists

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:84%
at the time-- in the 1990s
when we were remote viewing

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:84%
considered that, but
that's highly possible.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be just pods waiting
to be reactivated in some way.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the remote viewer find
anything inside the rooms like

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:90%
furniture, computers?

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well he did find some
what appears to be blocks.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
He just called them blocks
in several of these rooms,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:84%
not knowing quite what
the blocks were used for.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
He didn't mention any kind
of electrical equipment,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:90%
such as computers.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But he did say there
were blocks in a number

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
of these different
rooms under the surface.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I'm aware you did
do another remote view

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
on a different part of Mars.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:84%
How was that determined
to remote view that part?

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I'm there as an observer
and they already had this

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:90%
planned.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure
how they determined

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
where they were
going to remote view,

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:90%
but they knew the exact target.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:90%
They knew where they wanted.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
they suspected

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:84%
it was another
building at this site.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:10%
And this site was the
Tharsis Montes section

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:10%
of Mars, which I believe
one of our Mars Rovers

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:10%
was close to at one
point in the early 2000s.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:90%
>> And what did they find here?

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> They found another structure,
a long, thin structure.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:84%
This structure went thousands
of feet underground.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:90%
The structure had shafts.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:90%
He viewed the shafts.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And the shafts had
ridges inside as

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
if there had been
something connected

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to these ridges inside
this long, deep shaft.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't determine
what these ridges were,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
but when he viewed the
bottom part of this shaft,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:90%
he found debris.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So probably at one
point, the ridges

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
contained some
type of structure.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And over time, the structure
broke apart and ended up

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the shaft.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:90%
Now on each side of this shaft--

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of like
a V-shaped shaft--

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:84%
there were exit points that
were leading out to the soil.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But of course, over time,
those entry and exit points

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
had been filled with
dirt or Martian soil.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So he wasn't sure exactly
what they were for,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
but it appeared that
there were maybe

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
launch places for vehicles
to launch or maybe

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to come back in.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they ever come up with
some hypothesis of why this was

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:90%
abandoned?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:90%
Are these considered ruins?

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the consensus was
they were ruins, Martian ruins.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
At one time, the
consensus-- and I

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
believe it's even
prominent within

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:84%
the astronomical community
that Mars contained life

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It might have been hundreds
of million years ago,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:90%
but there was life on Mars.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And something happened
to the atmosphere

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and they either died or
not sure whether where

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
the civilization went.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:90%
But Mars contained structures.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a civilization there
that built these structures.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
consensus of the people

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're analyzing these
remote viewing sessions.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Now do the remote viewers
ever since any living beings

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:90%
at this coordinates?

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:90%
There were no living beings.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
They tried to look
through every single room

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:90%
and every single structure.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
find any, what he

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
thought was coffins in
the second structure.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But he did his best to view,
to try to locate any beings

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:90%
or entities.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And there were none found.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about the third
session that was a little bit

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:90%
more south there in Mars.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The third session was in
the same area, Tharsis Montes.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:90%
And they found another building.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And this other building
had numerous rooms.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
of debris that was

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of this structure.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge structure.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:84%
He didn't get the
dimensions of the structure.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
He was concentrating on
other things I guess.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not an
expert in remote viewing,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
but he was doing his
best in the time allotted

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to the view the
entire structure.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:84%
But he found a lot of
debris in the bottom,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
as if there was other parts of
this structure that had broken

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:90%
off and ended up on the bottom.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was similar to the
second structure farther south

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
of that, but it was
another building

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and another evidence of a
civilization on the planet

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Mars.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you describe was this
above ground and below ground

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:90%
like the others?

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And were there rooms with
other materials in them,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:90%
or colors, or scents?

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Partially it
was above ground.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
It was constructed
partially above ground.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of it
was deep underground.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
The color was a light-colored
brownish color, not quite

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:84%
like what we would consider
concrete but a bland color.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And there were numerous rooms.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And most of the rooms
had pieces of material.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And he determined that to
be broken structures, maybe

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
the wall caved in or
something to that effect.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was no other
really prominent things

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that he talked about
that he found during it.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So that presents a
question that we had

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:84%
was, OK, if all these pieces
of concrete or materials

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that made this structure
was on the bottom,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
how did it all get
down to the bottom?

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean if this was a tight fit
structure underground, deep

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:84%
underground, some
thousands of feet

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
underground, how did it
break and get down there?

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't any explanation
on how all these blocks

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
or broken pieces
got on the bottom.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Now the bottom of
this one shaft,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
the third shaft or the third
structure, was very, very long.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have any
rooms that he could see,

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:84%
because there was so much
debris on the bottom.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Now was that a place where
they discarded something?

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that was a
depository of old material?

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.273 align:middle line:90%
Or how did that get down there?

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there
was an answer to that.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well did the remote viewers
ever signal about the past

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.590 align:middle line:90%
of this area, about the future?

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Were they destroyed by
a cataclysmic event?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Was there a war?

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You know did they ever
mention anything about that?

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well this consensus was
it was a catastrophic event,

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:84%
such as maybe an asteroid
hitting or something that was

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:90%
ending the civilization.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
another point was that

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
why were all these buildings
constructed underground mostly?

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:84%
If Mars was like Earth, which
some astronomers will talk

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:84%
about that Mars and Earth-like
a thousand, millions years ago,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
why did they build all these
structures underground?

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't there any
structures above ground?

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a question
I personally asked.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense to me that
all of them are underground.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe these
structures that we

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
found were something
special, maybe

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a
military structures

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that they were hiding
something from somebody else.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What were your conclusions
after seeing and knowing

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
everything that you learned
about Mars on this mission?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Well I was observer.

00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
interesting because I'm

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by remote viewing
exactly how they do it

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and the information that they
can obtain from remote viewing.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But they had experts there
that were analyzing everything

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that the remote
viewer was giving

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
to them, the sketches
that were made

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:90%
during this remote viewing.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm fascinated by the
system techniques used

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:84%
by the remote
viewer and the fact

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that our solar
system had probably

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
a thriving civilization
once on Mars.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's distinct
evidence of that

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.972 align:middle line:84%
and why we're not pursuing
that at this time.

00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you were also attended
a remote viewing session with

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter's moon Europa.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Why Europa?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why they chose
Europa, probably because there

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:90%
was so much activity.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:10%
And now this is in the '90s.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:10%
We didn't know as
much about Europa,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:10%
although we did have the
Voyager spacecrafts-- the two,

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:10%
Voyager 1 and Voyager 2--

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:10%
take pictures and analyzed a lot
of the atmosphere around Europa

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:10%
as it was traveling
out in space.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:90%
So maybe that's the reason.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But they decided to do
Europa, and they wanted

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:90%
to do the side facing Jupiter.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this particular
retired military remote viewer

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:90%
remote viewed.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was able to determined
because a remote viewer said do

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:90%
this side of Europa.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to do the
side where the geysers were

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:90%
shooting out of.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And even in the '90s, there was
a consensus amongst astronomers

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
ocean under Europa.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean there had have been
some kind of volcanic activity

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that caused these
geysers going off.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just the
gravitational pull

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.947 align:middle line:84%
of the planet Jupiter
against the moon,

00:16:44.947 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
but there had to be
some other reason.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So they were going
to remote view

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to determine what
they could observe.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Now nobody in the
room, or nobody

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that was going to
get the information

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.630 align:middle line:84%
from the remote viewer,
thought they would

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.165 align:middle line:90%
find what they found, which--

00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> What was revealed?

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
They remote viewed deep into
the ocean, underground ocean,

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:90%
of Europa.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And they found what appeared to
the remote viewer, in his mind,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.615 align:middle line:84%
to be octopuses,
numerous octopuses.

00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What size are
these octopuses?

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:84%
>> There were small Earth-sized
octopuses with appendages,

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:90%
had a huge head, large eyes.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were swimming through
this ocean underground.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Now there was two vents
that the remote viewers

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
saw that water or
some kind of spray

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
was being shot out of the
ocean onto the surface.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
What he tried to concentrate
on was how many other objects

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.400 align:middle line:84%
he could remote view
under the ocean.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was very, very
involved in this.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
actually upset him to the point

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:84%
where he was getting
psychologically unstable so

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:90%
to speak.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:84%
He had to stop
several times, but he

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:84%
didn't see any other swimming
creatures under there,

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:90%
but he saw these octopuses.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it amazed him that
there was living life

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:90%
under this moon of Jupiter.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And then what was troubling was
towards the end of the session,

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
he started talking about some
kind of a spacecraft that

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:90%
was coming in to Europa.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It was getting
closer and closer.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to determine
if he could look at it

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:90%
and remote view this craft.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But as it got closer and
closer to the planet,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
he lost his remote
viewing capability

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:90%
and that session ended.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It was really, really,
really remarkable.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's very compelling.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But at least for now we know
where octopuses come from.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I'm
thinking now at.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I totally think that.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is in the '90s.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And now there's been
so many analysis

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:84%
of octopuses by
marine biologists that

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
claim that these are very
intelligent creatures.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Their DNA and so forth,
they can't connect it

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:90%
to anything else on Earth.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:90%
So where did they come from?

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, we might know now.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Now we might know.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Did any of the other remote
viewers target Europa?

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what did they find?

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> They had three other
occasions where they remote

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.270 align:middle line:90%
viewed Europa.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't there during
the time period.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I was only there
during the first one.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But I heard from other
witnesses to the remote viewing

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to
go deeper, and deeper,

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and deeper into the
ocean to see if they

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:90%
could find anything else.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And they found large
worm-like creatures

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:90%
swimming around the ocean.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recall exactly
how they described them,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
but they were bigger than
the Europan octopuses.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were probably
similar to eels that

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.312 align:middle line:90%
were found deeper in the ocean.

00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know how
large these eels were?

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> They were several--

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
talking about meters,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
like 20 or 30 meters long, which
is like 60 feet or something

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And they also remote viewed
the top, the soil area,

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether there were
any structures or anything up

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.260 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were constantly
devoting their attention

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:84%
to this one area which there
seemed to be a platform there,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a platform,
a constructed platform,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:90%
like a man-made platform.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Although they didn't
see any flying crafts

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
coming into that
platform, but that might

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:84%
have been the platform the
first remote viewer, when

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
he was remote viewing it, the
craft, the disk-shaped craft

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:84%
that was coming in that
was distracting him,

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:90%
it might have landed there.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
I didn't witness

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:90%
any of these other three.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:84%
This is just information that
I obtained from the ones that

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:90%
witnessed it.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What was understood about
the information found here?

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The information was it was
a off-the-record, so to speak,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing sessions, that
these remote viewers wanted

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:90%
to demonstrate their abilities.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
it was being used.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I have no information
all that it

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
was being used by an
intelligence service

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
or by NSA, or NASA, or
the Institute itself.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it was just
a off-the-record type

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:90%
of sessions.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And I saw many of
other ones there

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
that had nothing
to do with UFOs,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that they were
testing themselves

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
in remote viewing another
location miles away

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I--

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And these were the top
remote viewers at the time?

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well they were.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
They were all
retired in the '90s.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But at the time
in the '80s, they

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.100 align:middle line:84%
were the top of
the line military.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I only saw the
military remote viewers.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
There were some civilians
that would come and go,

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
but I never saw
them remote view.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well at least
allegedly, they saw water.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.470 align:middle line:90%
They saw life, these octopuses.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
They saw the worms.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of them saw
a craft approaching.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty phenomenal
right there in itself.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It was an astounding opportunity
to see a remote viewing

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
For me, I'd heard
a lot about it,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and it was very,
very exciting for me

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to watch, and listen,
and then listen

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to him afterwards explain
what he did in the sketches

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:90%
that he drew.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now has this team ever tried
to remote view deeper in space

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and see anything?

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes this was a very, very
sensitive remote viewing

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
session that we did a couple
of years later where we knew--

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
the Institute, not me

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.120 align:middle line:84%
in particular-- but
we knew that there

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of space
craft in deep space.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
We knew, even in the '90s, we
had deep space probes in space.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were listening,
listening satellites,

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:90%
and photographing satellites.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They could do both, but
they were in deep space.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And we had one that took
a picture of an object

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
around the orbit of Neptune,
which would be very deep space.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So they thought there
was an opportunity

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
to try to remote view this
to determine whether it was

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:84%
an asteroid, a
comet, or whether it

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
was a flying device,
such as a maybe ET craft.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> How big on the
picture did they--

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
what was the numbers they
came up with of the size?

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a
massive-sized craft.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Miles long?

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thousands of feet long--

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --and wide.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
actual dimensions,

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:84%
but they were referring
to it as very large.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:90%
It took them a long time.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean there were
several sessions.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:90%
As you know, they concentrate.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:84%
They can't concentrate
on one particular area.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
It was several sessions that
it lasted hours and hours

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:84%
before they actually
were able to concentrate

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:90%
and remote view this craft.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
out, it was an ET craft.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they know anything about
the craft or the ETs that are

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:90%
controlling it?

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There were numerous of
entities inside this craft

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:90%
sitting at consoles.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
He could only view the top
part of these entities.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:90%
He could see their arms.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:90%
He could see their bodies.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.290 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't see their legs.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:84%
It is as if their bodies
might be in some other type

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:90%
of container or something else.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But there were many of them,
probably 40, 50, 60 of them

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:90%
at consoles within this craft.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Now consoles had portals
or windows on the top.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
It was cigar-shaped, long.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:90%
It had bulges at each end.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:84%
One end had had
these containers,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
which he described
as one container had

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:90%
rocks inside of it.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So scientists kind of figured
that probably is a propulsion

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:84%
system of some sort using
maybe some kind of material

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:90%
or elements.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:49.080 align:middle line:84%
The other end of the craft
had larger extraterrestrials,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
very, very tall and
very, very large arms.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.147 align:middle line:84%
And they were maybe in
control of the craft.

00:25:57.147 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:90%
There's something to that.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
They had a console
in front of them.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were manipulating
controls on that console.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:90%
He could see that.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The seats that these ETs were
sitting in were solid seats.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And they had some kind
of a structure or a bar

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
that ran from the
top of the seat

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the
ceiling of the craft.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
These entities had appeared
to be helmets on with bulges

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:90%
on the side.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't see the
face, but there was something

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
in front of their face,
probably some kind of a visor.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But what excited
him was the fact

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:84%
that every one of these
entities were doing something

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
at a small console, manipulating
it, or maybe flying the craft,

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they were
doing, collecting material.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
He did witness
something at the far--

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
where he thought the
propulsion system

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
was, some kind of beam or
something coming into the craft

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:84%
as if maybe they were
able to collect dust,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
solar dust or something, which
really kind of excited him.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:90%
But this craft was moving.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
He determined it to be
moving, not at a great speed,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:90%
more like an orbit.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And he could see Neptune.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
He distinctly can remember
and talk about Neptune.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:84%
He didn't actually
remote view Neptune,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.180 align:middle line:84%
but he could see it as a gas
giant, I mean the gas planet.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
everybody asked him was

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.010 align:middle line:84%
was there any other
crafts out there?

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't see anything
other than this long, huge,

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:90%
possibly a mother ship.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> How is this information
that you gathered used

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:90%
by the Institute?

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:84%
What did they do
with all of this?

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I know they collected it.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was supposed to
be off-the-record so to speak,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:84%
although there were some
representatives there from--

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:90%
one representative from NASA.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was the only
government that I knew,

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:84%
government person that was
present to witnesses this.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There were other
people in the room,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
but I believe they
were from other labs

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know who they were
or what their positions were.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
What they did with
it was proprietary

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I guess, whatever
they decided to do

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and whether they shared
it with NASA or NSA.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.775 align:middle line:84%
Since there was a
NASA person there,

00:28:36.775 --> 00:28:39.010 align:middle line:84%
a scientist, I'm
sure it went to NASA.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they probably
directed more satellite

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.350 align:middle line:84%
coverage to that particular
area trying to track this craft

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and determine what it
was, why it was there.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard rumors
that they were trying

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:90%
to get one of the Voyager--

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
because this in the '90s, and
Voyagers were still out there--

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to get the Voyager
to get close to it,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
but I don't believe that Voyager
had enough energy or power

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> How significant do you
feel remote viewing is

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:90%
for the intelligence agencies?

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a very,
very important tool within

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence community and
within the military in general.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.395 align:middle line:90%
I knew that back in the '80s.

00:29:20.395 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:84%
A brigadier general
was kidnapped in Italy.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The way they discovered
him was a remote viewer.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
They found out
exactly where he was

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
in that particular apartment.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Italian commandos went
in there and freed him.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know some other
situations where

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:84%
they were looking for
a kidnapped person

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.770 align:middle line:90%
inside the Soviet Union.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
He was kidnapped from
a particular place.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:90%
He had nonofficial cover.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
know where he was.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewers tracked
him exactly to that location,

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:90%
and he was able to be freed.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
good use of remote viewers

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.730 align:middle line:90%
back in the '70s and '80s.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they're
still active today.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know of some agencies
that have research and advanced

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:90%
research in remote viewing.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know you know more
about this than I do.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you that
they're still doing it.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's still going on.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're putting a
lot of money into it.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And it is definitely something
that governments do believe in

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
because it is very successful,
as you have experienced.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>> One added thing I'd like to
bring up is in the late '80s, I

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:84%
was at DIA headquarters
at Bolling Air Force Base.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a pretty secretive
area walking through a hallway.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the hallway,
there was a security guard.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't seen a
security guard around.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
what's down there?

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And the person that was leading
me around was named Carl.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, they're
having a remote viewing

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:90%
class down there.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Now this was 1988.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.637 align:middle line:84%
So they're still teaching
remote viewing in 1988.

00:31:02.637 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:90%
They're still teaching it today.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, Rick, thank you for
being on the show again.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I love talking
about remote viewing.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to
hear your experiences.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:84%
