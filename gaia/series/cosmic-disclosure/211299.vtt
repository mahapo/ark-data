>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:10%
a retired special agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:10%
Today we're talking about a UFO
and a nuclear weapons incident.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.237 align:middle line:10%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.237 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.015 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

>> What is Coyote Canyon?

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And what actually happened
in September of 1980?

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Coyote Canyon is a area
on the eastern side of Kirtland

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Air Force Base.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
It houses a test range, both
classified and unclassified

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
test range, and also,
during that time period,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
housed the largest
nuclear weapons

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
storage area in the world.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:90%
It was called Manzano Base.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '50s and early
'60s, the United States military

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and the Atomic Energy
Commission built structures

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
inside that mountain
to manufacture

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
nuclear weapons, both the
fission weapon and the fusion

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
All fission and fusion weapons
during that time period,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
actually from the late '40s
all the way up to the '70s,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
were manufactured
inside Manzano Base,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
they housed them

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
after they were put together.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Before the manufacturing process
moved to Pantex in Texas,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:90%
everything was done at Manzano.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But in 1980, Coyote Canyon
was a classified testing area.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Manzano Base
was located in that area.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Which brings us to
the next question,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.595 align:middle line:84%
who was involved of this
investigation of this event?

00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> How it started was security
police guarded Manzano Base.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
They had perimeter
guards all over the base.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I think each shift had
something like 70 to 80 security

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
policemen guarding
inside Manzano.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Plus, there's alarm structures
all over Manzano Base.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Pressure sensors, six
different fences with very high

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
voltage, and some
amazingly mean K-9 units.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And the K-9s patrolled within
a certain area of the fence.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, the entire
second layer of the fence

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:90%
was electrified.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.905 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to
the original story,

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:84%
a security police were
on duty one night,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and he saw this light
moving into the Canyon.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:10%
And it kept moving
around inside the Canyon

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:10%
area, which would have
been east of them,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:10%
the east side of Manzano.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
When the security policeman
observed this light

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
moving in and out
of the Canyon area,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
he immediately notified
their supervisor,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
who notified central
security control.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Central security control
controlled the security police

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
The supervisor asked CSC
to contact Sandia National

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Laboratories, because Sandia
had some bunkers in that area,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
which would have
been outside Manzano,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and asked Sandia's
control center to contact

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
their security forces,
which patrols that area,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and determine whether they saw
what the security police were

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:90%
seeing.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:10%
Sandia National Laboratories
was on Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '80s, they had,
I think, 80 buildings all

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
over the eastern
side of the base,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:90%
including in Coyote Canyon.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They had classified storage
areas and plus classified

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:90%
testing areas.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And what Sandia did--

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
a side note-- is they
tested nuclear weapons

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
out there, non-nuclear
testing of nuclear weapons,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:84%
dropping them from a distance,
testing the outer structures

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
of them, testing the
components, whether they

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
would break if they were
dropped from some distance.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So that testing was done
out in Coyote Canyon,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it was called
a classified testing area.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And not only did
Sandia test out there,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
but Los Alamos also
had a testing site

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
out there along with the Air
Force weapons laboratory, which

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:90%
at that time was on Kirtland.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
National Security Agency

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
had a highly
classified location,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
which was built into
a mountain out there.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:10%
And this isn't
classified anymore.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:10%
But they were doing laser
testing inside this mountain.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:10%
The mountain, I
think, was something

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:10%
like a half a mile long inside.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:10%
I believe you might
know more about that.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, the security
policemen continued watching

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:90%
this light moving in and out.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Sandia security control told
central security control

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.838 align:middle line:84%
that they had a security
guard in the area,

00:04:49.838 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and he was going to
check things out.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So we jumped to
the security guard.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Sandia National security have
their own security force.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a large force, almost
exclusively retired military,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
either retired
military policemen,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
retired military infantry
people, or even special forces,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:90%
almost all of them.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And different specialties
training as well,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:90%
compared to the regular MP, SP.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:90%
And they were highly trained.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
They had to go through
an extensive program.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:10%
They weren't just a security
guard you hire off the street.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They had to go through--
because they were controlling

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and guarding restricted
data areas, which

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:90%
meant nuclear materials.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not necessarily
nuclear weapons,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
but materials that went
inside the nuclear weapons.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
They had nuclear pit
storage areas out there.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
They had nuclear component areas
that were stored out there.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So this particular bunker
that this incident happened in

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:90%
had some nuclear material in it.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it was an
experimental bunker.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The way the bunkers
before was built,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:84%
it's a huge concrete bunker,
blast doors on the front.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And they would store the
nuclear weapons inside.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
This particular bunker, the
way they did it was they

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
had a platform inside
with an elevator

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:90%
that went down 60 feet.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So they'd put the nuclear
weapon on this platform

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and then dropped it down
60 feet under this bunker.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So if a terrorist was to
penetrate this bunker,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapon wasn't there.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.530 align:middle line:90%
It was 60 feet underground.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So at this particular
time, 1980,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
they had, nuclear material
stored in that bunker.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:90%
So it was alarmed.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
As this one Sandia security
guard was patrolling out there,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:90%
he saw this light too.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed him
extensively later.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And he saw this light,
and he watched it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, well, it
has to be a helicopter.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Because the 1550th air
crew test and training

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:10%
wing, which was
an Air Force unit,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:10%
also conducted
training out there

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:10%
of different types
of helicopters,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:10%
Jolly Green Giant helicopters,
HH-53 helicopters, H-1s.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't notified
that there was going

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:90%
to be any testing out there.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And this was late at night.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.023 align:middle line:84%
So he watched this
light from a distance.

00:07:16.023 --> 00:07:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And he hadn't approached
the bunker yet.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:84%
He was some distance
from the bunker.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
He was patrolling
other areas out there.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden
he sees this light.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And as it got
lower and lower, he

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
realized there was a
shape to the light.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was a flying
saucer, as he described

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:90%
it, a round-shaped disk.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And it landed directly in
front of this alarm area.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would a extraterrestrial
be interested in any nuclear

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.566 align:middle line:90%
or biostorage units?

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, probably
for a lot of reasons.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So the security
guard approached.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:90%
He drove up.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:90%
He's in a pickup truck.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:90%
He drives up and parks.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, a little background
on the security guard--

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:84%
he was retired from
the United States Army.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:90%
He was a Vietnam veteran.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:90%
This is 1980.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:90%
So he had been in Vietnam.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
He was a door gunner
on a helicopter,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and then he was also a ground
soldier, just infantry.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he got out and been
with Sandia for 10 or 11 years.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.825 align:middle line:84%
>> So he knew
aircraft very well.

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> He knew aircraft very well
and he knew helicopters very

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:84%
well because he flew
in them in Vietnam.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So he saw this, and he
realized it's not a helicopter.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
He thought, well, maybe
it's an experimental craft

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:84%
that somebody, somebody
that's using this test range

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
is flying, and maybe
it accidentally landed.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was trouble.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.867 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was supposed to land
in another area, test range.

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, there's
thousands of acres

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:90%
of the test range out there.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:90%
It isn't that--

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.595 align:middle line:90%
>> It's enormous.

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:49.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So he's trying to
call on a radio,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and his radio doesn't work.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing but static jam.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a
sudden, the engine

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
shuts off on his pickup truck.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So then he had a
shotgun and a handgun.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So he got his shotgun out,
and he got out of his vehicle.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And he just watched.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.138 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what this
thing was going to do.

00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
He still thought, all the
time during this time period,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.045 align:middle line:84%
he still thought it was
some experimental craft.

00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it Sandia security or
Kirtland Air Force security?

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.075 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Sandia security.

00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And he couldn't do
anything because he had no

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.475 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:25.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
He had no communications, no way
of notifying his command center

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.935 align:middle line:90%
or anyone else.

00:09:30.935 --> 00:09:31.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> He used tactics.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
He moved away from
the pickup truck.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
He thought, well, OK, if
this isn't an Air Force test

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
vehicle, if it's an
extraterrestrial or maybe

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
a Soviet, they're going to try
to destroy my vehicle first.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So he moves away from
that, and there's

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
another utility building
some distance away from him

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:90%
that housed--

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
it was a water pump and a
building, a concrete building.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So he ran over to
that and stood there.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
bottom of this flying saucer

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:90%
opened up.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, it was just
like an egg that opened,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and the stairs came down.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, these two
entities came down.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:90%
He said, they floated.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.660 align:middle line:90%
They didn't walk.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized,
this is not conventional,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:90%
and this is not terrestrial.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be extraterrestrial.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Because he's looking
at these two entities

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:90%
that are very small.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, probably 4
foot, with huge heads.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Or he thought, first,
they were heads,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
but as they started
getting closer to him,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:90%
he realized they were helmets.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And they had a breathing
apparatus that ran around

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:90%
to tanks on its back.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:84%
They had these strange-looking
hands, either that,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
or he thought maybe
they were gloves

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.765 align:middle line:90%
that rotated 360 degrees.

00:10:58.765 --> 00:10:59.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And then he thought,
as they moved towards him,

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.807 align:middle line:84%
his first thought
was they were robots.

00:11:04.807 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, the first thing
I thought of, was "Lost

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:84%
in Space," that robot in "Lost
in Space," where they could--

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
he thought, well--
then, he started

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
thinking, OK, if
they're robots, maybe

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
it is an Air Force project.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're using
robots as pilots.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, he must have been
very close to get such detailed

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:10%
information by looking.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, was he--

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.295 align:middle line:90%
>> He was about 200 feet.

00:11:28.295 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> 200 feet, OK.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%
That's close.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.882 align:middle line:84%
>> But the two entities
were moving towards him.

00:11:32.882 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:90%
They knew he was there.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even though
he was hiding,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:84%
they knew he was there
somehow because they

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:90%
kept moving towards him.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.342 align:middle line:84%
So he realized, well, I
have to defend myself.

00:11:44.342 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I have to defend what--

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:90%
I have to do my job.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So he chambered a
round in his shotgun,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and it was an 870 Remington,
a 12-gauge shotgun.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And he had four
slugs in the shotgun.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:10%
So he pointed it at
the two entities,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:10%
and he yelled, stop,
halt. I'm security.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:10%
They did.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:10%
They stopped.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:10%
And they seemed more
concerned with that pickup.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:90%
One of them, then--

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:90%
he said, floating.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
They didn't walk-- over
towards his pickup.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't approach
him any farther.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they far off the ground
or just even with the ground

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:90%
almost with their feet?

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
You said, they levitated
towards his vehicle.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>> He said floated.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were maybe a foot off
the ground, I think, he said.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, he didn't feel a threat
any longer because the entity

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:90%
wasn't moving towards him.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.407 align:middle line:84%
He was concerned that
what they were going

00:12:40.407 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:90%
to do to the pickup truck.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Although, it's the Sandia
National Laboratories pickup.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
He just thought,
well, what are they

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:90%
going to do with this pickup?

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But the other end, you
went over, and kind of

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:90%
moved around it.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't really see
everything it was doing.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:10%
But the other one kept
watching its partner.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the
other one turned around.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:90%
And he turned around--

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is why
the security guard

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:90%
kept thinking it was a robot.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It turned around
mechanically, not

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
like a human would do, and
moved back towards the craft.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But as it got towards the craft,
it veered more to the right

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and went right to the
front of the bunker.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, he realized, I
have to do something

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because I'm responsible
for protecting this,

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:90%
so I got to do something.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Even though I can't
radio anybody,

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I can't radio a supervisor.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't radio for assistance.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.798 align:middle line:84%
And he kept reiterating to
me during the interviews,

00:13:40.798 --> 00:13:42.090 align:middle line:90%
you know, I've been in Vietnam.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:90%
I've been in tight situations.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
I've been in combat.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:84%
This is entirely
different, he said.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
This is something that, I'm
dealing with unknowns here.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:10%
In Vietnam, I was dealing
with enemy soldiers.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Here, I don't know
what these things are.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
If they're robots,
can I harm him?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Can I shoot him?

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing he know,
the bunker doors are open.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it
happened in a flash.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:10%
He said, normally,
it would take--

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:10%
actually, these bunkers, it
would take a time period.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It can go from seven
minutes up to 15 minutes.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you start
to open these doors.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, he knew this, and
he knew the procedures.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
this door opened,

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:84%
the two heavy
metal doors opened.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:90%
And so, then he started moving.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
He moved around
his pickup truck.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
He lost track of
the second entity.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.457 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know where it was.

00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't at the
pickup because he

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:84%
moved around the pickup, and
he moved towards the bunker.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
As he moved towards the
bunker, he started shaking.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
His body started shaking
as if his legs weighed

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:90%
a thousand pounds each.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:90%
He dropped the shotgun.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't hold it.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.137 align:middle line:84%
He realized, now,
I'm in trouble.

00:14:54.137 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're doing to me.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm in trouble.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:90%
So he was just frozen there.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And he watched them
go in, both of them,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:90%
but he couldn't do anything.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, they were
only in there for,

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
he said, just maybe
10 or 15 seconds.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And they came out.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And when they came out, they
moved to the spaceship--

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:90%
to the flying saucer.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%
He called it a spaceship.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And the doors closed on its
own, which is not possible,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:90%
he thought.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But once they got to the
craft, he could relax.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:84%
He immediately
picked up a shotgun.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And by the time he got himself
in order, the craft took off.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:84%
He went back to
his pickup truck.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:10%
It took off, but it
hovered above the ground,

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:10%
somewhere away from
the pickup truck.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But as the engine
came back on, and he

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:90%
was able to use the radio.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And as he started hearing a
radio, they were calling him.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:10%
They were trying to call him and
giving him a security status.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I have a
major problem out here.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't say
he was in trouble.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:84%
He just said, I have a
major problem out here,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:90%
and I need a supervisor.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.750 align:middle line:90%
And I need another patrol.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said, other
units are responding.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they
sent what they would

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
consider their assault
team or a six-man,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:90%
called quick reaction team.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
They were already
responding, including

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:90%
some of the security policemen.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They called them security
alert team from Manzano

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
was going out there
to try to help.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:10%
And from Manzano
base to this bunker

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:10%
is probably 3 and
1/2 miles or so.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the
calvary showed up,

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't know what
to tell anybody.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to believe?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.562 align:middle line:84%
So when they took him
back-- they relieved him,

00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and he took him
back to the office.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And he tells the story
to his supervisor.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the security
supervisors is Russell Douglas

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:90%
was his name.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And Russ listened
to him intently

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and immediately notified OSI.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was the on-call
agent that night.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was like
4:00 in the morning.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:10%
By the time everything.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:90%
So they called me.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:90%
They said, we got a situation.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So I went out to
Sandia Security Office,

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:90%
and the guard was there.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And Russ told me what happened.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, is
he hurt, injured?

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
He said, he's been checked
by one of our medics.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:84%
He didn't seem to be
injured in any way.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
He's a little concerned about
what happened, and I said,

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:90%
what about radiation?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we didn't
check him for that.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we should.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, I think we should.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, they got
people in to do that.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked in,
and I identified myself.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I just want
to know what happened.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:90%
And he told me.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the story
I just told you.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:90%
He told me the story.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did you
fire your shotgun at it?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:90%
No, I couldn't.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I would have.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I probably should have
stayed back farther

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
because, as I got
closer, I was frozen.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they did it.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, did you black out?

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:90%
No, no, I never blacked out.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:90%
He said, I just was frozen.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It was like, my body
weighed thousands of pounds.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I said, did they come
over to you, touch you?

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:10%
>> And he's been through a war,
so he wouldn't just freeze up

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:10%
because of fear.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It must've been some
energetic field,

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.895 align:middle line:90%
if you want to talk about that.

00:18:32.895 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what we--

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.045 align:middle line:84%
now, this went on,
this investigation

00:18:37.045 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:90%
went for a long time.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the teams
that got there went in

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
to check on the material
that's inside that bunker.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And as they brought this
stuff up, it's missing.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.220 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So they stole-- it
wasn't a nuclear weapon.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It was nuclear
material for a weapon,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:84%
but it was safeguarded,
like a nuclear weapon.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, it was missing.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, while I was in
this interview with him,

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Russ comes to the door, and
he motions for me to come out.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And I go out, and he said, the
material inside that bunker

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:90%
is missing.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.458 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't know what
was in at that time.

00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, what is it?

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Nuclear weapon?

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, it's
nuclear material.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.895 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can tell you.

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a list of it.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:90%
It's classified.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, I need to--

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Show it.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So he gives me a list of the
things that were in there.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
package of materials

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
that they could take out and
put it in a nuclear weapon

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to make it function.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the nuclear material.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:90%
It was components.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
They call them MC,
military components.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:90%
MC and there were numbers.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.945 align:middle line:90%
I said, all this classified?

00:19:50.945 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, highly classified.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what could
somebody do with it?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if they got
the nuclear material,

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
the fissionable material,
the uranium, or plutonium,

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.867 align:middle line:84%
or cobalt, they
could make a bomb.

00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now, I have to
start making phone calls

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and sending everything
up to headquarters

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and getting my supervisor
involved in it.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
In 1980, I'd been an OSI agent
for just a couple of years.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd been briefed in a lot
of different programs.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:90%
I knew about UFOs.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd been briefed in that
because of the Paul Bennewitz

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, I thought,
this is legitimate.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I went back in the
room, I asked security,

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:90%
you need water or something?

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, I'm good.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, do you believe me?

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I said, I believe you.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I believe you.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe you,
something happened.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you think maybe
they took this stuff,

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:10%
and then it was to prevent us
from utilizing it in a nuclear

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.632 align:middle line:10%
warhead?

00:20:46.632 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That thought crossed a number
of people's minds is that they

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
were trying to prevent
something from happening.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they didn't
understand everything

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:84%
about our nuclear weapons
or nuclear materials,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
so they were going to, maybe,
analyze it and determine

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
it could be used for war-making
or something like that,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
want that to happen.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
That's just a guess
on our part because we

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:90%
don't know how aliens think.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I told him, I said, the material
inside a bunker is missing.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.420 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm going to get fired.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, don't worry about
anything like that right now.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, you did your job.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:90%
He said, I tried.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:90%
They froze me.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.392 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I don't know
how I am going to prove that.

00:21:34.392 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Because people are going
to think I'm a coward,

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't try to shoot them.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
My responsibility is
guarding that material,

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't do that.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're not concerned
about that quite yet.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:84%
We're concerned about
material, where it went.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, it went in that
spacecraft in outer space.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
He gave me really a
detailed description,

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and he actually was
able to sketch what

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:90%
these entities looked like.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And what he sketched, I
wish I had them here now.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
They were all classified
in Washington.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But they look like
little space people

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.465 align:middle line:84%
that you would see
in space shows.

00:22:14.465 --> 00:22:15.803 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a pop culture type.

00:22:15.803 --> 00:22:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, like a pop culture.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:90%
They had helmets-- huge helmets.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, he didn't
know, if it was

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
because they needed
an environmental air

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
or something inside that, or
if their heads were that big.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't determine that.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Or if it was just a robot.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I confronted
him with this.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I said, you said that the
helmet was big with a tube.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and respirators
or something.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> He said, yeah.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, if it
was a robot, they

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't need to breathe air.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, oh,
yeah, that's right.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.877 align:middle line:90%
So they must have been real.

00:22:46.877 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
He says, it must have
been extraterrestrial.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I say, yeah, probably were.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that time
in my career, I

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been briefed in all
the different extraterrestrial

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:90%
races or anything like that.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:90%
So we continued.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
He gave us a description,
and that was it.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you go
home and get some sleep.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.485 align:middle line:84%
And we'll continue it
at some other time.

00:23:09.485 --> 00:23:11.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Was it happening at
any other facilities,

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:10%
any other bases
that we controlled?

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.375 align:middle line:90%
>> There were at the same time?

00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There were other cases that
happened during that same time

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting,
we were going

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to setup another interview
with the security guard.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And Russ called me and
said, can you come over?

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I got some additional
information.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
share on the phone.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So I drive over to his office,
and I said, what do you got?

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, another security guard,
same thing happened to him.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, when?

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It's about two
weeks ago, he said.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:90%
But he shot him.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:90%
He fired his shotgun at him.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, OK,
did he do a report?

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:90%
No, he's just told us this now.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:90%
He covered it up.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was a different bunker.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't the same bunker.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And it had nuclear
material in it.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:10%
As these two entities
got out, and he

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:10%
described in exactly the same
way as the other security guard

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:10%
did.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:90%
He fired a shotgun.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Four slugs he had.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
slugs in the shotgun.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:90%
He fired all four at him.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And the bullets
just-- the slugs.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:90%
They were shotgun slugs.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.580 align:middle line:84%
They just seemed to dissipate,
as they never hit him.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:90%
They just kind of dissipate.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But it got their
attention to a point

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:84%
where it pulled the shotgun
away from his hands,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:90%
and it fell on the ground.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And then he backed up,
they went into this bunker,

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:84%
came back out, did the same
exact thing, and flew away.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, he went over
and got the shotgun,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and he replaced the
slugs with his own slugs

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.032 align:middle line:90%
and never reported it.

00:24:58.032 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Did they go out and
do another investigation

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:10%
of the area and find anything?

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:90%
We went out there.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:90%
But this was several weeks--

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> --before, so there wasn't
any evidence out there.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:90%
But he had it in a bag.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:10%
He had the spent shotgun shells
in the bag that he gave to me.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, those are the ones that
were the Sandia issued to me.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And I put mine.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm going to
get fired for it,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
but I know so-and-so,
the other security guard,

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and I want to report that
it happened to me, too.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.472 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why
didn't you report it?

00:25:27.472 --> 00:25:29.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was scared
to death to report.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to believe me.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.872 align:middle line:84%
He said, plus, I shot my
shotgun, and nothing happened.

00:25:35.872 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
where those slugs went.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:90%
We can't find them.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I went over and
looked around it.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It maybe just absorbed
into the bodies.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, he never described
them as robots.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:84%
He described them as real
creatures or real entities.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he also said,
he heard them speaking.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
They were speaking
like they were

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:84%
yelling at each other,
high-pitched voices, back

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:90%
and forth.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:02.915 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other guard never
never heard any kind of voices.

00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:04.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he recognize
that language?

00:26:04.527 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:90%
He said, it was just screaming.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
what he told me.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But there were different
pitches from one to the other.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So he realized, one had a
different pitch in its voice

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:90%
than the other.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:90%
But he could hear it.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And as if they
were communicating

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever they were doing.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Wasn't there other witnesses
that you said earlier,

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.560 align:middle line:84%
who was called in
on the first one.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.785 align:middle line:10%
Was there any witnesses
on the second one?

00:26:33.785 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The incident
happened, I think,

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:10%
it was four weeks earlier.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Security police at Manzano saw
another light coming to Canyon,

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:90%
but never reported it.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know what it was, thought
it was just a helicopter.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed those
security policemen later.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, we've
seen a lot of lights

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:90%
out there, a lot of helicopters.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:84%
There's training out
there all the time.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
The Pararescue school, Air
Force Pararescue school,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:90%
they do training out there.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:90%
We don't think anything of it.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
We saw it that particular
night, which we identified

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:90%
from the second security guard.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And plus, they have,
on top of the mountain,

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.770 align:middle line:84%
they have a camera,
a long-range--

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:20.510 align:middle line:84%
it's called a long-range
scanner camera.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But it only records things
for a 24-hour period.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:10%
So you can't go back and look
beyond the 24-- it erases it.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It only has a--

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:84%
this is 1980 technology, so
they didn't have the hard drives

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:90%
that could store any.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
However, when I first
learned about it--

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't, but our tech technical
people knew about the camera.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So the first incident
that we investigated,

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:90%
we got the footage on that.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:90%
We got the footage.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:84%
However, the camera only
goes in one direction.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't point down.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.765 align:middle line:84%
So all you see is this
thing coming in and land,

00:28:00.765 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see anything else
that's happening in the ground.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.687 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a fixed horizon.

00:28:04.687 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But what they did
was, they took frames,

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and they actually were able
to look at, and identify,

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and take a frame picture of
that saucer-shaped craft.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And when it went
up to headquarters,

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:90%
they identified it.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Although, I never
was told because,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
at the ground level, my level,
I didn't have a need to know.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:36.217 align:middle line:84%
But in headquarters knew
exactly what particular entity.

00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> So they knew what race.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:42.340 align:middle line:84%
They obviously seen this
craft before and compared it

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:90%
to, maybe, other incidences.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever find
out ever what it was?

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It took me some time.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.650 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, I
found out that it

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
was a craft flown by the Grays.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
But the identities of the
operators of the Grays' craft

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that have been seen and
witnessed and investigated

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:84%
a number of different occasions
around military installations

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
in the past, didn't
fit the entities

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:90%
that came out of the craft.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So they thought, maybe, they
were, in fact, some kind

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.175 align:middle line:90%
of robots or maybe hybrids.

00:29:16.175 --> 00:29:17.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Programmed life forms maybe.

00:29:17.735 --> 00:29:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Programmed life forms.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know any more
than that, about that.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But ironically, during that
same time period in 1980,

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
there were a number
of other incidents

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that happened at
military installations,

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.150 align:middle line:84%
missile sites around
the United States,

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same
thing, including

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:84%
one particular incident, which
is still highly classified,

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:84%
where they actually
took a nuclear weapon.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They took a W-28 a
warhead, and a W-28 warhead

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
was a one megaton
gravity-dropped bomb.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:84%
It was missing out of a storage
area at a strategic air command

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:90%
based in the United States.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.445 align:middle line:84%
So these things have
happened in the past.

00:30:07.445 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Are these security forces
briefed on extraterrestrial

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.630 align:middle line:10%
activity, and the beings, and
entities, and also the craft?

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they weren't until
all these incidents started

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, they
started being briefed.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:84%
They were given a
classified briefing

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:90%
on a need-to-know basis.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:84%
If they were guarding a
nuclear weapon storage

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
area or a missile site,
the security policemen

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.270 align:middle line:84%
operate in the field, the
missile fields, launch control

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:84%
facilities, these
security policemen

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:84%
were given a classified
briefing that they may encounter

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:84%
something unknown
an unknown aircraft,

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:52.010 align:middle line:84%
flying in with unknown entities
on board or they use creatures.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were to follow
these set procedures.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And there were set procedures,
but they were in a case,

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were only to be broken
open if they were responding

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:90%
to an incident like that.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And the procedures
were classified,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
but they were in
this case that they

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
would break open and pull out
if they actually ever responded.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And this came in the
late '70s and early '80s.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I know today, for a
fact, that they now

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
have specific protocols
for those individuals that

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
are guarding sensitive
materials of what

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to do in case of
the event of, I'll

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:84%
just say, as you said
earlier, they do still

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:37.010 align:middle line:84%
use those terms of creatures,
as they did in the early '80s,

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
if they were actually
approached or if they seen this.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:84%
We had a Lieutenant Colonel
Ronald Gray give a presentation

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:84%
at a UFO convention about
this a few years ago,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about what
the new procedures are now,

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.890 align:middle line:90%
compared to years ago.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:90%
They were never briefed.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they were never
able to function or know

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:03.200 align:middle line:84%
what to do if some
ET aircraft landed.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But now, as you
said, there are set

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.405 align:middle line:84%
procedures that are classified
of what to do, step-by-step.

00:32:09.405 --> 00:32:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you share with us on
any of these protocols from

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.477 align:middle line:90%
back then?

00:32:12.477 --> 00:32:13.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:13.277 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of the protocols-- and I
don't know every one of them,

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and I think there were
something like 10 or 12 of them.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:90%
And there were secondary ones.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.350 align:middle line:84%
If you do this, and that
doesn't work, you do this.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, the first one is, do
not fire at the craft nor fire

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.535 align:middle line:90%
at the creature or the entities.

00:32:32.535 --> 00:32:33.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:32:33.335 --> 00:32:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll use entities here, but
the words in this was creature.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, do not
approach the craft.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from the
craft, and never, never

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:90%
approach the entities.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Number three, immediately
notify central security control

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:84%
or launch control
facility dispatch.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was watch,
observe, and detect,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:84%
whether there's any other
crafts flying around.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.070 align:middle line:84%
If that's the only
one on the ground, OK.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But keep a lookout for any
other crafts flying in the area,

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe on a recon mission
or something like that.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And then one of them, I can
remember is, don't be fooled.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:10%
Don't be fooled by a possibility
that a Soviet or this could be

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:10%
a Soviet-staged
event or a hostile--

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.448 align:middle line:10%
I think it was a
hostile country event.

00:33:27.448 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And during that time
period, it would

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.532 align:middle line:84%
have been the Soviets
or the Chinese,

00:33:30.532 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:84%
but primarily, we were
concerned about the Russians.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And make sure it wasn't staged
by or it was an exercise.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Never shoot your
exercise opponents,

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:90%
something to that effect.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So those things, I can
remember that was on there.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, there were many others.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And as I understand,
there is even--

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:84%
if you had to shoot,
you had to shoot

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.170 align:middle line:84%
in a certain area the entity's
body and things like that.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I think one of them was,
if you had to engage,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.739 align:middle line:84%
you would shoot at any
environmental protection

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that this entity had, such as
breathing apparatus, disrupt

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
the breathing apparatus, or
some other environmental control

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
first rather than trying
to shoot into the body.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.936 align:middle line:90%
Disable the entity.

00:34:22.936 --> 00:34:23.769 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes sense.

00:34:23.769 --> 00:34:24.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.589 align:middle line:84%
Rick, do you think there was
a message in all of this?

00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:90%
There was a message.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, at
the time, I was

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.090 align:middle line:84%
in a position to determine
what that message was.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.845 align:middle line:84%
But there were supervisors
above me, many people above me.

00:34:38.845 --> 00:34:40.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Different opinions, probably.

00:34:40.675 --> 00:34:43.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Different opinions,
trying to figure out why.

00:34:43.935 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Why are they only targeting
nuclear weapons storage areas

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.150 align:middle line:84%
or nuclear weapon
complexes or missile silos?

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Now my personal opinion is,
what we talked about earlier.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:35:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that they don't know
everything about us, maybe,

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:84%
but they know that we
have this nuclear weapon.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:90%
They've seen it tested.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:10.600 align:middle line:84%
They probably watched testing
at the Nevada test site

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:84%
or saw what we were doing
underground at the Nevada test

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:90%
site after 1962.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think the
moratorium was in '62.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:90%
They went from above ground.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They probably were
in the Pacific,

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:26.140 align:middle line:84%
watching us detonate
nuclear weapons.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:90%
They knew they were harmful.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were concerned
about us as a society,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and they decided, OK,
let's steal this stuff

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.840 align:middle line:90%
and keep them from making more.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in reality, that
probably sounds pretty

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:84%
farfetched because we have so
many different nuclear weapons

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:84%
storage areas and not just
us, but the Soviet Union

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:90%
had thousands.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:84%
China had thousands,
even France,

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and Britain had thousands.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And what do we do?

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:84%
How do you handle
something like that.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Or how do you
determine, OK, what's

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.380 align:middle line:84%
our next course of
action because they're

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.660 align:middle line:90%
stealing our nuclear weapons?

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> With working with all the
scientists that you have worked

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.940 align:middle line:84%
with and everyone in
intelligence, do you believe,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:84%
in any way, that
maybe we're affecting

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials,
and their race,

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and their homes with
our nuclear activity.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I do, and they do.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to many scientists at
Sandia National Laboratories

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.170 align:middle line:90%
during this time period.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And their concern was that
maybe we, our country--

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
we were only talking
about the United States--

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:84%
during our thousands
of nuclear tests,

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:84%
have disrupted something that we
don't realize that we're doing,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:84%
something in the atmosphere,
something that's traveling away

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:84%
from Earth to their
planet, or something

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that they have
here on our planet

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying
to safeguard.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, that presents an entirely
another subject matter.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, for instance, if the
ETs have a base here,

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
whether it be under the ocean,
underground, in Antarctica,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.840 align:middle line:90%
or someplace.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And these nuclear weapons
testing that we're doing

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.020 align:middle line:84%
or we did then is
disrupting their home

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.665 align:middle line:84%
or disrupting their
base on planet Earth.

00:37:27.665 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, this was
a great episode.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I love doing this
interview with you

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.692 align:middle line:84%
because I was stationed
at Kirtland, as you know,

00:37:32.692 --> 00:37:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and it brings back
a lot of memories.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:35.805 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the show.

00:37:35.805 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Great to be here, Emery.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.135 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:38.135 --> 00:37:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:90%
