00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're with Richard Doty,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO ET

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:90%
related intelligence.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Today we are
discussing an incident

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:90%
at the air base in Germany.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.177 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Now most people have heard
of Ramstein Air Force Base

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.232 align:middle line:90%
in Germany.

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us a
little bit about what

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:90%
you were doing there?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was assigned to
OSI Europe at Wiesbaden,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
which is some distance
away from Ramstein.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But while I was
stationed in Europe

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:84%
in the counterintelligence
section there,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I learned of an incident that
happened in 1974 at Ramstein.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And this incident involved
a US army artillery

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
unit, air defense artillery
unit, that shot down a UFO.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And that happened
northeast of Ramstein.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
The air bases around Germany
were guarded by US army

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:90%
anti-air defense forces.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
The 30 second air
defense artillery force

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
was one of the units, and
they had different companies

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
around air bases protecting
them from enemy attack.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
This anti-aircraft
artillery unit

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
used Vulcan cannons
and Chaparral missiles.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
The Vulcan cannons were
housed on half track vehicles,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and they fired 6,000
rounds a minute.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And they could shoot
down low-flying aircraft.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
The Chaparral missiles
were a larger missile.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.133 align:middle line:84%
They were based away
from the Vulcan missile,

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and they were the
secondary defense unit

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
because they shot down
higher flying aircrafts.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
If the aircraft-- enemy aircraft
got through the Vulcan system,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:84%
the Chaparral missiles
would bring them down.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And these were
conventional warheads

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:90%
on the Chaparral missiles.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> How do they identify
it in the first place,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and how did they bring it down?

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, air defense artillery
systems operate their own

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's an ADOC, an Air
Defense Operation Center,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:84%
which was in Kindsbach,
a few miles away.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The ADOC controlled all
the radar sites around

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and all the air defense
artillery sites around Germany.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones that would
have picked something up,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
this UFO or what they designated
later as a bogey on radar.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And they use bogey, and they
use a designation of a bogey,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:90%
bogey one, two as a designator.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So all the units had one word
and one designation in common.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
This enemy, suspected enemy
aircraft, that's coming in

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
was designated bogey
one, which was then

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%
considered a hostile aircraft.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> What's a bogey two?

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>> A bogey two is another craft,
another enemy craft coming in.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.788 align:middle line:90%
So bogey one would be one craft.

00:03:13.788 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
If there's two crafts
coming in, it'd

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:90%
be a bogey one, a bogey two.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we know if it's
a UFO or if it's a passenger

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:84%
airliner compared to
a military aircraft?

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> They use a system called
Identification Friend, Foe,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:90%
or Neutral, IFFN, OK?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Once they identify the
craft as a non-hostile,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
such as a neutral
craft, they give it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
a designator of a friendly
craft, such as an airliner.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
A bogey is only used when
it's a hostile aircraft.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did the Air Force
fire upon this UFO,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and what did they
use to fire upon it?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, the craft came in.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:90%
It was recorded on radar.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
It was coming in
towards the air base.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
The lieutenant that was in
charge of the missile battery

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
immediately contacted the
ADOC, the Air Defense Operation

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Center, asking permission
to fire upon it.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:84%
They had to get special
permission to do that.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to identify it.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Several other
military units, one

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
being a comm unit, the
109th communications unit,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
which was-- is always in the
same area with an air defense

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:90%
artillery site.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to voice
communicate with this craft

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%
in different languages.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
They were using Russian,
I think, English, German,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not sure what other.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:90%
You're flying towards a base.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:90%
You're restricted air zone.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Deviate from your flight path.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.533 align:middle line:84%
They only wanted to
fire as a last resort.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
shoot down something

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:90%
that could be a friendly.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, they went through all
the communication systems,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
but the craft was still
coming towards the air base.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And when ADOC
eventually-- and they

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
had to get the commander of
the US Air Force or US Army

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
in Europe's permission
to fire upon it.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.165 align:middle line:90%
They got it.

00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And when they told
the missile battery,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and fire
on it, the craft

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
disappeared, only to reappear
at a different location

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.057 align:middle line:90%
several minutes later.

00:05:16.057 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Now they still-- they
already had permission

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:90%
to fire up on it, so they did.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
The lieutenant in charge
of the missile battery

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:90%
told his Vulcan unit, fire.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So the Vulcan unit
fired upon this craft.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
As it approached, the bullets
from the 20 millimeter

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
rounds from the
Vulcan cannon hit,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't bring it down.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
It kept on going south towards
the air base, at which time

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
the lieutenant gave the orders
for the Chaparral battery

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
to fire up on the craft.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So the two Chaparral
missiles fired,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
but both detonated
prior to hitting it.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:90%
The craft kept coming.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a second Vulcan
unit, what they call

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:90%
the last zone of defense unit.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
They fired and they
were very close to it.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:90%
That disabled the craft.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The craft started making
strange maneuvers in the air.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
As it got close to the
ground, they fired at one--

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
only one Chaparral
missile, which

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
hit the craft and
the craft crashed.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any threatening
provocation that inspired them

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
to do this, or is it just
because they're entering

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:90%
our space?

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they were flying
directly towards Ramstein Air

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Ramstein Air Base
at that time in 1974

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
was the command
for all Air Force

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
bases in Europe, not just in
Germany but all of Europe.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
important base, had

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons on that base.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so this air
defense artillery,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
their mission is to
protect that air base.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Also on that base was
the 86 fighter squadron,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:90%
which contained fighter jets.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But that anti-aircraft
batteries were there

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to protect that base, and
that's why they fired upon it.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did the UFO go down,
and how long did it take them

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:90%
to get there?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The UFO crashed
in a field west,

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:90%
some miles west of Ramstein.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> But not on the base?

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Not on the base.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:90%
It was off the base.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
German police responded,
and they got there first.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The German police had an
Air Force security police

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:84%
translator with him who was
communicating back to the base.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And when German
police got there,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.472 align:middle line:84%
the area around the
craft was on fire.

00:07:37.472 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So they called the
German fire department

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:84%
to respond, extinguish
the fire, and now they

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:84%
have this craft that's
sitting on the ground.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing what it
is, the lieutenant

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the anti-aircraft
battery arrived at scene.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
He notified his
superiors that this craft

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
was ellipsoid in shape,
big craft, heavy metal.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.083 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't identify it.

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
trained in that,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
so if it was some
Russian craft or an East

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
German or a Czech craft,
they could identify it.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't anything
they'd ever seen before,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
so immediately they
considered it a hostile craft.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So they set up a perimeter
around the craft.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, a 55 man infantry
unit from Kaiserslautern,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
which was a short distance
away, responded and set up

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:90%
a perimeter around it.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.525 align:middle line:84%
They brought in anti-aircraft
guns to shoot on this craft

00:08:30.525 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:90%
if it was going to leave.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:84%
They also brought in an EOD
unit from Kapaun barracks,

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
because number one,
they thought it

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:84%
might be some kind of a nuclear
weapon or some weapon system.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
The EOD unit got there, and
this was early morning hours

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of, I think, May 24th
of 1974, and they

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
were able to actually
open the bottom part

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:90%
of the craft, the hatch.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And once the hatch was
open, the EOD personnel

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
had to dress in protective
personnel equipment.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And they used
anti-radiation suits

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
know what this was.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
They immediately determined
there wasn't any radiation.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But when the two
EOD techs went in,

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
they found four dead bodies
in council, sitting in seats.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And when other emergency
response personnel, disaster

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
preparedness personnel,
they call, got to the scene,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
they went in and took
these bodies out.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
They immediately determined
them not to be humans.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They were some kind
of extraterrestrial,

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:90%
they believed.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
The EOD personnel couldn't
figure out what this was.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Probably determined it wasn't
any kind of nuclear weapon

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of weapon.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:90%
It was probably a flying craft.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, they shot it down.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Then now they they're
stuck with this craft

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
on the ground with four
dead extraterrestrials,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:90%
and what to do from there?

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>> And how large was the craft?

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The craft was quite
large, 30 foot in diameter.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:90%
It was really tall.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And the strange
thing about it was

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:90%
the craft wasn't that heavy.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was
big, the EOD personnel

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
actually were able to move
the craft with their truck.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They put a hoist on it, and
they were trying to move it.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.197 align:middle line:84%
And there was some reason
they had to move it.

00:10:26.197 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I guess away from the fire.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And they were able to do it.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
move the craft, which

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:90%
is very odd if it was--

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> --made of some kind of a
metal that can endure a flight

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.338 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:84%
How could it be
lightweight enough to move?

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:90%
But they were able to move it.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And where did they take it?

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they just moved
it away from the fire,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:84%
but eventually the Air Force
came in and transported

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:90%
the craft to Ramstein Air Base.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
They transported the
bodies of the entities.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:84%
They placed them in body
bags and transported them

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to a mortuary
freezer in Ramstein,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and they secured them there.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.675 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, several
days later, a C-5A Galaxy,

00:11:12.675 --> 00:11:13.475 align:middle line:90%
big craft--

00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:90%
The biggest.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> --a cargo plane, one of our
biggest cargo planes in the Air

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Force inventory, was able
to take the UFO on board.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
also took the bodies

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and flew them to
Nellis Air Force Base--

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Nellis, right.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>> --and eventually to Area 51.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> What did those
bodies look like?

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Did you get to see any pictures,
videos, besides the briefing?

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I did.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:84%
The bodies were about
three foot, maybe.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:90%
They weren't very big.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
They were probably
three foot, and I

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
don't think they were
any more than three foot.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
They had helmets.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
The pictures that
I saw had helmets.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
They had smaller arms than
I'd seen on extraterrestrials.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Normally, the arms are longer.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
These weren't that long,
but they were laying down.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
The pictures that I saw, they
were lying down in a coffin.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:84%
They had very distorted
looking fingers, four of them,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
but they had what appears to
be some kind of protrusions

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.948 align:middle line:90%
on each finger.

00:12:17.948 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Like bulbous, or
something coming out of them?

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe bulbous or suction
devices or something.

00:12:23.202 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I'm
looking at a picture,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and I can't really tell
from that picture what they

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:84%
actually-- but there
was some kind of object,

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
some kind of growths or
maybe some kind of a--

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> --a gland maybe or
something like that.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see the face.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.683 align:middle line:90%
It had a helmet on.

00:12:40.683 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What did the
helmets look like?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> The helmet was a clear--

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a fully
cleared heavy helmet.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It had a visor,
but I couldn't see

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
into the visor based on the
angle of the camera, whoever

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:90%
took the picture of it.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:10%
And it had wide
appendages on the side,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:10%
like maybe earphones
or something.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And it had a wire, some
kind of wire that came down

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom of the helmet.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Now that might
have been attached

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to a tube before or something,
but that's all I could see it.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they wearing a uniform?

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:84%
What was the color
of the bodies?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> They had some sort of,
I think, flight suit on.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:90%
It was tight fitting.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really
distinguish-- it

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be a uniform
and not their skin.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But in the picture, you
can't tell everything,

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and it appeared to be some
sort of a grayish uniform.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And they also had boots on.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:10%
They had very, very
heavy looking, thick--

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:10%
I would call them boots.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They might have been some kind
of anti-gravity or something,

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
as I was told later
they were, I think,

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravity or
some kind of boots.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But they were thick and they
were larger, more distorted

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:90%
than their leg would be.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So they were very, very
large boots on there.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And what about the craft?

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
What did the craft
look like inside?

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The craft had
seats, four seats.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:84%
The seats were metal seats, and
they had an instrument panel.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And they had indentations
rather than buttons and knobs

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and switches.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:10%
They had small indentations
all over this instrument panel,

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.943 align:middle line:10%
as if the part of
the skin or whatever

00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:10%
it is on of the
end of the fingers

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:10%
would fit into
those indentations

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:10%
to either operate
the craft or operate

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:10%
the equipment around the craft.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The craft also had small
portals on the top of the dome.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Portals?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Portals, small, round portals
as if you could look in and out

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:90%
of the craft.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Had a-- some kind of a device
or some kind of a metal thing

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that came out from the ceiling,
almost like a lighting system.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But it came out
and had arms on it

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
with these bulbs
around the arms.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:84%
On each one of the arms
on the inside of the arms

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
is if maybe the lighting
system or some other--

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I was told later they think it
was some sort of a navigation

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:90%
tool used.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And the propulsion system
wasn't found out or determined

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:90%
until it got to Area 51.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And I never learned about
the propulsion system.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So were you able to learn
anything after that when it got

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:90%
to Nellis?

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Did they keep it
there, do some testing,

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:90%
then send it to Area 51?

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Or was that just a drop
spot and then refuel and go?

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think they just
flew into Dallas, refueled,

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
because it probably flew
nonstop from Ramstein to Nellis.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they flew to
Area 51, and that was

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:90%
the final destination for the--

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the entities and
the-- the dead entities

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and the craft.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And what they did there as
far as reverse engineering,

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't privy to.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any ideas where
they possibly would have come

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:90%
from?

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The people that examined the
craft at Ramstein found some

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:90%
of these thin--

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
they call them
almost carbon paper.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But they were very
sturdy, and they

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
found these thin
carbon documents

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
they determined to
be maps later in one

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.233 align:middle line:84%
of the containers
inside the craft.

00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:90%
They brought them out.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:50.823 align:middle line:84%
They opened them up, and it
was a form of a star chart.

00:16:50.823 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:90%
And there were many of them.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:90%
There were probably 50 of them.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't sure
exactly how they worked,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
but if you opened them up they
fit perfectly on the monitor.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So if they placed
those star charts--

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:90%
I'm calling them star charts--

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
on this monitor, there
was pinpoints along--

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
on this map or star map, which
would probably indicate either

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
a navigational chart
they used to navigate

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:90%
our solar system, or--

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
but on one of the
charts, they determined

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:90%
it to be our solar system.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The planets, I mean, they
weren't named or anything,

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
but they could distinguish
there were nine planets and then

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:90%
our sun.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that they had
a chart of our solar system.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they determined
where this craft came from.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:84%
But once all this information
got to Area 51, who knows?

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the experts were there,
or one of our guest ETs

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:84%
were there that could
translate it and figure out

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:90%
where it came from.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't know what
happened to the beings,

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:90%
correct, after that?

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:90%
They just were taken?

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> They were taken to Area
51, and I'm sure they were

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:90%
autopsied, but I never learned.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I tried.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's information
out there somewhere,

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:90%
but I never learned.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In these containers were
there any other things besides

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
these carbon star
charts you speak of?

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Did they find any tools or
weapons or supplies or food

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:90%
pellets?

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> They found a
lot of components.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
They found-- they call them
components, objects, devices,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
which no one knew
what they were for.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of
them were in bins.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were in the open.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were around the
display panel by their seats.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
They found a
compartment, and I'm not

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:84%
sure which part of
the craft it was in,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:90%
that was they think tools.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They opened it up and
there were these--

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
they thought they were some
form of tools in there.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I know,
at least at the scene

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.840 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't determine what
these devices or objects

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:90%
or components were for.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they did at Area
51 eventually sometime.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They probably went through
a whole list of things

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to test them and probably
try to reverse engineer them.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure by now that we have.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:90%
So what is your take on it?

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's
your personal take

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:90%
on the crash, the involvement?

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.750 align:middle line:84%
What's your opinion of
why they would come there,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and how we handled the
situation as humans?

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wasn't in a position
to make a determination

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
but others later did, and they
think one particular colonel,

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.410 align:middle line:84%
a flight operations
officer at Ramstein,

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
wrote in a report that was
his opinion that the craft was

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:90%
having problems.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:90%
The intent wasn't to land.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
The intent wasn't to
fly towards Ramstein.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:90%
The craft had problems.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they analyzed the
signatures on the radar

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and comparing to what that
forward observers saw--

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
now, in every air
artillery unit,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.790 align:middle line:90%
they had forward observers.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
They were visually out there
with binoculars, watching it,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and those observers
saw the craft

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:90%
flying in strange patterns.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that could be evasive
flying for an enemy aircraft

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:90%
coming into a hostile zone.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
radio transmissions

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
by one of the forward
observers-- now

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:84%
the forward observers were Air
Force combat controllers type.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
One of them said, I think
this craft has a problem.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It's flying erratically.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:84%
That was in the recordings
made by the controllers.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So this colonel that
wrote this report said

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
is his opinion based on all
the facts that he had was

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that thing was coming
in not as a hostile act,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
but they had some kind
of a problem on board.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, what about
today's protocol?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Has it changed since then much
if there is a craft coming in,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:84%
or is it still the same,
OK, they're not veering off.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:90%
We need to disable this craft.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as of when I
went in and I had access

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to information, most of these
crafts were so highly advanced

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that our weapon systems
couldn't track them, number one.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And the way our weapons
systems worked in the Air Force

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
is the pilot would see the
enemy and would lock on to it,

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and then it would
fire it, this missile.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:84%
The problem we had with
extraterrestrial crafts

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
is we couldn't lock on to it.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Number one, our ranged radio
signals which cause the lock

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:90%
on wouldn't work.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They would either be
jammed, or the signal as it

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
hit the craft would be absorbed
so there wouldn't be any return

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:90%
signal to the Air Force craft.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So there wouldn't be any way
for our craft to lock onto it.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We could and the
pilots could-- they

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to
fire blindly and hope

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that the missile,
heat seeking if it was

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
or radar seeking, whatever,
would hit the craft.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But then again, if
they fired at it,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's been numerous
cases of us firing at it.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Not just us, but
German, South African,

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Iranian, Russian, Chinese
over the period of years

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:90%
tried to lock on and shoot it.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And either the missile
or rocket would

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
detonate prior to
hitting the craft,

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
or it would not detonate,
or it would veer off course.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounded like when they
were coming in and on the first

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.210 align:middle line:84%
attack when we
shot those rockets,

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:90%
you said it kind of disappeared.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
It dematerialized and then
rematerialized somewhere else.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Was it going off course
then or still on course?

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the radar lost it
for that brief time period.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Now it could have been they were
jamming, maybe their last ditch

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:90%
effort.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they had so many
problems inside that ET craft

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:90%
that they were--

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:90%
let's jam it like we would do.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe they were doing that
and they veered off course

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and then they got back on
course, and they had no--

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and I think probably that
first volley of Vulcans

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:90%
damaged the aircraft even more.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Whatever was wrong
with that craft,

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
they had some kind of
disablement inside that craft.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
The Vulcan missiles
hitting it added to it.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Now is there a joint
collaboration with all

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
the countries that you've
mentioned when there is a UFO

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:84%
sighting or when there's
a UFO being shot down?

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there is.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a central collection
station for some countries, not

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.940 align:middle line:90%
all the countries.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the North
American Air Defense Command

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:90%
at NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:84%
All friendly
countries-- now NORAD

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't operate the air
defense for the United States

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and Canada, but they also
have a central depository

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
for bogeys or unidentified
crafts flying anywhere

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, NORAD can control
air sectors all over the United

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
States because of
the satellite's.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.077 align:middle line:84%
Back when it was
first formed, it

00:24:54.077 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:84%
was just had radar sites
all over the United

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
States and Canada that was
controlling only North America.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Now they can control everything.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain countries
who cooperate with us.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:90%
All friendly countries.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Germany and the
NATO countries cooperated.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Japan cooperates.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, South Korea
would cooperate with us,

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Australia, New Zealand.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Now the other
countries that I named,

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
such as Russia,
Iran, or China, we

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:84%
have listening posts and
spy satellites all over that

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
can keep track of
these countries.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So when they encounter
something like this,

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.817 align:middle line:84%
it might take a
little bit of time,

00:25:34.817 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
eventually know about it.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.067 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to advertise it.

00:25:38.067 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Russia is not going to
advertise what they just did,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to collect
it through intelligence,

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
communications intelligence,
human intelligence,

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:84%
or some other
satellite intelligence.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's say with NATO, who
determines who's going to get

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:90%
this craft?

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.318 align:middle line:90%
Who, then, gets these bodies?

00:25:55.318 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to get
these artifacts?

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned a lot that--

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.273 align:middle line:84%
of course, everything
goes to Nellis, Area 51.

00:26:04.273 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:84%
These are all hot spots we
know in the United States

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:84%
where we keep a
lot of this stuff.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But why isn't England and Norway
and Japan, why aren't these--

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.245 align:middle line:90%
who determines where it goes?

00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure who
would determine it,

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:90%
but these countries--

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I know of some instances,
such as the incident that

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
occurred in England or Britain
where the British government

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:84%
felt that it would be more
advantageous for the United

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
States, which had more
resources and more technology,

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to examine something
than they did.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:90%
So they would turn it over to--

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure, although
I don't know for a fact,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure that Norway
and other countries

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:90%
would do the same thing.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.685 align:middle line:84%
Germany, I know Germany
would cooperate.

00:26:54.685 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
The only one I
really know about,

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Germany and the
Netherlands and Britain.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think Ramstein
Air Force base was a magnet

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
for this craft and other craft
because of its capabilities

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:90%
of nuclear activation?

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Ramstein Air Base
had probably the most nuclear

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:90%
weapons in Europe.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They had a huge weapon storage
area in Ramstein in 1974.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Big depot there, yeah.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Big depot, and they
had weapons systems there.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And not only did the
Air Force have weapons,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Miesau Army Depot, which
was a short distance

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:84%
away about 10 miles, had nuclear
weapons, artillery rounds,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.470 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And plus, they had
nuclear-tipped Knight missiles

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and Sergeant missiles, which
also guarded bases over there.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So it very well--
it would make sense

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that this extraterrestrial race
wanted to maybe recon the area.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
They had some way
of determining which

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
bases had nuclear
weapons, and they came in

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:84%
for a reconnaissance mission
and something went wrong.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, once again,
fascinating intelligence.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure, Emery.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:90%
