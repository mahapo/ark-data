00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're at an undisclosed

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:10%
location with Tim.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:10%
Tim's a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Tim, we have a lot of
societal struggles on Earth.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I imagine ET civilizations
might face these challenges

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:90%
for themselves as well.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
How do some species use psionics
to overcome societal struggles?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>> In contrast to what
the situation on Earth is,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the effort in order to have
a mutual benefiting vision

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
for a planet is something that
is way more important to other

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:84%
They know and understand that
the evolvement and development

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
of a species, of
planetary as a whole,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
is something that needs to
have a more or less homogeneous

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:90%
vision to it.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It can go into extremes
like the Greys do.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The Greys have this
huge vision that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:84%
goes not only millennia
but millions and millions

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and millions of
years of dedication

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
through all spaces
and dimensions

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
which will take them

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:84%
the longest in the
whole universe.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
species that understand

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that focusing energy
and dedication

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of a whole collective
memory system into one

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
or another version of that
timeline of their involvement

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:84%
is really, really,
really important.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Because people on Earth,
pretty much everyone

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:84%
has made this experience that
life is pretty hard, it's rough

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and even animals are still
on a level of consciousness

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
where they battle themselves and
everything is kind of chaotic.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The multitude of
different agendas

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that are focused on this
planet is one reason for that.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So in order to bring a more
cohesive, coherent strain

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
of vision, people have found
different techniques to do so.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And one technology
to do so could

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
be artificial
intelligence, which

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
means to create a pseudo
connectivity between species

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and individuals on a
planet and through that,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
create a combined
cohesive vision.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, and we
find that in ancient tribes,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
as well, it is
possible to connect

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to a future version of the same
planet and to reach out to that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
or to even use the
dynamics of the universe

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:90%
in order to connect to a--

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
we call that mindset being,
but it's basically a living

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
organism that is composed of a
set of ideas and visions that

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
is already alive in a dimension
that we cannot connect or see

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:90%
until it's unfolded.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:90%
So that is something--

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
they would call that
like a call or something.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
This is something they connect
to and intuitively feel

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
being called to, which makes
their life a lot more cohesive,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot more productive,
a lot more positive

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
because they have this vision
of themselves somewhere that is

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:84%
calling them from a stable
point in the universe

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and all they have to do is
follow that point instead

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.480 align:middle line:84%
of going in directions
and creating

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:84%
that kind of
distortion and chaos

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.965 align:middle line:84%
that we find here
on this planet.

00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this a technology or a
highly evolved mental ability?

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, it can be both.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Some species have used
technology in order

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
to create something
like that, which makes

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:90%
it a little more experiencable.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So some species
do not tend to be

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
spiritually evolved or
psionically evolved just as

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:90%
much as some other species are.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So they rely heavily
on technology

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a fixed
point in the universe

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:90%
where that timeline is going to.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Some other species,
and we find that idea

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
as well on this planet
when we are thinking of,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.170 align:middle line:84%
for example, religion
and ancient tribes that

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
had, for example, their
ancestors somewhere

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that are like a guiding or
protecting source of energy

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
for them, or even
like the idea of God

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
as a moral and
ethical correct status

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that everyone is
trying to achieve.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Some species do that as
well by creating psionically

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
a version, a being
that is searching

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
the universe for a better home
and then reaching out backwards

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to them so in order to change
the status on that planet

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
so they can move
to that direction.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And once they are
there, they project

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that being out in
the universe again

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:90%
and reach out to the call again.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone on Earth
can do that for themselves

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
as here they have this concept
of a higher self, which

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
means a version of yourself that
might or might not be connected

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
to time, which is, basically,
overseeing the process you do

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and giving you
advice on a subtitle

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of
communicative level.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And the more the
decision is willingly

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
taken to bring this
being into existence,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:84%
the more profound the
communication will be.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So some people experience that
very heavily when they say,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
well, I feel my high being
or I have this intuitive

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
sense of I should do
that and suddenly things

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
will turn out very well.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Then this is on a very small
scale but still effective

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
scale, something that
you could do in order

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
to project out a
version of yourselves

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
to receive that
kind of call that

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
leads you into a certain
direction on the universe.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this psionic ability used
to suppress or can it be used

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to unite collective
consciousness?

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be both.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going into
a direction that

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
might be, for example,
in ancient times

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:84%
in some tribalistic context
where they were summoning

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
a demon or something which
actually means to put out

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
energy into the field of
probability and potential

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and to receive back
energy which might

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
be either beneficial or
malevolent to the tribe.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And that can have
a profound effect

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
if a whole consciousness
is doing that.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
The reason why things got
so distorted here on Earth

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:84%
is because there
are so many agendas

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and so many pushes and pulls
in different directions

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is only projecting

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
certain manifestations
on a very low key level.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
But if a whole
collective-- and we always

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
need to remember that we are
parts of the whole creator,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and the more parts come together
and use their creative powers

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
to move reality into
one or another spot,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is
to create something

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
because everything is one
and everything is alive.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Things that are alive
can reach out back to you

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and they can be
asked for service

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:90%
because it's still yourself.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
If you put your focus there
and energy reacts to that,

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
it can have an interesting and
tremendous effect on reality.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
That is why when you have a
group of people and especially

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
people that connect to each
other and are open-hearted

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even in
love with each other,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that can be used in order
to manifest and to connect

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:90%
to the universe very quickly.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So if the audience come together
in a mindful and respectful,

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:84%
even loving way with
each other, then things

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
can directly affect the
structure of reality.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
This is also why I
love the comments

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
of the community when they were
writing, "all shift happily

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:90%
now."

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:84%
If a lot of people say
that and repeat it,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
then it adds up to the
reality we all perceive.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But if the whole community
says, "all shift happily now,"

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
does the whole community have
to understand what the shift is?

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The looser we expect things
to happen and the more exact

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
we define our wish for something
that is really important

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and what we put our attention
on, in this case, I mean,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
it's all, it's the shift, it's
the way how it shifts, happily,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and when, now.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:84%
These four words or even
three words if you connected--

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
if you connect the
two words together,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
describes the shift from a 3D
conscious to a 4D conscious.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely perfect.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need to add--

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:90%
nothing else needs to be added.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the who, when,
what, and how, then that's

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:84%
everything the universe
needs to know in order

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to project and to
change reality.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So from history, we know that
the Germans in World War II

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:84%
were doing research on that
pretty much because they had

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
some knowledge about
the structure of things

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
way in the past
and how things were

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
back then when we were more
close to our natural state

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And they called
that relationship

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
the so-called Aussengeist, which
meant the ghost from outside.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the living soul of the
universe that is everything

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's still outside
of the experience.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And from that, it
can reach back to it.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking in terms
of a virtual reality--

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and I want to say
that pretty clear

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that it depends on your
decision, what it is.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It's more than a virtual reality
but it can be defined as one.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Then, this is the inside of
everything like the software,

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
whereas the
so-called Aussengeist

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:84%
is the computer that is
reaching back or rendering

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.000 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
more perspectives on that

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and the universe is far more
than just a virtual reality,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:90%
but it can also--

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:84%
our models could
be applied to that.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we write our fate or only
react to it when we're talking

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:07.485 align:middle line:90%
about psionics?

00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So the most correct answer
to that would be that reacting

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:90%
and writing our destiny--

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
reacting to reality or writing
reality is the same thing.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:90%
You know, yin and yang.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But to give a more
hands-on approach to that,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.720 align:middle line:84%
we can absolutely change our
own reality to the better

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and everyone who is
inside of our own reality

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
gets affected by what you
project out in your reality.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing a good job,
people will come to you,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
people feel home, feel a sense
of we're going somewhere.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, that will
lead to a universe

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
where every particle,
every consciousness unit

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:84%
eventually will
find a place of home

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
where it will vibrate
in the best version.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, and that
is what the universe is

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
interested in, we have
a complete picture

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of a geometrical form
and at that point,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
another universe will
expand from that.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it used
intergalactically?

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone here on Earth
is experiencing a very basic

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and fundamental form of reality
which means that through

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:84%
a certain benevolent protection
barrier of this Earth,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
every consciousness unit or
every individual can experience

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:84%
reality and also consequences
without being too hard affected

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:90%
by the consequences.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Which means, in other
realms of consciousness

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and of the universe,
things will appear

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:90%
and manifest much quicker.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And through this protection
barrier, a lot of human people

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
have distorted and paradoxed
thoughts and actions that

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:90%
are not cohesive or productive.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And they can do that
quite a long time

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
until something bad is
happening or some cataclysm

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:90%
is hitting in.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
This is some kind of a
practicing life sphere

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:84%
this Earth is, so that people
from consciousness level 3

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and level 4 can
somehow learn how

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to experience the universe
in a kind of gentle way.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But there are other realms
of the universe where

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.420 align:middle line:90%
things appear much quicker.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.965 align:middle line:84%
And higher frequencial
beings from level five up

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
on, they are connected by
so-called cosmic adhesion,

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
which means that
through inherent powers,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:90%
they are drawn together.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
If a paradox is occurring, then
natural powers will divide them

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and some other form of
geometrics will stick to them.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Through that, they move
this geometrical picture

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:90%
that they all form.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you talking about
psionics used as a technology

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
or is it exclusively
for the mind?

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if an
individual has psionic ability,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:84%
can this technology
amplify that ability?

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> An individual is a small
unit of a more widely spread

00:16:54.610 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
collective awareness, which is
also a smaller part of an even

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:90%
broader sense of consciousness.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So an individual can have
some kind of power psionically

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:90%
in order to move certain things.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
And two things are
important here.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.720 align:middle line:90%
The first thing is repetition--

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:84%
so training, basically,
and the second thing

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
is no contrary
thoughts or realities.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So if someone wants to achieve
something, manifest something,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
he or she should make
sure that the reality

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:84%
he's manifesting as
for the mutual benefits

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
as a win-win
situation for everyone

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
so that the common
denominator is something

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:90%
that everyone can agree upon.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:90%
That helps a lot.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Also coming together
in groups will

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
help a lot because more parts
of the one consciousness

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
come together and
project all their energy.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
There are technologies that
can enhance that ability.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
There are some species that
are more skilled in that,

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:90%
some are less skilled.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
One thing-- and this is
a negative word spoken

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that has affected
Earth a lot, is

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:84%
part of the
installation that is now

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:29.200 align:middle line:84%
being removed in order to keep
people close-minded to a level

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
3 reality by making them
think that everything

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
is materialistic
and everything has

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:90%
to be just this and not that.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And by more and
more people getting

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
aware of all the possibilities
and beauties and wonders

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, this
will shift and people

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:84%
will come to a more divine
and understanding status

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:90%
of their own powers.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> What can be holding it back?

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some species
that are more capable of using

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
psionics, which means the
ability to alter your reality

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:84%
by thought, and some species
are less capable of doing that.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Humans, as a species, have a
great potential in doing that.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
They can spiritually
connect to the universe

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:90%
in a very fine way.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:84%
But it is really, really
challenging to use psionics

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
when you're inside and in
the frequency of Earth.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
You will only have
very minor effects.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Some people have, I
mean, shown something

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
like bending spoons
by their will

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
or moving objects by
their will or also

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
being very connected to the
thoughts of other people.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's still pretty hard
as the frequency of Earth

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:90%
is very distorted.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So a being outside
of the influence

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:84%
of the collective
energy of Earth

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:84%
might be very well using
psionics somewhere else

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
but might have minor
effect when on Earth.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:84%
You could compare it
to gravity as when

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
you have a very high
gravity, it pulls everything

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
so strongly down to the ground
that you can only, I mean,

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:84%
lift a certain
amount while, when

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
you have a less strong gravity,
you can lift a lot more weight.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the kilos, it's
about other forces and fields

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:90%
that draw something in.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That's interesting because
astronauts had success with

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
psionic experiments in space
that were more challenging

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
How could that happen up
there but not on the ground?

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The collectively shared
field of reality that we all are

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:84%
contributing in, as people
on Earth have been put

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
into a belief system where
they project out the incapacity

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
of influencing the
field of reality,

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that is also influencing
the field of reality.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:90%
So that makes things very hard.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Which means, you have a lot of
people that are not strongly

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in that psionic evolvement
but as the mass of people

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is pretty high, they
are contributing

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:53.825 align:middle line:84%
in the lack of potential
efficiency of psionics.

00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think
this is not happening

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's not possible to use
it, they create a reality

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:90%
where it's more hard to do so.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone
who wants to change

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:84%
reality or use psionics
in some way or another

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
have to overcome and overpower
everyone else in the room.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it pretty
difficult and hard

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:90%
to maintain those psionics.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, and this has been
used by some other species who

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
take advantage of that, the
individuals on this planet

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
are not pretty trained
in using psionics.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:84%
That makes a malevolent
species attracted

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:84%
to come here and use their
own powers, which are also

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:84%
downgraded when they
are in this field,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
but they can still overcome
a poorly trained human being

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
by their thought process and
overpower those structures.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But at some point
or another, they

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
need to go back into their
reality and shared reality

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:90%
to regenerate all the energies.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying reminds
me of the Maharishi Effect

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:84%
where he said, that if you
have a certain percentage

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
of the population meditating
for peace as an example,

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:90%
you'll influence that outcome.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:84%
That sounds a lot like
the flip side of humans.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> 100% true.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And whoever installed all those
education systems and science

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
on Earth has altered reality
in a less benevolent way

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
for humanity because as
we know, apes species have

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:84%
this specification
that they build

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
upon group conformity, which
means the common narrative is

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
something they stick to and they
try to re-educate everyone who

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:90%
wants to step outside of that.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So everyone watching,
be aware of the fact

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that you can contribute
to the reality

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and to the mutual
benefit of reality.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
You can do that on your own,
you can put your best version

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and project into the field,
and if you have no idea at all

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:21.490 align:middle line:84%
how to do it, then go with what
the community says and do all

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:90%
shift happily now.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, in advanced
E.T. civilizations,

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.175 align:middle line:84%
are these psionic
abilities driven by AI?

00:24:30.175 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So AI makes logics
a little more easy.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Because when you assume
that the universe is just

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:48.055 align:middle line:84%
a virtual reality, everything
is more easy to alter, you know?

00:24:48.055 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:84%
You can just pop up a
menu, adjust this and that,

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and things will change
according to the parameters

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and algorithms
that you put into.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
The thing with AI
is that it needs

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:90%
to be very well programmed.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, it can
be easily affected

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
through outside
influences which makes

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
it a little harder on the
other side to maintain it

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and to have a stable
system that does that.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessary, especially,
not for human beings

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
which are capable of psionic;
of mind-elevating powers.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I would always say
that when you focus

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.950 align:middle line:84%
on good energy and
the mutual benefit

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and project that
into your reality

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and also be aware that reality
will shift and change--

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and everybody I've been talking
to has some story or another

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.555 align:middle line:84%
Like thinking of somebody and in
that case, your telephone rings

00:26:06.555 --> 00:26:08.970 align:middle line:90%
- might be something.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Start with something simple.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty sure
that the audience

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:84%
is very well-trained in
using all those stuff.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not doing
basic training here,

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just giving out
the convincing idea

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:84%
or the convincer that
reality can be altered.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:84%
You're not a victim of yourself,
you are the creator as well as

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:90%
everyone else.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And the more people
come together

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and the more they contribute
to everything, the better.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Also not propagating
the idea that only one--

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.710 align:middle line:84%
giving down one idea is
the best way to do it.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that every
consciousness unit

00:26:53.370 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
has a wonderful and personal
space where he or she or it

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
contributes to the
well-being of everything.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And whatever is
your personal home,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
go there and give the best
of the energy into the room

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and connect with others

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Tim, that was fantastic.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for the information.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Next, on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.495 align:middle line:84%
>> A clone is
basically just a copy.

00:27:29.495 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially a
soulless copy of a person.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There are beings
that look like humans,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:84%
which are approachable,
you can talk to them,

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.655 align:middle line:84%
but they are not
consciousness unit.

00:27:42.655 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And often, when
we go to them,

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:84%
we find that these are rogue
covert programs that the people

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:90%
in charge of know nothing about.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
that they're operating.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you guys aware of any
corporations that are making

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:90%
clones for their own agendas?

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:90%
