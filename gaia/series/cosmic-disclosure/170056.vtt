[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:15.235 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.757 align:middle line:84%
And here again with
me is Emery Smith.

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Emery, thank you for being here.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH:
You're welcome, Dave.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.495 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of
the things that we

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
have talked about
on Cosmic Disclosure

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.572 align:middle line:84%
greatly is this idea of
a secret space program.

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We haven't really
covered that yet.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have
confirmed the existence

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of reverse engineered craft,
so one would conclude,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
or one would be
thinking to conclude,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that if we have craft
that are essentially

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
space-faring vehicles
that came here

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
from other solar systems, or
maybe even other galaxies,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and we can build those,
that we would then

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
be able to leave Earth
and potentially settle

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any direct
briefings or knowledge

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:84%
about that aspect of
what may be going on?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Well, there
is laws out there,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:10%
and there is a type of
federation involved,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:10%
from what I was briefed on.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a you can just
go-- just like you can't just

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
go from here to Europe without
a passport, and a couple

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
of weapons, by the way.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is also applied
to intergalactic travel.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.352 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we do have the
ability to take ET home.

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:34.685 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: As Ben [? Rich ?] says.

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:36.018 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: As [? Ben Rich ?] said.

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But the ability
to actually do it

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
is another story until we
start behaving a little bit

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
more proper here
on the planet Earth

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and with evolving our
consciousness and stop killing

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
each other, which they all
understand, extraterrestrials,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:84%
because they were here,
at one time, themselves.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So getting back
to your question,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:90%
yes, we have these craft.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they are anti-gravity, and
they can travel through space.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
interdimensional yet,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of, so I've
not been briefed on that.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I know of people say
they do have this,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not aware
of it, of the craft.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So they're just using
special propulsion units

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and other means to create
a gravitational force

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:90%
for these devices.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the military
devices we have out there,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, such as planes
and helicopters,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
those are already installed
in these special jet fighter

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:90%
aircraft.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So what's the best way to hide
something is don't change the--

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't matter
what shape it's in.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.597 align:middle line:84%
But that could be an
actual spacecraft.

00:02:41.597 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the things
that Pete Peterson has shared

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
with me is that there
are a lot of new crafts

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen
in various movies,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
like "Avatar," like
"Edge of Tomorrow,"

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
in which they have turbo fans
on them, which sometimes move.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said that our
Naval ships have all

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
been loaded with these
covertly at this time

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and that eventually, once
they roll out anti-gravity,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that the jet engines
or the propellers

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:84%
will be replaced with
anti-gravity engines.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious if you've
heard anything like that.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, I haven't.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I have seen different
types of schematics

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
for newer craft and ships and
for the Navy and Air Force,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, that do show more
of an anti-grav type situation,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
but not manipulating
the current force.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe they already
have these ready to go.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:90%
They're just sitting somewhere.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:90%
And they already have it.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just I don't know
where it's at or who did it.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Another aspect, which
it's a real shame that we

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get you on camera
with William Tompkins--

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:90%
he's now deceased--

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:84%
but you have said to me that you
have some insider friends who

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
are around Tompkins' age or
maybe a little younger, who

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
might be willing
to come forward.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that maybe with
you coming out on this program

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.661 align:middle line:84%
that this will help
to set a trend where

00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:84%
some others will now be able
to come forward, as well?

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why one of the
main reasons was to come out

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:84%
was to basically
help other people

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.109 align:middle line:84%
and inspire them to come
out and talk and feel

00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
free to talk about
some of the things

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
they did with the projects,
anything from energy

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:84%
to the extraterrestrials
to medicine to all

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:84%
these fantasmical, amazing
devices and things.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think by being here,
I'm hoping to inspire them,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
after they see this,
to come forward.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
personally ask them

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
myself to please come forward,
or at least invite them

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:84%
to entertain it, or even have
a private meeting with you

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and other people, if they
don't want to show their face.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And as
you've seen, once--

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
because I've interviewed
so many insiders--

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
once we start talking,
all these things pop up.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.354 align:middle line:84%
And I might have heard
something 15 years ago

00:05:08.354 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that I'll remember when
somebody else tells me

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, or
something very similar.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct, right.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
so interesting,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
is to know that you worked
on a project for so long

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and had no idea that
this person also

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
was working on a similar project
halfway around the world.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually exchange
information finally freely,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:90%
without being scared to do so.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And just like some of the
stuff I explained to you,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
you already knew
some of this stuff.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And you knew I had-- we've
never even talked about it.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's even a
great confirmation, for me,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.425 align:middle line:84%
to know that there's
others out there that

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
have spoke to you about
these amazing technologies

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and places, especially the
places, which blow me away.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like the fact
that Ecuador and Antarctica

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.671 align:middle line:90%
have very similar stuff.

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, and I've
never said that to anyone.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And we just
had it happen on camera.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious about whether
you, through briefings

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or through maybe some of the
insiders that you personally

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
know, not including the people
we've interviewed on Cosmic,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
are you aware of there being
outposts on the moon or Mars

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that we use with these back
engineered craft that we have?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You know, Dave,
I've seen and heard a lot,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have
firsthand experience

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
to say I was definitely
in that spot.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I may have been
and not known it.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I concur there's
something going on there

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.762 align:middle line:84%
and that there is some sort of
base set up there, of course,

00:06:44.762 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
because that goes back
to the other stuff

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
I used to work with, with the
portals and the other things,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:90%
that you and I discussed.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you never know where
you might be, but I did

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
hear many of these
stories that you have.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.325 align:middle line:84%
But I was never on a
briefing, by the way,

00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that specifically said, we have
a base here or a base there.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I've just read a lot
of classified documents

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
from other people like me
that were involved with that,

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
so it was secondhand
information.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: If you have heard
secondhand information,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping we can get
a little more specific,

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:90%
because more than one insider--

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.345 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe five different
insiders-- have told me--

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and this would include Corey
Goode as just one of them--

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and there were others well
before I ever started to talk

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to him about this stuff,
saying that, in fact,

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
the majority of the solid
planets and the solid moons

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system have at
least some degree of outpost

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:90%
on them now--

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --that we can use.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So have you heard
scuttlebutt like that?

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.071 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.111 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, could you be
a little more specific.

00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, when
you say outpost,

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:84%
it means a place to
get to and go to.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually not on
the surface of that planet,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:90%
so you know.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's on the inside
of the planet,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're using some sort
of portal technology and craft

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to get back and forth from these
places, when it is safe to.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So some of the
rumors that you've heard,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
like, for example,
let's talk about Mars.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard rumors
of there being perhaps,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, very
large bases that

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:84%
might even have 200,000 people
working at them on Mars?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, I have heard that.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I've definitely heard that.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's a known thing.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a joke
in the underground.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What would
be funny about it?

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.503 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, you just never--

00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
like we were talking
about earlier, when

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
you're on a conveyor
belt going somewhere,

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
going through energy
systems, and then

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:84%
you wind up
underground somewhere,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and it feels different, like
even the atmosphere feels

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
different, what's not
to say that they're

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:90%
using these things?

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.381 align:middle line:84%
And people don't know
that they're actually

00:08:57.381 --> 00:08:58.754 align:middle line:90%
on Mars, working there.

00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that's what you
and I started to talk about

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
after we had described
your travel through Sandia

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
into this base where
you did the autopsy.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I started scratching
my head after we

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.456 align:middle line:84%
did that interview,
because you hadn't told me

00:09:14.456 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:90%
that part before.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But others had described
the exact same hall

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.654 align:middle line:84%
as being a portal, and that
when you start at the beginning,

00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
you're in one place, and
at the end, you're another.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm thinking,
why would they

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
waste 10 or 15
minutes of your shift

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.304 align:middle line:90%
having you sit on a gondola?

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.489 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Because they have
fast sub shuttles, right?

00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness, yeah.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They have [? maglev ?]
tubes and the trains,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:90%
This is a little different.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
This is like what
we talked about.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't know,
but you did open me up

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of other
questions, now that you

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
said that, because many other
people have also expressed,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that worked on these
projects, that they

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
felt different from where
they thought they were.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And now it makes a
little bit more sense.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I never was thinking
that, because I

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
was so young at
the time and wasn't

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
as educated as I am now
about all the stuff they

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
did have at that time.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, part
of what occurs to me

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is that if you are
potentially, as you

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
said in previous episodes,
autopsying potentially

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.822 align:middle line:84%
multiple bodies in one day,
and they're all different--

00:10:20.822 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get a lot
more into that and how they're

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
different and what they look
like, in future episodes,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
because you're one of
these insiders who's

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
got a very complex
testimony that's

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:84%
not going to be done in one or
two half-hour episodes at all.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So if we are looking at
all of these bodies--

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:90%
you yourself had 3,000--

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
how many other
rooms do you think

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.040 align:middle line:84%
there were in this
Sandia base, where

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
other guys like you were doing
the same thing you were doing?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Could you speculate perhaps?

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It would have to
be, if I look at the levels,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
five, seven, and eight
were the levels that were

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:90%
medical for this type of thing.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them had over
300 of these operating rooms.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're looking at
over 1,000 operating rooms just

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.904 align:middle line:90%
in this one base alone?

00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I believe so, yeah.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow. .

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
imply that if you--

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.554 align:middle line:84%
and over how many years did you
see 3,000 bodies on the job?

00:11:22.554 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, my
goodness, that was

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:84%
from August if '92 to '95 of
June, so probably [? two-- ?]

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:90%
three years.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So basically,
three years.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.844 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Three years, yeah.

00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:38.286 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So that's like
basically 1,000 bodies a year.

00:11:38.286 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it's tissue
samples, not all bodies,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:90%
remember.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But just to stick
with that number for a minute,

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.752 align:middle line:84%
we could then say
that one base alone--

00:11:47.752 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and that would be providing
it's only one base, which

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:90%
it obviously is not.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But they
could be processing

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.540 align:middle line:84%
over a quarter million different
extraterrestrial species

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.682 align:middle line:90%
on autopsies per year.

00:12:00.682 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, if
you did the math,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and you were counting each
sample as one species, yes.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But it could be many
samples from one species

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
for a whole wing
of 50-unit rooms.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:90%
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Guys like you doing it.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But yes, if it was per
species, it would be that many.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So to extrapolate, if
NASA is now saying 40 billion

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:10%
watery Earth-like planets just
in our Milky Way galaxy alone--

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:10%
and they slipped
that under the radar.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people haven't even
realized that that came out.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And we've had other
insiders tell us

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that that was part of a treaty,
with benevolent ETs forcing

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
our guys to start
leaking things like that,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
to make it easier for
disclosure to happen.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But if there's 40 billion Earths
in our galaxy alone, and life

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
seems to be very abundant,
and intelligent life

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
seems to be written into
the background of quantum

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:90%
mechanics itself--

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Everywhere.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --then even a
quarter million bodies,

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
a quarter million species,
is not that many--

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, it's not.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --compared to
what could be out there.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's nothing.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I told you
the 3,000 number,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
everyone always gets
a little surprised.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about,
as you just said it,

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:90%
it's a very small number.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But OK, if we
peeled back the curtain here,

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Emery, and we do a little
imaginative speculation,

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
doesn't it appear that your
job and what you personally

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
dealt with could be the
byproduct of exactly

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the sort of secret space program
that we're talking about,

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
where part of the testimony
was that there's no money,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:90%
but that you get paid in trade?

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And do you think possibly that
those bodies were payments

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that we were receiving
from other groups

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:84%
in exchange for, apparently,
all this high tech that we're

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:90%
making?

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's a
possibility, yes.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I also have to reiterate,
out of the 3,000, over 3,000,

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
samples, I call them,
don't forget some of those

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:90%
could have been lab grown.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Those could have been just
hybrid things they made here.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So I can't speculate they
were all extraterrestrial.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know a lot of them
were of un-Earth origin.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they
could be absolutely

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
from some sort of a trade,
inside trade thing, going on,

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
to get technology and
to learn other things.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the nature of
compartmentalization, you're

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:84%
not allowed to
ask any questions.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:84%
You're just going in
there, doing your job,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:90%
handling this very exotic stuff.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was it like,
when you'd come home at night,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.989 align:middle line:84%
having autopsied something very
bizarre-looking, let's say?

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:52.155 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It was fascinating.

00:14:52.155 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What
would you feel when

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:90%
you're lying in bed at night?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to go to
sleep, or would you--

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --sometimes just be--

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, I was fascinated.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm always intrigued.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.969 align:middle line:84%
I was always intrigued
about the human body.

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was just
a fascinating thing.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:90%
I wanted more.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.784 align:middle line:84%
I was upset that I would have
to go and work in a hospital

00:15:11.784 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:90%
every couple of hours.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was really neat
to see all this stuff

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and then go home and say,
wow, what else is out there?

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And that inspired
me to do more things

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and take more opportunities
with the military and other

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:90%
industrial complexes.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And that just opened
up so many things,

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
because I had so many answers,
like everyone else did.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what's going on.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And I can't believe--

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe anything
I read, see, or hear.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I can't, because I know that
it can all be so modified,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
new 3-D programs they

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:90%
have on the satellites now.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could put another
David Wilcock right here

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and reflect light
and cast a shadow

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and have light glistening
out of your eyes.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't
tell the difference.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.017 align:middle line:90%
So at this time--

00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
of course, with photoshopping
and everything else,

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:90%
it's very hard for me.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, at a very young
age, I'm going to go out,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
find out for myself.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing this strictly
just to find out for myself

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:90%
what is going on.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And all's it did was open up
100 million other questions.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Every time you find
something else out,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
it opens up more
questions, which is great,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.342 align:middle line:84%
because it inspires me to go
ahead and keep moving forward,

00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:84%
especially if there's
opportunities there

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
where people want me to be
part of amazing projects.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm very thankful of all
my opportunities I had.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%
They were not too negative.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.095 align:middle line:84%
So I think, if that would
answer your question of why

00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Corey Goode
has also shared with us

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that there were factions in
the Secret Space Program.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was called
the Interplanetary Corporate

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Conglomerate, or ICC.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
they are offshoots

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
of the defense contractors,
who are manufacturing

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:90%
very advanced technology.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, we humans
have become a go to place

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
for many different species
to buy advanced technology,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:90%
like craft.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And he also said that he
found out that we apparently

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
are in regular trade
relations with some 900

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
different extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:90%
just through the ICC.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious if you ever
heard back chatter, scuttlebutt,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:90%
anything like that?

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.374 align:middle line:84%
I'm unaware of that, and
I've never heard that before.

00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But it's so
compartmentalized, right?

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I would not know.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
You're never alone, and
you're always monitored.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Like I told you, you always
have the bracelet on.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It's such high security.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's hallways
there that will cut you

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:84%
in half if you are
in the wrong place,

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:90%
without asking questions.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very simple job
if you just follow the dots.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't, you
got to be careful.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really go
around asking questions,

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
because I was too excited
about getting more security

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
clearances and
moving up the ladder

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
to get more jobs
in different places

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:90%
other than dissecting tissues.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:90%
It brought much to the crafts.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:90%
It brought me to other things.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that you told me

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:84%
about that I think would be a
good point for us to get into--

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I was asking you about
the folder, which

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.339 align:middle line:84%
is this thing that--
they called it a folder,

00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe to reduce
psychological impact.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically like a iPad
with a little bit flexible

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and almost totally clear.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.008 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you also said that
the folder could be loaded.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.684 align:middle line:84%
It would tell you what wing,
what room, and what being you

00:18:55.684 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:90%
were going to be working on.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.474 align:middle line:84%
They would only give
you one at a time.

00:18:58.474 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So did the folder
have any type of hard drive

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:90%
or storage mechanism?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.675 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, it did.

00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:07.474 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:19:07.474 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm surprised you
mention that, but yeah.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:90%
It's called a micro disk.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: A micro disk.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it's a little
bit smaller than a quarter,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:90%
but larger than a nickel.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's gold-plated, made of
some sort of iridium gold,

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and there's a little,
teeny slot for that.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And it records everything
that you're doing.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And it also connects
to the construct

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
of the base-- of
the underground ba--

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
with construct is their--
like a main frame.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So that little thing
is then taken from you

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.515 align:middle line:84%
and put on a shuttle,
and they store it

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:90%
in space, all the disks.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.320 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So I would
imagine that if you

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.010 align:middle line:10%
had your folder in
the early 1990s,

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:10%
when we're back with
the whiny, loud,

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:10%
desktop tower computers, that
we're dealing with something

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.059 align:middle line:10%
a lot more advanced than
even what we have now.

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:04.224 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, this is far
more advanced than anything

00:20:04.224 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that you guys have
today, right now.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking high
resolution video pictures

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and millions of
documents of information

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
all on this little small,
very, very thin disk.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So do you
think these disks might

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:10%
have like thousands of terabytes
of storage or maybe even more?

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yes, I
would concur to that.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what
was the protocol?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.532 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to remove the
micro disk from the folder

00:20:35.532 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and hand it to someone?

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.906 align:middle line:84%
Or did you just hand your
folder in at the end of the day?

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No, yeah, the
folders, number one,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
when you put them in and
slide them into this thing,

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:90%
the disk comes out.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But you can take that disk out,
just like you do today with SD

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:90%
cards or cards for your camera.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
You can easily
take it in and out,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:84%
which sometimes you
had to, because you

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
had to review another,
someone else's project.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.233 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So that's
why that was there,

00:21:01.233 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
so instead of it being
automatically downloaded--

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:84%
they didn't like information
going over a wire--

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
so they use these
disks for that.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.081 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Where on the
folder would you insert?

00:21:12.081 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The top right corner.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Top right
corner, interesting.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So I guess you
could see it then,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- you
said it's a gold color.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.475 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, you
could see it inside,

00:21:20.475 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and it has like an
iridium tint to it.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered if they
did that to protect it

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
from the radiation of space,
since it was stored in space,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:90%
they said.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was there
any way to access

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
the information on the
disk other than the folder?

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.022 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, there is one way.

00:21:37.022 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Hmm.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.679 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind of
reader or something?

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There is
a disk reader, yes.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the reason
why they haven't given us

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that kind of storage
technology would be what?

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we have that
level of data storage

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.509 align:middle line:90%
if the technology exists?

00:21:53.509 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Why would it not be
shared with the public?

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because then you won't
go out and buy a 256-K phone.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just too far advanced
from where we are now.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They won't make any
money, these corporations.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.961 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, we have
to start really, really

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:90%
small for these corporations.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:84%
They already have
it, but we're not

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:90%
going to get it right today.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: It seems like
if you see the movie

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:10%
"Snowden," allegedly,
he was able to get

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:10%
one of these little USB
sticks inside a Rubik's cube,

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:10%
and then he tossed
it to the guy,

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:10%
and he went through the gate.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you think anybody has ever
tried to get a mini disk out

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:90%
of the base?

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How might that be done?

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's tricky,
but can be done, yeah.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, you don't
want to go into that.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I had a
few of the disks, yes.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: You did?

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.719 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The micro disk, yeah.

00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:58.197 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How might somebody
be able to do that?

00:22:58.197 --> 00:23:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I'd
rather not say that part.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK, OK.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But I have acquired
a few of those disks, yes.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.164 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And when your
house was broken into,

00:23:09.164 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
were those some of the
things that were taken?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yes, they
took the disks.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:90%
So you did have them--

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --but you lost them?

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, that was
very, very unfortunate.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It was
very unfortunate,

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.465 align:middle line:90%
very angry about it and upset.

00:23:21.465 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you
tell us a little bit

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
about what happened
to your house

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.005 align:middle line:84%
and where you had stored those
disks and how were they found?

00:23:28.005 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, sure.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So I had a small home
in New Mexico that

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
was gated with an
iron gate and concrete

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
post and a keypad, the whole
thing, a very small, small home

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that I temporarily got just
to store some small belongings

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.740 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I was working on a
project out in southeastern New

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Mexico, and I was there for
about a year, nine months.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:90%
I had this place.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:90%
So what I did was I--

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of course, I don't keep all
my stuff in the same spot,

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:90%
and I keep some duplicates.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
duplicates to this--

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:90%
I can't duplicate some things--

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of just information
on hard drives, and whatnot.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And I got a call,
because I was going

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
to be moving to Los
Angeles to be with you

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
and work on some other projects.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So I told the realtor, hey,
I'm going to be moving.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:90%
So they put it up for sale.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was just leasing
the place at the time.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had basically
hidden all my stuff

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:84%
inside the walls of
the house, and you

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:90%
couldn't tell where they were.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Also in the concrete and
other various places--

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to talk about
other specific places,

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:84%
because I still use
those techniques.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it was safe
temporarily for this.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I also had the [? over ?]
[? unity ?] device there,

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
which, fortunately,
I went to go pick up.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was within a week
the house was ransacked.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And another week later,
it was ransacked.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.516 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
realtor called me and says,

00:25:09.516 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, I looked
through your window.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:90%
You left your house such a mess.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
How am I supposed
to show anybody?

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, my house
is perfectly spotless.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, please go around
the house and look around.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And he did, and he
found the back garage

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:90%
door was broken into.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.822 align:middle line:84%
And then the double bolted
locked door to the main home

00:25:28.822 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
was kicked in with
a big footprint.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.488 align:middle line:90%
And we have all the pictures.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let's roll right
now the film that you took.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.320 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.000 align:middle line:90%
This is the garage--

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:90%
complete destruction.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Took all the equipment.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:84%
The lab has been
completely destroyed.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So why do
you think whoever

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.980 align:middle line:84%
did this would take
everything you've got

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and leave only your military
badges in a box and a bullet

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.570 align:middle line:90%
on the countertop?

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.884 align:middle line:90%
What was the message?

00:25:57.884 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, I think they
were just some old friends

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.795 align:middle line:84%
trying to look me up
to have a good time.

00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think it really had to do
with the device, number one,

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:84%
because ever since I started
the lab with the device,

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.914 align:middle line:84%
it's been getting-- it's
been getting really crazy.

00:26:15.914 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And now that I proved
the device worked,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:90%
then it got really crazy.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
used a satellite

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and found out all the stuff
underground and in the walls.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they did cut the walls open
and take all those hard drives

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.750 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about 8 computers,
12 laptops, 40 hard drives,

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:84%
over 300 SD cards,
lots of information.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:84%
My world's-- my whole
30 years of work.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What's the purple tip?

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, oh it's just the
type of bullet it is, yeah.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a very high
velocity bullet.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not normally
a civilian bullet

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:90%
that you can buy from civilians.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a 5 by 7 by 28
armor-piercing ammunition,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
which is used by tactical
forces all around the world.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What could you
say to other insiders who

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:84%
would hear a story like
that and say, well, my god,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
if they start doing that to
me, the first thing I'd do

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:84%
is go into hiding,
and I wouldn't speak?

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, let's talk about
it, because I wasn't going,

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.250 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think the information, too,
that I had was I couldn't see--

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really see the
information that I had,

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
like 90% of it was pretty much
just already out there stuff.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think it was just that
10% and the device, that,

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:84%
hey, just why don't you
slow up a little bit,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
on a trajectory

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:84%
here that looks like you're
going to say something

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.330 align:middle line:90%
that you shouldn't say.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So they were
trying to threaten you.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think that
anybody who comes forward

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.259 align:middle line:84%
is safer than if they
don't, if they're already

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:90%
starting to speak a little bit?

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Is it safer to be public?

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yes, at a certain
point, you have to go public.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's very-- it's much safer.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:84%
We all know this,
and this is one

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
of the main reasons I'm here
in front of you right now.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.008 align:middle line:84%
All right, well,
there you have it.
