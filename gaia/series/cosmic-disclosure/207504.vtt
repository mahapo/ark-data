00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.983 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.983 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's good to be here.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We've talked
a lot about the Greys.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
What other ET races are
influencing our planet?

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Today we're heading
towards the really, really

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:84%
dark abyss of the
universe because we're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
talking about one
reptilian species that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
is mentioned as an
enemy of the Greys

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and also became an allegedly
enemy to the Earth people.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And we already heard
a lot of stories

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
from people in the
military that fought them.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And I got to admit that I don't
feel too comfortable speaking

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:90%
about this topic.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's still really
important to understand

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:90%
what is happening right now.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to do that.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
From my point as a
political diplomatic being,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I try to be as
neutral as possible.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I also have to mention
that I did not really

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:90%
meet the species at all.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had one incident
which turned out badly.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that
we are now talking about

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
is something that comes
directly from the Greys

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:90%
or from the earthly military.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
that and about the species.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still trying to
be as neutral as possible

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and maybe offer some
exit strategies to that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
because the military clearly
has a different opinion on that.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The species we are
talking about I

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:84%
know as being called
by the Greys as Zorgon.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did the Greys come
up with the name Zorgon?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, the Greys came
up with the name Zorgon.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the way they
named that species.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of people
will now get to Google.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But they will find information
on a fictitious species

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
from, I don't know, some
book or anything else

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and some details on that,
which is purely nonsense.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I have two explanations to that
because the military, at least

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
the episodes that I've seen
and the information that I've

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
read and pop culture,
they have a different name

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:90%
for the species.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
the same species.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys came up
with the name Zorgon.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And I have two explanations.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
One is either this is the thing
about the subconsciousness

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
because they were applying
to earthly languages.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And some words were just
off in the communication.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And they might have
seen that there

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who wrote
a fictitious book

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
about a reptilian race.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:90%
This is option one.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of moved this name
into the language of the Greys

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
communicating with us.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:84%
The second option, which
could also be possible--

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and keep in mind that this is
the time traveling species that

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:90%
overlook a lot of things.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They might have put that
name so the audience can

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
go to Google or something
and put it in and see

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
the images because there are
no officially released images

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:90%
of non-terrestrial beings yet.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And what they see, that pretty
much depicts this species.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do the Zorgons resemble
any other race in the ET world

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:90%
that we know of?

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I think from what I've
read in pop culture

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and what I've heard about
other people coming forward

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
with their stories and
encounters with the species,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about the species
that is called the Draco.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that how these
beings refer to themselves?

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I don't know.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:90%
I've never met them.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:90%
There was one incident where--

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was naive and young.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, I was
able to communicate peacefully

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and constructively
with the Greys.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're not easy to handle.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
You need to be
careful about them.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, yeah,
let me check on them.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:90%
But it went wrong.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember things.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a terrible PTSD
for about two months.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But I thought a dragon
would attack me somewhere.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:90%
So that was terrible.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very, a, cautious.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And, b, as I do not have
any direct information,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm only giving you
second-hand information.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And I need to say that before
we continue with the episode.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we
have any idea where

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:90%
the Zorgons originate from?

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I don't know that.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I have not looked
into the cases.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I have no memorized direct
experience with them.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I have been told that they
had in some point of history

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:90%
some basis on Earth.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And they might have evolved from
some kind of dinosaur reptilian

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:90%
species way back.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know that.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I do know and we all know that
there are stories about dragons

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:90%
in the history of man.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
dragons everywhere-- depicted

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It might be because
they resemble that

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
in a way from the appearance
that this is the same species.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.540 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know that.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the
characteristics of the Zorgons?

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: What I want to say is
that maybe this is all a hoax.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
this species exists.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm wanting to--

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
what I think I
want to say to you.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why could the
Zorgons be disinformation?

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I have no direct
contact with them.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
The one that I had,
I don't clearly

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:84%
remember because something
went terribly wrong.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's the reason
to find somebody, put it

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
into a strategy
for planet Earth.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm just theorizing.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're cautious
because the Greys may

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
have planted disinformation to
promote reptilian propaganda?

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Possible.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's not only the Greys.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Every kind of military
on this planet

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
would benefit from
a common enemy.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that I
have no direct information

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
or direct contact with
them that I can remember.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I had this one incident.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I do not remember things.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I had some traumatic
experience actually.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But I know people are
talking about that.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
There are people from the
military that actually

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
are claiming that they have
interacted and been in a war

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And also, as far as I know,
the conventional military

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
on Earth right now, not
the secret space force

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
but the conventional
military on Earth,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
is also preparing for
conflict with them

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and also claiming they had
conflict on Earth with them.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where did you hear that
they have conflict with Earth?

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: From a conventional
military source

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:84%
that was claiming that they had
direct encounter in the United

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:90%
States with this species.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If there was an
encounter with the Zorgons,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.205 align:middle line:84%
how would that
play out on Earth?

00:08:49.205 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So, allegedly,
this is a warrior type

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
species that, a, can
move through time just

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.640 align:middle line:90%
as the Greys do.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:84%
They have not come
to the level six

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
being yet because one of
their main "ingredients"

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
or evolutionary
strategies is fear.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
This is something
when they evolve

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
from a reptilian previous
version of what they are now,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:84%
they realized that
fear is something

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:84%
that can be useful
as a defensive

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
but also as an
offensive strategy.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We can see that this is a
strategy in the animal kingdom,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that there are some animals
that use fear in order

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:90%
to protect themselves.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But, usually, they don't use
it as an offensive strategy.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It's more than, a, for example
a small lizard or a snake.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They tend to use this action
in order to scare an opponent.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:84%
But, normally,
they do not use it

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:90%
for aggression but for defense.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And this species seem to
have developed some tactics

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:84%
around fear and
angst, what we call it

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
in German, in order to, yeah,
attack planets and systems.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:90%
So they do it systematically.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Or other ETs involved?

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Or are they watching
this from a distance?

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So as I'm
not a military guy,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I cannot answer that in detail.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I've been
told, these beings, Dracos,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
have been in conflict
with many planets

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.870 align:middle line:90%
and with many star systems.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And there is some kind of
alliance ship to encounter them

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and to fight them back,
which is basically

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
the whole first
order, if we want

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to use this alliance or
the name of the alliance.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So there are two charges
against the Zorgons or Draco

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:90%
by the Greys, which I'm quoting.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:84%
The first charge is
that they violated

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
the law of the
first order by means

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that they enjoy torture, which
means that enjoyment can all

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
only be achieved by breaking
the free will of the victim.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Included in the first charge
is that they also seem

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.660 align:middle line:90%
to be engaged in sex slavery.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
something that happens

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:84%
on this planet in different
ways and is deeply interwoven

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:90%
in the system of planet Earth.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first charge that
the Greys claim against them.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
The second charge
is they are breaking

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
the free will and the free
evolution of subjects.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think as they
gave them an ultimatum

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to remove certain behaviors
on Earth, that runs out.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is why the conflict
is now being hotter than ever.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking for
an exit strategy--

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that I'm
trained on, and it's not too

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
easy for me to articulate
that because those are very,

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:90%
very strong charges--

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that at least this
sexual slavery thing

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.910 align:middle line:84%
could be something that could
be reframed in a positive way.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Though it's still
ugly and heavy.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How can sex slavery be
reframed in a positive manner?

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: This is not
too easy to describe

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.715 align:middle line:84%
because it's totally different
to what cultures on Earth

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:90%
are like.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Normally-- so we know that
this-- or at least the

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
claims that the species
tries to hinder and block

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual evolution
of the earth's people.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And sexuality is something
that is pretty divine.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And divine sexual energy can
be used to elevate the spirits

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and to create the creative
force that is, for example, why

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
the snake is something
as a symbol for DNA

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and for sexual
evolution, which is used

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
all over the place in South
America, in different sites,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:90%
or everywhere.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But the universe
could also use sex

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of pleasureable play.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And within that,
prostitution, for example,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
would be something
that could be allowed;

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
sex slavery if it's consensual,
could be something as an exit

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:90%
strategy that could be allowed.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
The bad thing about torture--
we talked about self-harm.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.822 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.822 --> 00:14:31.040 align:middle line:84%
When it's the way
it is in this case

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that the species needs
the break of the free will

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.090 align:middle line:84%
in order to enjoy
the experience,

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:84%
then we have a problem
because it breaks

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:90%
the free will of the victim.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard
to get around that.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two
charges against the species.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're
charged with that crime.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Has it been decided
what's going to happen?

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: To my knowledge,
to my understanding,

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
the conventional forces
and also some other forces,

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
military forces, are preparing
to fight against them.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And many people have claimed
that this has already been done

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and in progress.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
They also pose
some kind of threat

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
for this planet, which is one
of the many about, I don't know,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
20 reasons why we have
this disclosure so fast

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and so globally because the
worst thing that could happen

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:90%
is an invading species.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And nobody is prepared for that.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So what the Greys are
saying is that they actually

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
want to make them vanish
from this experience

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and bring them somewhere else so
that all the remainings that we

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
have about fear on Earth,
which I mean angst, actually,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and all the installations
that are on Earth

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:90%
are currently being removed.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And that would help and also
the genetic manipulation that we

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:90%
have inside of the human DNA.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So these are things that
seem to have happened.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:84%
From my standpoint, I know
these things are real.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can experience them.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell if the claim and
the species that is charged

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
with is the actual
species that did all this.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I'm
pretty careful.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm not accusing anyone.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying there
are things on Earth that

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:90%
make it really hard to--

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and a really ugly
place in some ways.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is being removed.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
And somebody is
accused for that.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, are humans
capable of defending ourselves

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.420 align:middle line:90%
against these reptilians?

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Or is there an ET
intervention helping us?

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Since humans
have been hand in hand

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
with other warrior
type species, they

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
have found alignship with
these warrior-type species.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So they actually are capable
of defending themselves.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys would always
prefer the involved species

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to defend themselves before
they would do something

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
because they see themselves
as the super revision

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
instance, which means they
come in as the last option.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Humans can defend
themselves, you say.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But if that reptilian race has
the advantage of time travel,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:84%
can't they come back and change
the outcome over and over

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: To my
knowledge, there has

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
been time wars and
manipulation of time strings.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:90%
So at least the Greys--

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there are
any other helpful species.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys did a
lot of remanipulation

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:90%
of the timelines.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And to my knowledge, the
Zorgons or Dracos or whatever,

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:37.430 align:middle line:84%
they went through time in
order to manipulate the outcome

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:90%
of the species of the Earth.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys gave
technology to the humans,

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
who were already
working on time travel

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:90%
since the 1930s or something.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And that technology was given.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They set up a time unit
that observes timelines.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And those time units
are also reaching out

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:90%
to the present time right now.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are the Greys the
only ETs fighting with us?

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Or are others involved,
a federation of ET

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:90%
civilizations possibly?

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So to my
knowledge, I only

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:84%
know about the Earth military
defending the planet.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Those time units are also
working in the present time

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and also in future timelines or
in the future of this timeline,

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a time string, so
many, many timelines.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're working in the
diversity of timelines.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:84%
But it also seemed there
are different members

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
of this first
order that are also

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
involved because they had
their conflicts with the Draco,

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Zorgons.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not privy to that.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where are we
now with this battle?

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
think it will end?

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'm not a
military expert.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm more political
diplomatic being

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that is sitting here and
giving out some information.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So you might want
to ask somebody

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
else on how the military
is doing right now.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
the installation

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
that is placed upon Earth
is being removed right now.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
There have been lots and
lots of military operations

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in this year and
in the last year.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
conventional military

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
is more and more prepared for
the battle; to battle them.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And it has been done.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The US and the UK
and also Russia,

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
they all have set up
their space forces.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Time units are heavily working
on correcting and hitting

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:90%
timelines.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And also, the
Greys are involved,

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:84%
which is the last of all
steps that's been taken.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I think that at some
point or another,

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:84%
some government will
reach out to the public

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:90%
and prepare them for something.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if I'm able
to bring out this information,

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're at least in a more
stable position right now

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:90%
than we have been some time ago.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And I also am hoping
that everything

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:90%
will turn out peacefully.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So where does
this take us, ultimately?

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Does humanity thrive and
join our galactic family

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.682 align:middle line:84%
or stay in this
suppressed state of being?

00:21:50.682 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So one thing that
makes it pretty secure

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:84%
is that we have those time
units, which are reaching out

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
from future events
to the present time

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:90%
and correct things.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're going to have
some kind of knighthood system

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, which means that it
will still be a warrior type

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The military will gain
power over the next years.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We will have a more centralized
governmental administrative

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
system of the
planet so that most

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
of the chaos we have on
this planet will vanish.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I also think that
removing the genetics that

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:84%
block a lot of potential powers
and divinity from the species

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:90%
will help the species to grow.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Other species will
come in the system.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And they will give
strategies and help

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of way or another.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure
that everything

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
has been done that even though
it's a military and warrior

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.670 align:middle line:84%
type species, that
in the end humanity

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
will play a light warrior role,
a good role in the system.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And, again, we have a mental
based, all connected universe.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to
participate in that,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
even though we
don't want to fight,

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
then a very, very
good thing to do

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:84%
is to reach out to
higher frequencies,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:90%
to reach out to higher beings.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, consciously
wise, it's all us.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all us projecting things.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we connect to that
energy and we bring it down

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and there
are lots and lots of species

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and people, and beings,
and individuals doing that,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:90%
then that's good thing.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
In any case, if
anybody doesn't know

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
how to participate
in that, then I

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:84%
follow with what the community
has written in the comments.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Say it out loud possibly every
day, all shift happily now.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, that was
really informative.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's not super
comfortable speaking

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.418 align:middle line:90%
But thank you.

00:24:25.418 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.696 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So installation has
been an artificial set up

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:84%
system on Earth in order
to subjugate and to hinder

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of people.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Chemicals have been involved.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
That's been spread
all over the planet.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Frequencies and
technologies to alter

00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the state of consciousness
in order to bring down.
