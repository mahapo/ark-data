00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on
"Cosmic Disclosure," WE

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:90%
have Sergeant Clifford Stone.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
going over ET species.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Sergeant, welcome to the show.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.935 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD STONE:
Thank you, sir.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.685 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You've been quoted
over the years saying there's

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:90%
over 57 types of ET species.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Can you elaborate on that?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Certainly.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.187 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will criticize
me and say, you know,

00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
if you could say 10 or 12,
we could believe you more.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do they want?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:90%
A fantasy or the truth?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The truth is when I
was in the military,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
there was some
medical personnel who

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.243 align:middle line:84%
would have to provide
first aid for our visitors

00:00:54.243 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
if we got there and
there were some that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:90%
were still alive and injured.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.080 align:middle line:84%
In order to accomplish
that tasking,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
the first aid we do

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be the same for
them, they had a book.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
That book was to tell how
to do certain first aid

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:84%
for certain injuries
on our visitors.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And they had to know what to
do for each and every species.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
That book listed 57
different species.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They were affectionately known--

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:90%
they can laugh if they want to.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We affectionately
called them Heinz 57.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, that
was one of the things

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
that they had to say
about Heinz products.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:90%
So we went ahead, we had that.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't supposed to see it.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
There was no need for
me to know about it.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But one person who was
an officer, and I'm

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:84%
going to say right off
the bat, I don't for sure,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:90%
but he was a doctor.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:90%
We had two medics.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of took
me under their wing

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because they knew I was having
problems with what I was doing.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And they went ahead and
said, OK, look, we're

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:84%
not really trying to do
anything bad to them.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:90%
We just leave them here to die.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, we try not to do that.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are various
species which we are

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
well aware of that you know.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:90%
You may not know how many.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.205 align:middle line:84%
But to date, this is
what we have cataloged.

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
can look at it here.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But we can't let
you have a copy.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
We can't let you
take it with you.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:90%
You can read it but only here.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
If we have other higher
ranking personnel show up,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
sometimes these people
aren't real nice

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and we have to take
the book back from you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and act like you've
never seen it.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And they did this
quite a few times.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd try to go
through a picture and I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
tried to get in my
mind how all 57 looked.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Out of that 57, I had
access to maybe six,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:90%
seven different species.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:84%
The one species that they
had a question mark about

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
was the one species
that was following me

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
throughout my life, whom I still
have contact to this very day.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the
name of this person?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: Well, the
entity that chose

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:10%
me to follow throughout my
life, I know him as Korona.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And he always told
me, Korona with a K.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Where's he from?

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.387 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: He's from
a planet that's

00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
approximately 100 light
years from planet Earth.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you hear me talk
about traversable wormholes,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
whether you're using
negative matter or antimatter

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because they do make
a difference in going

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
through a traversable wormhole.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
If they're using
antimatter, in real time,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
it's an hour and 40 minutes
to get from there to here.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why when I'm using
it to try to show distance,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I use his world to do that
because that's something

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that I have a greater
understanding of with his help.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I ran
into problem with,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
he would not go into too much
detail about negative matter.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
When I found out how much
greater negative matter was,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:90%
But he's one.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:90%
There are other species.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:90%
We have three types of grays.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Two of them are roughly
about 3, 3 and 1/2 feet tall.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Their facial features
are a little different.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The position of their ears
and the shape of their ears

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:90%
are a little different.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:10%
But if you're looking at
them, based on their size,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:10%
you'd think that they
were the same species.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:10%
They're not.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:10%
They are two different
identical species.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:10%
The third one is
roughly four foot tall

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and looks very similar.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Only they are a lighter
gray than the other two.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now is that
one species or is it

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:90%
three different species?

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: That's three
different species.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: But they look similar?

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: They look similar.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: There is another
one that looks kind of human.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But here again,
maybe five foot tall,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:90%
the ears are a little different.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
The nose, there's a
little difference.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But they have like
oriental features.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's really
just small little things.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Little details.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like the details.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing we
utilize in the field

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.165 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials,
they're just off sometimes,

00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit different.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And another
race was the ones

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that are about maybe
3 and 1/2, 4 foot

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:90%
tall who are covered with hair.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
You call them the
hairy guy in Star Wars.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:90%
What was his name?

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, Chewbacca.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: You could call
them little Chewbaccas.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But don't make the
mistake of thinking

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that because they're
small in stature

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.243 align:middle line:90%
that they don't have strength.

00:05:41.243 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Size has no matter.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They can lift up a
6,000 pound vehicle.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:84%
There was an abduction
that took place somewheres

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
in South America, which they
were involved in because they

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
were very concerned
about the radiation

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
still in the atmosphere right
now from nuclear tests that

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:90%
happened 50, 60, 70 years ago.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So there was an abduction
that took place there.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
took place there

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
because the guy
thought they're small.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
He'd just go pick one up,
bring it back to the car.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And when he went to pick
one up, the one that he's

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
trying to pick up,
picked him up and threw

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
him very close to his
car, maybe 10 or 15 feet.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
He didn't go back for a
second try at picking him up.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:90%
That's another species.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Another one is just like,
and I mean, you see them,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:90%
it kind of blows your mind.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking,
well, this is a ghost.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And these are the ones
that are pure energy.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And they can take
on humanoid form.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, they'll
go ahead and they'll

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
be just like a plasmic
cloud of some sort.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And the ones I've seen were
bright light, a bright white,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:90%
had a luminosity from within.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But from that, they could
go on take on human form.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
They will go ahead and
communicate with you

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.087 align:middle line:84%
through what we refer to
it as thought transfer.

00:07:12.087 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people,
well, it's telepathy.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, no matter
what you call it,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
it's a transfer of thought
from their mind to your mind.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And you would hear it like you
and I are talking right now.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And like if you try to
respond, they already

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.828 align:middle line:84%
know what you're going to
say because they've already

00:07:29.828 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:90%
picked up on it.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you do,
you go ahead and translate

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:90%
what they're saying.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you formulate what you're
going to say back to them.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you go ahead
and verbalize it.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the process
you go through.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.893 align:middle line:90%
I would go ahead.

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They already know
what I'm going to say.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But I would still feel
the need to verbalize it.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And they would always
be-- and even the people

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
who were out there in the
field with you who knew,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to talk.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:90%
They already know.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They know everything.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And the whole situation
is I felt that I had to talk.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But people don't
understand that.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
There was another one that
looked very human like.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about them

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't
consider them uniform.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:90%
But I consider them uniforms.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
They have a red type uniform on.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The material, which
is kind of unique,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the grays have one
piece clothing.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
How they get that one piece
clothing on, I have no idea.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.833 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It forms around them.

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well,
that would probably

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:90%
be the best way to put it.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
with these people.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:84%
And they can be anywheres
from roughly five foot

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
tall to a little
over six foot tall.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:90%
But they look just like us.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:90%
How do I put this?

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:90%
They're bold.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Even the females are bold.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:90%
They have no hair whatsoever.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
They can go ahead talk to
you through thought transfer.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Or they can talk to you in
your own language like the way

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.143 align:middle line:90%
we are talking right now.

00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Any language?

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Any language.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: On Earth?

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: On Earth, you
go ahead and name it.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:21.368 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is they can go
ahead and mimic other people.

00:09:21.368 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Like if they want
to get on the phone

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and call someone sound like
me, they could do that.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So the species that I
have come in contact with,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
they have many
different talents.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of the others,
I may have seen one

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
at a distance from
the time I was a kid.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But they can be like
robots but like no robot

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:90%
on the face of this planet.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:84%
They have a
personality about them.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
people will say, well,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
when there's an
abduction going on,

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like there's no care there.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:90%
There's no compassion.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:90%
There's care there.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:90%
There's compassion.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They're doing
everything they can

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.335 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they don't
hurt the individual that they

00:10:14.335 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:90%
are studying.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they're
very much down to business

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to go ahead
and complete what

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
they need to do in the shortest
amount of time as possible.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Are they benevolent?

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I have never
known them to be

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
where they were
violent or hostile

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
or went out of their
way to hurt anyone.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
To be sure, they would
be more astute at letting

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
their own selves get
hurt than hurting us.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Now going back to the
robot type, a lot of people

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and just because
they have robots, well,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
we see them as a mechanical
man or a mechanical person.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the way you
can put this into perspective.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, artificial
intelligence, is it involved?

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard for me to
say they are sentient.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they're
concerned about that time

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.853 align:middle line:90%
when they meet their demise.

00:11:15.853 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In addition to all
these different species,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:84%
people talk about
reptoids and insectoids.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had
experience with that?

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Actually, if you
take a close look at Korona,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and he will tell you in a
joking way, I am not a lizard.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I am not a lizard.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.690 align:middle line:90%
He looks like a reptile.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It does have
that kind of look,

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:90%
like a multifaceted being.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And he has, you
have to look very closely,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
like scales but very thin
texture looking like scales.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Insect like, yes, they
have something like that.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:90%
One that looks very much like--

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and I hate to bring this
out because some people,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and which is really
why I avoid even

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about this
different species.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they have one
species that looks

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:84%
very much like a praying
mantis, even with the arms.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Be very careful
because they don't

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
have the tentacles
like on the arms

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:90%
that the praying mantis has.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Do they have digits?

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: They had digits.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
They were ambidextrous
like this.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.832 align:middle line:84%
So the whole situation
is, yeah, they have that.

00:12:36.832 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them don't have.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:84%
There are plenty
of them that just

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
have three fingers
and an opposing thumb,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better term.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about the
intelligence level, Sarge,

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:90%
of these species?

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Are they greater than us?

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Lower than us?

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
What's kind of the levels
out there in the universe?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They can all
communicate with one another.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But the levels of technological
capabilities, they differ.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because they
don't want to exchange

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.290 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge they have.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they want to
go through a learning process.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's about like we
as adults or as grown ups,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:90%
we can drive a car.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to let our
little six-year-old kids get

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:90%
behind the wheel.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
it's that the progress

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
that each species is at
which they can have access

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:90%
to specific technology.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That makes total sense.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk more about Korona
because this is really

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:90%
fascinating story.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Sarge, what did you
learn about them,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:90%
their species, their culture?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Did they teach you anything?

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's
interesting that you ask.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
say that, when they

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:84%
chose me and they were going
to follow me throughout my life

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and I got to see Korona as he
really looked and was no longer

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
seeing him as a child, I can
remember crying and begging

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
my mom and dad to
take me to the doctor

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
because the doctor could
make the monsters go away.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
At the tender age of seven,
I had to make a decision.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Do I go ahead and fight
what's happening to me?

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
At which time, I'm
going to lose my mind.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be normal.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Or do I go ahead and accept
the fate that's been dealt me

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and learn from it?

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I chose the latter.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:90%
What did I learn?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I learned that our species
that are visiting us,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
they're not cartoon characters
like we most of the time think.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
We see them as will-o-the-wisps
that comes out of the night

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to scare us, the creature
hiding under our beds,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
the creature in the closet.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
They are so much like us.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:90%
They have families.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:90%
They have friends.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:90%
They have likes.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:90%
They have dislikes.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
They really like to share
about their families.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel that I
was ever abducted.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you
right now that I

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
have seen the stars in
such great magnitude,

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
great brilliance that there is
no place on the planet Earth

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that you could ever
see the stars the way

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I saw at that time.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think you were
maybe by locating, abducted,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.335 align:middle line:90%
or having a lucid dream?

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: No.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.206 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel they did at all.

00:15:45.206 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I mean because
when some of this stuff

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:84%
was taking place,
definitely, I was not asleep.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, it was
not an illusion.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.410 align:middle line:84%
They even would make
efforts for me to go ahead.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a
little jewel that I

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
could put in the
palm of my hand,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and I could look at
that jewel, and I

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
could see three dimensionally
the places where they lived.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
You would have some
places that to you

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and I would just
look like a desert.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.867 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This jewel would
make a three dimensional map?

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Would make a
three dimensional map.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.202 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And I could
have it to where

00:16:28.202 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
it would project where it
was a large portion of it

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:90%
right out in front of me.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I had one person that
held it in their hands,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and that was a no no.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They took it back
from me because it

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
sounds so corny when you say
it, because of the vibrations.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But it had to be attuned to
your living force vibration.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.885 align:middle line:90%
Your frequency.

00:16:52.885 --> 00:16:53.685 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:53.685 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's not
attuned to that,

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.523 align:middle line:84%
and then somebody else holds
that, and just looking at it,

00:16:59.523 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:90%
it starts getting hot.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.857 align:middle line:84%
And it will get
to the point where

00:17:01.857 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
it could really cause a very
severe burn onto the person.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
But because I let
somebody else hold it,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.647 align:middle line:84%
a very dear friend of mine, they
said, we need to take it back.

00:17:13.647 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Although, you wouldn't try
to hurt anyone with it,

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:84%
it could hurt someone
and be an accident.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
But you may have a problem
trying to explain it.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:90%
So they went and took it back.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:29.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard for me to
explain the buildings.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But you would have
where using the pen,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
you'd have these tall
buildings that would go up.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Up here, you'd have
maybe a sphere like right

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:90%
here in the middle.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And they'd look like there's
no windows or no nothing.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're inside
the building, it

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
would look like, OK, you're
in a downtown office building.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:84%
They had a means to go
ahead and they could--

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:90%
how do I put this?

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Where we have air
conditioning, we have heaters,

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
they can control to their
satisfaction what's going

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:90%
on in their room, their home.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:90%
They can do this individually.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But if some of them
were cold, they

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:90%
could make themselves warmer.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
If some of them
are too hot, they

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:90%
can make themselves cooler.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Outside, the conditions
can be such they can go

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.028 align:middle line:90%
ahead and regulate the outside.

00:18:30.028 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The environment?

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: The environment
to where it's

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:90%
comfortable for all of them.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.643 align:middle line:84%
Someday, we're going to
have this technology,

00:18:37.643 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:90%
if we don't have it already.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:84%
They are subject to
having severe weather

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
on their own planet,
their own reality.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But the situation
is they can fix it

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to where that severe weather
becomes tame real quick

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:90%
and doesn't cause any damage.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So a hurricane here
could be just completely moved

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.370 align:middle line:90%
to the side?

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.203 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:84%
But now they will also let
this severe weather go on.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you, it's
consistent with our reality.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
they're talking about.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you could stop
a tornado or a hurricane,

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:90%
why not do that?

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Why not just eliminate
it completely?

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to do that.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
their existence.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea why that is.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Someday, we may
learn and understand

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that the adverse weather that
we have here on this planet,

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason,
plays an important role

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.615 align:middle line:90%
in our existence.

00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Do I know what that is now?

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why do you think this?

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They actually
told me that that's now.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, as far as our planet,
they haven't told me that.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I
believe may come about simply

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
because what I've
learned from them.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
could eliminate tornadoes.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
They could eliminate hurricanes
in their environment.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:90%
But they don't.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
They just make sure
that the course they set

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't do any damage
or harm to anyone.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this a
three dimensional being?

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
He can pop in and out like
turning on or off a light.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:90%
But he is physically--

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's
multidimensional.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Mm-hmm.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But he's as physically real as
you and I. You can touch him.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:90%
He can touch you.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
One time, I was very
depressed while I

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
was going through
the problems I was

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:84%
having with the military because
I decided to come out and talk.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was there trying
to convince me, just

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:90%
watch how you're doing this.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you know, I
don't even know if you're real.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Are you a figment
of my imagination?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Am I having mental problems
because I'm seeing you?

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, can mental
problems do this?

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And he picked up a plate,
held it up, dropped it.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:90%
My wife was leaving the kitchen.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And the plate broke.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.990 align:middle line:84%
She turned around,
what are you doing?

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I accidentally
knocked the plate off.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And she turned around
started to leave again.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Then he picked up another
plate, held it up.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Then she turned, and she saw the
plate hanging there in the air.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed a hold of it real
quick and brought it back down.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.937 align:middle line:84%
And she says, was that
plate just in the air?

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:90%
I had my hand on it.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.283 align:middle line:90%
No, you didn't.

00:21:30.283 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, she
doesn't fully understand.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
But she understands
that there is

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
some type of being that comes
into play every now and then.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.095 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
she was thinking it

00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:90%
was like a ghost or something.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And I tried, no, no, no, no, no.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why did he choose
you at such an early age?

00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And are you possibly
part of his lineage?

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They start a process
like when I was four years old,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing what we called
shadow people in my bedroom.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And this scared me.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Then I had other experiences.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'd always associate
these with supernatural events

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:90%
like ghosts.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Then I got to the point where
I could foretell things.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And I got concerned
about that because I

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:90%
had a religious upbringing.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And to me, these were
things that were evil.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: That you're going to
go to hell if you experience

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:90%
this stuff.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:90%
So that had me concerned.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:84%
When I got to being the
age of about six and seven,

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I started to see
these little children.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And they looked very much like
boys and girls my same age.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But they always
cautioned me, don't

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
tell other people about us
because they can't see us.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
OK, this is strange.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, my
family, my mom and dad

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
thought these were just
imaginary friends, playmates.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:90%
But I knew better.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I knew the difference.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happened one day
because I found this little--

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I always loved
helping other animals.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
If I found an animal
or even an insect,

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd try to nurse
them back to health.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But this little bird that
just hatched maybe a day

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
before fell out of its
nest, broke its beak.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I picked up the bird
and I ran home with it.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.467 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was yelling
and the beak was bleeding.

00:23:38.467 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, OK, I'll fix this.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I held it under the water
like if you have a cut,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:84%
you hold your arm under the
water and wash off the blood.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was trying
to do with the bird.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I drowned the poor little bird.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And that broke my heart.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like I killed a person.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:90%
So I was crying.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I felt really bad.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Korona, who'd already
been determined

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
he was the one to follow me
throughout like, now appeared.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And when he appeared, he wasn't
the little sandy headed boy

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:90%
that I knew.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:84%
He now was the green
creature that I gave you

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
a copy of the
artist's conception.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to use the
term freaking out,

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:90%
but he was freaking out.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
way I can put it,

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.495 align:middle line:90%
wanting to know, what are those?

00:24:25.495 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:90%
What's that water in your eyes?

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Why do you feel what you feel?

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do I feel what
you're feeling that way?

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:90%
It was a bird.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:90%
It was a lower form of life.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:90%
You didn't mean to kill it.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Why are you going through this?

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And in short, he
felt that I should

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:84%
be able to rationalize
that it was

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:90%
a bad thing I killed the bird.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But I shouldn't be going through
all the these emotional things.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Now he was
experiencing them too.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, immediately,
from the time

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I saw that, my sorrow for
killing a bird immediately

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:09.290 align:middle line:84%
went to a sense of fear because
this shouldn't be happening.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:90%
This entity should not exist.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I immediately ran and I hid.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:84%
First place I hid was behind
the couch in the front room.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And he looked over,
what are you doing?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I screamed out real
loud and I ran again.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I ran in the kitchen.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:32.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a sink and here
was the refrigerator.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:90%
And back there was a wall.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got back
there because I knew

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
the only way he
could get to me is

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:84%
by coming in where I could see
him, and I could kick at him.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I could push at him,
whatever is necessary.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't get behind me.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
While I was there, I started
feel like his fingers.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And he had three
fingers and a thumb.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I could feel them scratching
on top of my head, so to say,

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:90%
you can run, but you can't hide.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was
getting to the point

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:84%
where, OK, what
am I going to do?

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So my mom was in the
hospital at the time.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:90%
And my aunt was there.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So my aunt made me
sit down because she

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:84%
thought I was acting up
doing bad things I shouldn't

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
be doing.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.952 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for
me to be doing this.

00:26:20.952 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't want
to sit in that chair.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get up.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I had to go find
some place where

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:90%
I felt comfortable and safe.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And that chair wasn't it.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So she stood there and kept
pushing me back in the chair.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, eventually, he came
back to me as a little boy

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and he says, you know, I'm
going to be following you

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:90%
throughout your life.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the way my
species and other species

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
learn about the
way you people live

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, your various
cultures, your likes,

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
your dislikes, your beliefs,
your things, the things

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that you don't believe in,
your fantasies, your hopes,

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:90%
your dreams.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
We want to know all
about your species.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to do it
other than to do it this way.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
We can't come here and say,
take us to your leader,

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:84%
because you have many
leaders on this planet.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:90%
And none are exactly the same.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:90%
So we have to do this.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And you have been chosen
through a select process,

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:41.128 align:middle line:84%
a very selective process to have
me follow you throughout life.

00:27:41.128 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:90%

believe that because

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:84%
of what happened with the
bird, and they were watching,

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and because of your
reaction of being

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:84%
so compassionate as a
human, he came to pick you

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.615 align:middle line:90%
because you have this gift?

00:28:05.615 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Actually,
the compassion

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:14.013 align:middle line:84%
is the one thing they look
for in everyone because each

00:28:14.013 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and every person
they follow, they

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
want that compassion
to be there.

>>STONE: Yes.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, he'll be in
contact with me till the day

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:90%
I die.

>>STONE: Now even
if I don't see him,

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
he's monitoring me
on a daily basis.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:84%
We have interaction
from time to time.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But he is the one that
chooses when that happens.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll even carry it
so far as he knows

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here right now.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.263 align:middle line:84%
And I mean while we may
not be able to see him,

00:28:47.263 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:84%
you may get that
sensation that you feel

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.748 align:middle line:90%
that there's someone else here.

00:28:50.748 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And that happens with
me from time to time.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But then with me, by having
that relationship with him,

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I know it's him.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But the whole situation is,
as far as the number of people

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:84%
out there, I sincerely
believe and feel that number

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.215 align:middle line:90%
could go into the thousands.

00:29:07.215 --> 00:29:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mean
people that are

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:90%
aware of like similar things?

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: That have
been chosen by them

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to be followed because the whole
situation is they don't want

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
just my perspective and
viewpoint on what the United

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.900 align:middle line:90%

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:84%

And it doesn't
matter who you are.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.727 align:middle line:84%
It's just they're choosing
you based off of compassion

00:29:34.727 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%
and love and things.
