00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.910 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:10%
We're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO-ET related

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.760 align:middle line:10%
intelligence.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Today we are discussing the
real William Moore story.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.165 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.125 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, tell us,
Rick, who is William Moore?

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: William Moore.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:84%
what an interesting character
within the UFO community.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:10%
Bill Moore, I call him.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Bill.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Bill was born in
Pennsylvania, October of 1943.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:90%
He had a strange upbringing.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
He had dreams about space,
dreams about little creatures

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:90%
running all over his bed.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
When he was seven years
old, he woke up from dream,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and he saw these
little creatures

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:84%
that were only about 1 to 2
foot tall that were on his bed.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he didn't
know what they were.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And he called them
the little guys.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And they would play with him.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:84%
When he woke up, they would come
into his room and play with him.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So this went on through
his adolescent days

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and then they disappeared,
they didn't come back.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But he was always
interested in--

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
or I should say,
fascinated with space.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Bill always read true magazines.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
He read everything he could
on UFOs back in those days.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
George Adamski's
books, and everything

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:84%
he could get his hands on and
watch everything that was on TV.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
His most favorite
show or movie on TV

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:84%
was The Day the Earth Stood
Still, the 1951 version.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And he would watch that
over and over again as a kid.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
He went to high
school and college

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
at Thiel University
in Pennsylvania,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and then he started teaching
school in Pennsylvania.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:90%
He taught English.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:90%
He met a woman.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:90%
They moved to Minnesota.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
He was still fascinated in
the paranormal, fascinated

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:90%
with UFOs.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
he decided he was

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.080 align:middle line:84%
going to go become a full
time UFO investigator

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and start investigating every
one of these claims made

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:90%
by other people regarding UFOs.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
The first thing he saw
once in a magazine was--

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
he saw a picture of
the USS Eldridge.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, remember what happened.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
The legend is that 1943--

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
remember, that's the
same year Bill was born,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
the USS Eldridge had
an incident that caused

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:90%
the USS Eldridge to disappear.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:84%
He saw a small article
about it, and then he

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
saw the picture of
the USS Eldridge.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
he decided he was

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:90%
going to write a book about it.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So over a period of a
good year, he researched

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:90%
everything he could do--

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
everything he could find on the
USS Eldridge and that incident.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up writing
the book, The Philadelphia

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Experiment.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:10%
And it was somewhat of a hit.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:10%
And sometime later, he
got with Stan Friedman.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:10%
And Stan Friedman, who
most UFO followers knew,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:10%
unfortunately, Stan
passed away, but Stan

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:10%
had some information
about the Roswell case

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:10%
that Bill had never heard.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And Bill thought there
wasn't enough information

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to write a book about
the Roswell case.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:10%
But enter Berlitz,
he had information

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:10%
about the Roswell case.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:10%
So they got together and
Bill, over an 18-month period,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:10%
researched the Roswell case.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And the first book on the
Roswell incident came out.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, Bill had a lot of good
information in that book,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
but he also had some
information in that book

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
that the government didn't
want him to have in that book.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
And so prior to him
writing the book

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
the US intelligence got
hold of Bill and said,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
listen, Bill, we don't want
you to write this, this

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:90%
and this in a book.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
We want to-- keep
that stuff out of it.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And in for you doing that
we're going to employ you.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%
So for the first--

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
before my contact
with Bill Moore,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Bill Moore was working for US
intelligence, but not the arena

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs, but we knew,
the US intelligence

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.830 align:middle line:84%
knew that Bill had contacts with
scientists inside the Soviet

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Union.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:90%
And this is in the late 70s.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And Bill was corresponding
with one particular scientist

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
inside the Soviet Union who was
involved in the Soviet Academy

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:90%
of Science.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.623 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:05:04.623 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, obviously, the
CIA is very interested in that,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
very interested
in that scientist,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
very interested in what
the scientists knew

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and the correspondence
that was being

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
transmitted between that
scientist and Bill Moore.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So US intelligence got involved
and they were telling Bill,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is what we
want you to write,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.370 align:middle line:84%
this is what we
want you to send him

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
we want you to ask.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what Bill
didn't realize was

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
we had spies inside the
Soviet Union at the time,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and we had a deep
covert operative

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:90%
that also knew this scientist.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.028 align:middle line:84%
So when Bill was corresponding
with the scientist in a letter--

00:05:49.028 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, letters, right.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: This other deep cover
operative inside the Soviet

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Union was giving this scientist
something to send back

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:90%
to Bill in a cryptic manner.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Secret writings
and spy material.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that was going on
for a long period of time.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And then enter Special
Agent Richard Doty.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in an operation
to penetrate UFO groups.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And who was the best person
I could think of or in US

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
intelligence could
think of, to recruit

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:90%
to penetrate UFO community?

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And that was Bill Moore.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I was given an operational plan.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:90%
And we knew what Bill's--

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
because he was already
talking to the CIA,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
we knew what his
travel itinerary was.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So Bill was coming to
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
to speak and promote
his book The Roswell

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Incident on a local
television station

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:90%
and on a local radio station.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The television station
interview was canceled,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
but the radio interview
was still going on.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:84%
We had contacts with
in every single news

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
media in Albuquerque,
and that was

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
part of counterintelligence
operations.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted a person
within the radio, KOB radio,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and I said, you're going
to have Bill Moore tomorrow

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:90%
at whatever time it was.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we are.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want a
copy of the recording

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:90%
and plus, I'm going to meet him.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, nobody had
cell phones back then.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.853 align:middle line:84%
I said, when you
first meet Bill,

00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I want you to give
him this phone number

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and tell him to call.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And the contact says,
absolutely, we'll do that.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So when Bill got to the radio
station, I was at my office.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:90%
The phone call came in.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this Bill
Moore, who is this?

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.908 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is Special
Agent Richard Doty

00:07:56.908 --> 00:07:59.075 align:middle line:84%
with the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you
told him right up.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.593 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right off the bat.

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:90%
No hiding or anything.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Bill,
welcome to Albuquerque.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:90%
He said, hmm.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So Bill knew his
contact within the CIA,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and he figured that
I was just posing

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
as somebody other than the CIA,
but he figured I was CIA, too.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And Bill said, yeah,
what do we need--

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:90%
what do you need?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, I need to have lunch
with you after your interview.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I'll come by the train
station, pick you up.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Bill said, no, I
got a rental car.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:90%
I said, right, fine.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll meet at a
certain restaurant.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, that restaurant we were
meeting at, we literally--

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not exaggerating,
US intelligence

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
owned that restaurant
and everybody in there

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
was not necessarily
intelligence officers,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
but they were working for an
entity that we were controlling.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's voice recording
devices and cameras

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, I met him there.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.740 align:middle line:84%
I introduced myself and
asked him about himself

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and he tells me his story.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm interested
in the Roswell book,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking and
we're having lunch.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
quizzical with me

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
because he thought, you
got another agenda here,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Doty, it's not--

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you--

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:84%
after we had dinner
or lunch Bill says,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:90%
do you want something from me?

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, I do, but we
can talk about it outside.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So we went outside
and there's a--

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.592 align:middle line:84%
there's a walkway that led
to some other little cafes

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
because this is right across
the street from the University

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:90%
of New Mexico.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's got all those
little corridors and all

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.648 align:middle line:90%
that, it's very quaint.

00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And we were
walking and I said, Bill--

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, and I
named his CIA handler.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:90%
I said, so and so.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Bill says, yeah.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:90%
He said, you work with him?

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.778 align:middle line:84%
He said, so what do-- you want
me to send another letter?

00:10:01.778 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Nothing about that, Bill.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do
something else for us.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And this time you'll
be working for me.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:90%
And Bill says, what is it?

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I just want
you to get some information

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
for me regarding some UFO
data that's being stored by--

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:90%
or in possession of NICAP.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
NICAP was-- Bill was involved
with NICAP and APROBAC

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.990 align:middle line:90%
back in those days.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.907 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the audience,
Rick, what's NICAP?

00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: NICAP is a
National Investigative

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.755 align:middle line:90%
Committee for Aerial Phenomena.

00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:37.555 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:10:37.555 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was a UFO group that
stored and collected information

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and reports on-- civilian
agency that reported

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.393 align:middle line:84%
and collected data on UFO
sightings or any activity.

00:10:50.393 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And he's directly
involved with them.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He is a member--

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A member.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --of NICAP.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:84%
NICAP was getting
information from somebody

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:90%
that was quite credible.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:08.642 align:middle line:84%
I should say not only credible,
but involving national security.

00:11:08.642 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was a possible
leak you're telling me?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was a
leak, and we wanted

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Bill to try to penetrate
and get information.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:90%
But I told Bill, Bill--

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, listen, Bill,
there's two people in NICAP

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that I want you to just talk to
and get some information from.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that for us?

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And Bill says,
well, I don't know.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, we'll pay you.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the
information you can get for me.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And now remember, at this
time, Bill did not have a job.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.215 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Bill left
his teaching job.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Arizona,
Prescott, Arizona.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
He had a wife and two
children at that time.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
The other one wasn't born
for another year later.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was researching, and he
got money from The Philadelphia

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Experiment.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But it would be nice for him
to be paid something else.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And Bill thought about
it and he said, well,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
let me get back
with you on that.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what, Bil?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
I need an answer now.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
OK, I'll do it.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And that began a long
term relationship

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.425 align:middle line:90%
between Bill Moore and myself.

00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Rick,
what kind of things

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.185 align:middle line:84%
were you trying to
get Mr. Moore to do?

00:12:24.185 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No matter what task
I gave Bill, he completed it.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It was not just NICAP.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It was some of the
other UFO groups.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to penetrate
these groups because Bill

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Moore's name was prominent
within the UFO community

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
in the 70s because he
put himself in there.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
best agent or asset

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
you could have within a group
that you're trying to penetrate,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who's
already in there, not

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
from somebody from
the outside that's

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.742 align:middle line:90%
trying to get in the group.

00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Somebody is already in there.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm sure these
organizations also

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:84%
wanted him part of
their organizations

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:90%
because of who he was.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:84%
The book, The
Philadelphia Experiment,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
the new book The Roswell
Incident that just came out,

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:90%
they loved him.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they opened
the door for him.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So were you trying
to get information from Moore

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
about the individuals
that are working

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
in these groups or the
individuals that are leaking

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:90%
information in the groups?

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We wanted
everything Bill could

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
get from the group,
both information

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
they were receiving
from private citizens

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and what information
they were getting

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:90%
from government personnel.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:90%
And here is the reason.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
These UFO groups
back in those days,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't cell
phones or anything,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
these people were sending
letters or calling a number

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and providing information
or data about sightings.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to know where these
sightings were happening.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
We wanted knowing what
these civilians were

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:90%
telling this civilian group.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have access to that.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:84%
We only had access to what
the military personnel

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:90%
were telling us.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The civilians,
every now and then

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
they might call
an Air Force base

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and say something,
because remember,

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Blue Book was
closed at that time,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't any
other reporting system.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:90%
But these private--

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Organizations
were the go to.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: These UFO
groups were the go to.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we wanted to
keep track of everything

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that these civilians
were telling the group.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And so Bill set up a system
inside each one of these groups

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to report any
information pertaining

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
to not just the sighting
of something in the sky,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
but something with substantial
information or evidentiary

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
value that would be interested--
interesting to the government.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Bill set up a system by himself.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.515 align:middle line:90%
So innovative.

00:15:03.515 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: So innovative.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And he was constantly--
in fact, he

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
was giving us so
much information

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't
handle it by myself.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
There would have-- there
were two other agents

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and an administrative assistant,
what we call an intelligence

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
analyst, to collect the
data that he was giving us.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And what we were doing
with it is we were plotting

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and then we were sending reports
back up to our headquarters

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and also to DIA, and DIA would
use it for other reasons.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So Bill was the
conduit that we used

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
to get literally
hundreds of reports

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't have
been able to get.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what were you
getting from civilians

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.095 align:middle line:84%
that the government
themselves couldn't get?

00:15:54.095 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, one
thing we were getting

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:84%
was research and
development crafts that

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:90%
were flying in certain areas.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:84%
We knew they were
up there, but we

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
didn't know how many civilians
were seeing these things,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and what were the reaction of
these civilians to these crafts

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that we were flying.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The F-117 and some of
these other crafts,

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:90%
the Aurora, the TR-3s.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to know where these
things were being sighted.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of the information,
I would say probably

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
60% of the information
that Bill was given to us,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:84%
were easily identifiable,
other objects, space objects

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:90%
or atmospheric anomalies.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But the 40% that we
were getting were really

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
good sightings of these
classified aircrafts

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%
that were flying.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And these classified aircrafts
weren't only flying out

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
of Groom Lake in
and around Nevada,

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:90%
but they would fly overseas.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
They would be on missions into
Canada or over the Pacific

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, did you
allow him to know this?

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
Was he privy to that
information or you just kept it?

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.876 align:middle line:84%
You just said, oh, we're just
investigating these UAPs?

00:17:15.876 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No, Bill, never--

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:90%
it was only one way--

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:90%
it's always one way.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.264 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:17:22.264 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He gave us
the information.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That was it.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.105 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And we gave him money.

00:17:26.105 --> 00:17:26.905 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Got it.

00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So he was doing
it for pay and prestige

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
because he was good
at what he was doing.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:90%
He was the best.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
There were no other--
and we had other assets.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Other agents
at other bases

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
had assets within
the UFO groups,

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't very good.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the
clout that Bill Moore

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:90%
had with these UFO groups.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And Bill, number one,
was an excellent speaker.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
He was very smart,
very intelligent man.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
He had an excellent
reasoning ability

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and he could portray things
to people that they might not

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:90%
normally would do.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So he could trick people
into doing things.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was still involved
in the Soviet operation,

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but he was also
involved with us.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:26.165 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of many things
Bill did for US intelligence.

00:18:26.165 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what other
case did you task Bill for?

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: The Paul Bennewitz case.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, Paul knew Bill Moore.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know him well enough
to call him on a telephone,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:90%
but knew of him.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And Paul had read both The
Philadelphia Experiment

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and The Roswell Incident,
so he knew of Bill more.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:84%
We thought during the early
stages of the Paul Bennewitz

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
case that we would bring in Bill
to introduce himself to Paul,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to see if Paul would tell Bill
certain things that he wouldn't

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:90%
tell me.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, this is in
the early stages of the Paul

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Bennewitz investigation.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Probably know me before, and
we're talking a few months

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:90%
into the investigation.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But he knew a Bill because
he had mentioned Bill Moore,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the books
on Paul's desk

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
in his bookcase, The
Philadelphia Experiment

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and The Roswell Case.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, hmm.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So I talked it over
with my supervisors

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I think we should
bring Bill Moore in just

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.855 align:middle line:84%
to make him have contact with
Paul to see what happens.

00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:38.285 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the viewers, what
is the Paul Bennewitz case file?

00:19:38.285 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: OK, Paul Bennewitz
was a civilian scientist.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:10%
He had a government contract.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:10%
He had his own company
called Thunder Scientific,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:10%
which was just outside
Kirtland Air Force base.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Paul tapped into some highly
classified programs on Kirtland

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Air Force base, and we
started a counterintelligence

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:90%
investigation on Paul Bennewitz.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We wanted to know how
he got the information that

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:90%
is classified.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:90%
So we brought in Bill Moore.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Bill Moore called him one day
and said, hey, I'm Bill Moore.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I understand you have a business
right outside Kirtland Air Force

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:84%
base, Thunder scientific, and
that you are a fan of mine.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.972 align:middle line:90%
And Paul was somewhat shocked.

00:20:28.972 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:84%
At first Paul didn't
believe it was Bill Moore,

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
and Bill had to
convince him it was.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And Bill says, I
can come right now.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Albuquerque.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So he said, well,
come out to my office.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So he goes out to the
Thunder Scientific

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%
and Bill introduces himself.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:90%
He brings two books.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Paul
already has the books,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
but he gave Paul signed copies,
and he just got to know Paul.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.385 align:middle line:84%
What kind of business
do you have here?

00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And so forth and so on.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And then Paul, without
any prodding from Bill,

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:84%
immediately started telling
Bill about what was occurring

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:90%
on Kirtland Air Force base.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And Bill, he didn't know exactly
what Paul had delved into,

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:84%
but Bill says, well, what
are you talking about?

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And then Paul laid it all out.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And now Bill thought
that Paul was

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.715 align:middle line:84%
relating classified
information because his--

00:21:26.715 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz's company was
dealing in classified projects

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:90%
for DARPA.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And so Bill was hesitant to get
any more information from Paul.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:90%
But Paul volunteered it.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Hey, come out to my house.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you how to do it.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:90%
We do it.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And he did that.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Paul showed him how he
photographed these objects

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:84%
over Kirtland Air
Force base, how

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
he tapped into this unique
signal frequency, and all

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, immediately the next
day, Bill calls me and says,

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I got to talk to you.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So I meet Bill at a secure
location off the base.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:90%
We had a number of safe places.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.458 align:middle line:90%
And Bill says, this guy is nuts.

00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:90%
He says, he told me everything.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I think he's telling
me classified stuff.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are
you talking about?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:90%
And he tells me--

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Bill tells me everything
that Paul had told him.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, well.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, Bill, I want you to
go back wearing a wire.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.890 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear it everything--

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.257 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --that
Paul's telling you.

00:22:35.257 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:90%
So we set him up with a wire.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Bill calls.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it was like, the
following Monday or something

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:90%
to that effect.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, yeah, yeah.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Come on out.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So he goes out first to the
Thunder Scientific laboratories

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:90%
and Paul gave him a tour.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And now there are
classified things

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that Thunder Scientific
makes, like the humidity

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
sensors for submarines,
a particular component

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:90%
inside a nuclear weapon.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:90%
But Paul didn't talk about that.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.770 align:middle line:84%
He was very careful
not to show him that.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But he did say
that room in there,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:84%
everything we do in there
is highly classified.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't take you in there.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So now Bill basically
tells if Bill was a spy,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's where I
have to go into and get

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:90%
whatever one of those things.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And then that night Paul
took Bill out to the house

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:84%
again for dinner and
went back up and started.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So we have hours of
Paul explaining to Bill

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stuff that
he wasn't supposed to.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So Bill turns everything over
to us, and then of course

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.645 align:middle line:84%
we confront Paul later
and read him the Riot Act.

00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:53.445 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:23:53.445 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Anyways.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
What Bill did was he
maintained contact with Paul,

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and he wasn't supposed to.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know what, you
need to get out of dodge.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you to be burdened
by the Paul Bennewitz case.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:90%
So just get out of there.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the
meantime, Leo Sprinkle

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:84%
calls Bill Moore
up and says, hey,

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I hear you're in Albuquerque.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And Bill says, well,
how do you know I'm

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:90%
at this hotel in Albuquerque?

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Paul Bennewitz told me.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Paul Bennewitz told you?

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I understand you've been
spending a few days with him.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:84%
He said-- Bill says, well,
yeah, but he told you this?

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Leo says.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And Leo says, I'm
here with Allen Hynek,

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to meet with Paul

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.563 align:middle line:84%
and can we get
together beforehand.

00:24:46.563 --> 00:24:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, for
the audience, can you

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:84%
tell everyone who Leo Sprinkle
is, and of course, Allen Hynek?

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Yeah, Leo Sprinkle
is a UFO investigator,

00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:10%
a psychologist, and he
investigated abductions,

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:10%
wrote some books about UFOs.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:10%
Allen Hynek is a
doctor, a scientist.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:10%
He was involved intimately
with the Project Blue Book

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:10%
and also the ending of Project
Blue Book, the Candem report.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
He provided information
to Candem that

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:90%
ended up in the Candem report.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But Allen Hynek is probably
famous for being in Close

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Encounters of the Third Kind.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:90%
He's actually in that film.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's who they are.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:90%
So they came to talk to Paul.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Bill Moore intercepted
him before--

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:84%
actually, the night before
at a hotel in Albuquerque.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And Bill wanted to know
what they were doing there.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:90%
And Allan said, we have--

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
have a monitor, a
computer monitor

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to give Paul.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And Bill says, why would
you want to do that?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, Paul is
involved in this case

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:84%
where he's in contact
with extraterrestrials

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and we want to give him
this newer model monitor

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:90%
so he could collect more data.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, this came out in a
number of different venues

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.450 align:middle line:84%
over the years,
but nobody actually

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:84%
knew how we knew that Hynek gave
Paul this monitor beforehand.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
Bill Moore told us.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And Leo Sprinkle was there
because of Myrna Hansen.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:90%
She was an abductee that was--

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz was
going to try to finance

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:90%
some of the things for her.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
She was abducted in Northern
New Mexico some time before.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.880 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, the
night before they

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
were going to give
Paul the monitor

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and talk to Paul
about Myrna Hansen.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Paul called me, but
I wasn't available.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I had an answering machine,
and he left his message

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:90%
on the answering machine.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And then late at
night, Bill calls me.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
He says, I've got
to talk to you.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We got a problem
with Paul Bennewitz.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's 11:00 at night.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.050 align:middle line:90%
What kind of problem do we have?

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.760 align:middle line:90%
He said, I need to talk to you.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, I'll go.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But just before I left, I
saw that there was a message.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:90%
So I hit the message.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's Paul.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And Paul tells me, I need to see
you tomorrow afternoon, Rick.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:90%
He called me Richard.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I go out and meet Bill
at an all night restaurant

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
on Central Avenue and not
in a very good district.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I know.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Albuquerque between
Wyoming, Louisiana, and I

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:90%
said, yeah, what do you want?

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, Allen Hynek
and Leo Sprinkle

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:90%
are here to see Paul Bennewitz.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, first of
all, I had no idea who

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Leo Sprinkle was at that time.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I said, who are they?

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, you don't
know who they are?

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I think I've heard
of Hynek, but I don't

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.100 align:middle line:90%
know who is this other guy.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And then Bill explains
to who he was.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what do they
to talk to Paul about?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.390 align:middle line:84%
They have a computer that
they're going to give him.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:90%
So the bells go off.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, a computer.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.892 align:middle line:90%
Now, he says, a computer.

00:28:31.892 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, all right,
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I want you to call
Paul tomorrow afternoon and set

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.940 align:middle line:84%
up an appointment just
between you and Paul.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Bill says, OK.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you
information to tell Paul.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.195 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next--
then I go back--

00:28:53.195 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and the next morning, I
get up and go to the office

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and I call Paul because he had
called me the night before.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.067 align:middle line:90%
I say, Paul.

00:28:59.067 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Richard, what do you need?

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, I need to talk
to you this afternoon.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, what time?

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:90%
4:00.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, no problem.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So he said, but I want to
see you at my business,

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:90%
not at my home.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.360 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.610 align:middle line:90%
So I go see Paul.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And Paul says, I think.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.375 align:middle line:90%
Bill Moore is a spy.

00:29:20.375 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Whoa.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.155 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, we're
in his office.

00:29:24.155 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This is great.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And it's just him and I.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, him and I and
a bug that we put in there.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And I said, a spy?

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah, he's a spy.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, why-- why
do you say that?

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, because he's
reporting to somebody on me.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:90%
I said, why do you say that?

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know,
I know, Richard.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, Paul has a temper.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And of course, he's
chain smoking cigarettes.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, gosh.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I said,
well, calm down, Paul.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, so you think Bill
Moore is a spy, for who?

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:90%
The Soviets.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:84%
He's been in my laboratory
and he just goes on and on.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it's
you the whole time.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.188 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's me all the time.

00:30:08.188 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:90%
So I don't say anything to him.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the subject of the computer
and the monitor never comes.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Never comes up.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so I thought,
well, you know what?

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Paul, I'm going to
investigate that.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:22.852 align:middle line:90%
He said, you need to arrest him.

00:30:22.852 --> 00:30:23.810 align:middle line:90%
You need to arrest him.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We can't
just arrest a spy.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We got to-- we got to
build a case on him.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, so I need you to
maintain contact with him.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Perfect.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So he said,
OK, I'll collect.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll collect the information.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So now we have what we refer to
in the intelligence community

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:90%
as a daisy chain, you know.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So about a week later,
or maybe more than that,

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I go to Paul's house.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking to Paul
and collecting the data

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:84%
that we had-- we were collecting
there and I see this monitor

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that it wasn't
the same brand as the other one.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you
buy a new monitor?

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.993 align:middle line:90%
Allen Hynek gave it to me.

00:31:10.993 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ooh.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.610 align:middle line:90%
I feel it's going--

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I said--

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --Allen Hynek
brought this to you?

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:17.712 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:31:17.712 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He said, yeah.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, did Bill Moore have
anything to do with this?

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Bill
did, which Bill didn't.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He said,
also Leo Sprinkle.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, who is this
Leo Sprinkle guy?

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And he tells me.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.763 align:middle line:84%
He says, well you know
about Myrna Hansen, right?

00:31:34.763 --> 00:31:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I have no idea
who you're talking about.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, she's an
abductee that's

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:84%
been out at Kirtland Air
Force base underground

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:90%
where the aliens are.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, OK.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Paul, you can tell me
about that in a bit,

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.710 align:middle line:84%
but I'm worried about
your monitor over here,

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Hynek gave that to you.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, we ended up getting
our technical people out--

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Jessica, who's-- she was an
agent, but she's a computer wiz.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:84%
She came out, take
the computer--

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.403 align:middle line:90%
monitor back, tear apart.

00:32:01.403 --> 00:32:02.695 align:middle line:90%
It was-- it was just a monitor.

00:32:02.695 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Really?

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There wasn't
anything in it.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And so now I could contact
Jerry Brown, FBI, and I said,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do something
about this Allen Hynek

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:90%
guy in this Leo Sprinkle.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
about Bill Moore?

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:90%
I said, Bill Moore?

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Jerry, how did Bill
Moore-- now, Jerry Brown

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.600 align:middle line:84%
was an FBI foreign
counterintelligence specialist.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
We worked-- I worked
with him all the time.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of espionage
in the United States

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.500 align:middle line:90%
is the FBI's purview.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And we had cases that were
running together and so forth.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we got a call,
an anonymous call here

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:90%
at our office about Bill Moore.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, uh, let me come
down and explain it to you.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So we go down and I explain
and we get on a special system

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and I say, check this number
because all our assets have

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:58.530 align:middle line:90%
a number.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's working for us.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.727 align:middle line:90%
This guy called.

00:33:01.727 --> 00:33:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I said the guy who called
is Bill, Paul Bennewitz,

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.320 align:middle line:90%
As I said, it's a cluster.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So anyway,
Jerry and I went out

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to where Leo and Allen Hynek
were staying in a hotel,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:90%
and we read him the Riot Act.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jerry read
it the Riot Act.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Jerry said, you know what?

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.540 align:middle line:84%
You guys go and contact
Paul Bennewitz again,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.165 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a
federal restaurant.

00:33:30.165 --> 00:33:31.135 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Jerry says, I might just
go ahead and seize everything

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in this room and going
to get a warrant.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it scared
them and they left.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, I get billed
to work against Paul

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.690 align:middle line:90%
without Paul knowing--

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:84%
because Paul thinks
he's collecting on Bill

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:48.930 align:middle line:90%
because he's a spy.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.665 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And technically.

00:33:50.665 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He is.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Bill is a spy.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: For us.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: For us.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, that carried on into--

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and then from that point,
enter Jaime Shandera.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who's that?

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.310 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Jaime Shandera
received a package in the mail.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.039 align:middle line:10%
Ended up to be the
MJ-12 documents.

00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:08.839 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:10.489 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He gave
them to Bill Moore.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Bill Moore circulated
it to some people

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:17.080 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out if they're
accurate or legitimate or not.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.492 align:middle line:84%
They then went out
to other people

00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't have
any internet back then.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how the MJ-12
documents came into existence.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.023 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on,
they were circulated

00:34:29.023 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're still
on the internet.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, still there.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.575 align:middle line:90%
Were those documents legitimate?

00:34:32.575 --> 00:34:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, you know, I
didn't generate them, but we--

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.520 align:middle line:90%
pretty sure we know who did.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were generated
within the government

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:45.690 align:middle line:84%
by the Defense Intelligence
Agency Special Means Committee.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they're probably half the
truth and half disinformation.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.402 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:34:51.402 --> 00:34:54.994 align:middle line:84%
What was the intention
of that being released?

00:34:54.994 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Flooding the
market, so to speak.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because everyone-- every
UFO group got a copy of this.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
thinking that everything

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that's in this
document is factual

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:90%
because it came from Bill Moor.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so they're spreading
this disinformation out there.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, probably some of that,
those documents, information

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:90%
in there is factual.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%
But most of it's not.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So the disinformation
is spread through just

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:90%
like a virus being spread.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was a goal of
the MJ-12 documents,

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
was spreading that
disinformation

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.825 align:middle line:90%
through the UFO groups.

00:35:28.825 --> 00:35:30.575 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, what
was the point of that?

00:35:30.575 --> 00:35:33.830 align:middle line:84%
- Well, remember, the UFO
groups were getting information

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.460 align:middle line:90%
from government sources.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:90%
If we give them all this--

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:84%
give these groups
all this information

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and some of the information
doesn't coincide

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.660 align:middle line:84%
with what this
government guy is given,

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.690 align:middle line:84%
now you're flooding the
market, so to speak.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You're confusing the
UFO groups and they

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:90%
don't know which way to turn.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly the way
the government wanted it.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're using
Bill for information

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.390 align:middle line:90%
and disinformation.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.650 align:middle line:90%
At what point did these collide?

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And what was the result of that?

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, Bill became
a maverick, so to speak.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And he went out on
his own and did things

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't ask him to do.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And we had a rainy man in 1988.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: A rainy man who told
him, you're no longer working

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.430 align:middle line:84%
for the government,
and everything that you

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:22.520 align:middle line:84%
did for US is still sensitive
and you can't report it.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, a year
later, in 1989, Bill Moore

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.940 align:middle line:84%
made his famous speech
at a UFO convention

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:84%
telling the audience that he
worked for the Air Force Office

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:90%
of Special Investigations.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.650 align:middle line:84%
He was being paid to
provide disinformation

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.580 align:middle line:90%
to every one of the UFO groups.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- if security
hadn't been present,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:84%
he would have
probably been hung.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And he got out of the
UFO business after that.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:57.295 align:middle line:84%
And he-- some people don't
even know where he's at today.

00:36:57.295 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, what lessons can
be learned about Moore's story,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, with the intersection
of all the government activities

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and the civilian research?

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, Bill Moore
was a very important asset

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.860 align:middle line:84%
for the United States government
for a number of years.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But then he decided that he was
going to go out and do things

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't--

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:84%
missions that he wasn't allowed
to do or wasn't told to do.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And he ruined his
own credibility

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
by collecting data that
he shouldn't have had

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and making contact
with people he

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have ever contacted.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So he ruined his own
career in US intelligence.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.565 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you think
he whistleblowed on himself?

00:37:40.565 --> 00:37:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He wanted to get out.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
That was a way for
him to get out.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I met with him right before.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
He didn't tell me he was
going to give that speech,

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:90%
but I was there.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I was in the second row.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:84%
He told me he was
going to give a speech

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to get
out of the business.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.535 align:middle line:84%
And that speech certainly
kicked him out of the business.

00:37:59.535 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So do you see any
parallels between the work

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that Moore did and of course,
all the work that you did?

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.620 align:middle line:84%
He collected data,
he distributed it.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:84%
It was our job to recruit
as many assets as we could.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.050 align:middle line:90%
He was an asset.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:90%
He did his job.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.590 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, for
a good number of years,

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.920 align:middle line:84%
he did exactly what he was told
to do, how he was told to do it,

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.928 align:middle line:84%
when he was told to
do it and collected

00:38:26.928 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:90%
the information that we needed.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.928 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's your
motivation for being

00:38:29.928 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:90%
here at this time, Rick?

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.405 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I want disclosure.

00:38:32.405 --> 00:38:33.215 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Hmm.

00:38:33.215 --> 00:38:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.832 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I've been fighting
for disclosure for 22 years,

00:38:35.832 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:90%
just like everyone else is.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I figure if I come out and
tell the absolute truth of what

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I did during my time
in US intelligence,

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that maybe that will
open up some doors

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:84%
for either other people
or the government

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to come clean on what they
know about the United States

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:84%
government involvement
with extraterrestrials,

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.428 align:middle line:84%
the UAP and UFO program
within the government.

00:38:58.428 --> 00:38:59.595 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I'm doing it.

00:38:59.595 --> 00:39:01.637 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
believe this disclosure will

00:39:01.637 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:90%
do for people, Rick?

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Enlighten them,
make them understand

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.060 align:middle line:84%
that what was occurring
during those days

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.880 align:middle line:84%
where the government was
hiding facts from us.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And we want-- and I'm
part of the public.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer employed by the
United States intelligence

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:90%
service.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.705 align:middle line:84%
And I want disclosures
just as much as everybody

00:39:21.705 --> 00:39:22.505 align:middle line:90%
out there does.

00:39:22.505 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And do you feel that
other people are coming forward

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that have similar
backgrounds that you have?

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Absolutely.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're coming
out every single day.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.368 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, they are.

00:39:33.368 --> 00:39:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I'm
encouraging them to do.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot--

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:90%
waiting to come out.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I'm
trying to influence

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:84%
them to not just come out, but
to come on Cosmic Disclosure

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:90%
to tell their story.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, we really appreciate that.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that's
happening every day too.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Rick, I want to thank you
for being on the show.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
