00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:21.700 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by
Victoria Whitney,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:10%
a Doctor of Science and a
retired member of the United

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
States Navy
Department of Defense.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
She has worked as an
environmental engineer

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
and scientist in special
programs and projects

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:10%
and is an expert in
extraterrestrial and crash site

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:10%
investigations.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll be discussing
her first contact experience.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome to the show.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> VICTORIA WHITNEY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So let's talk a
little bit about yourself,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.472 align:middle line:84%
first of all, so the audience
gets to know who you are.

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about
your experience

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
in the DoD and your
first contact experience.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Sure.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I worked for the Department of
Defense, US Navy, for 15 years.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.057 align:middle line:84%
What I did for them was
a lot of water quality

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:84%
since we're on the
Marine environment.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Fun.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: And I was fortunate
enough to work on a lot

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
of special projects, which
allowed me to see the Marine

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:90%
environment in a different way.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I never
really had any contact

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:84%
in the shipyard where we
worked, but as time went on,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:90%
that changed.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very personal
contact waiting for the bus

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
one morning.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at that time, we
had no cameras in the shipyard.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
You could not take
a picture, so I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
didn't get a chance to do that.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
But we watched for 42
minutes while a very large

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:84%
black triangular ship went over
the shipyard, the entire thing.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We could tell that they were
monitoring because we could

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:90%
see a beam coming down from it.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It looked like
particles coming down.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
We could see that something
was being returned to the ship.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And like I say,
it was 42 minutes.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We could see portals
on the outside.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
We could see that there
were live beings looking out

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:90%
those portals.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So this wasn't a
reverse-engineered Navy craft.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:90%
This was--

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: This was an actual--

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
it had symbols on the side
of it that I couldn't even

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:90%
tell you what they said.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, when it
finished what it was doing

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and security came,
as they should have,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:84%
we were told afterwards
not to discuss this.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But at one point, the
ship decided it was done

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:90%
and was gone just like that.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you know
why they were there?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a scrap yard.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I've been on Navy ship--

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.773 align:middle line:90%
Navy bases with scrap yards.

00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's many different
things that could be on there--

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.495 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:29.662 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --that are secret.

00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah, I think it was
interesting because they scanned

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:90%
all of the ships.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:90%
This is a surface shipyard.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:90%
They scanned all of the ships.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Several of them are
nuclear vessels.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty sure that's
what they were looking for.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They started scanning
several of the buildings.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.888 align:middle line:84%
And same thing, I
think they were looking

00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
for nuclear-type material.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:90%
You never really know.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, it took
them 42 minutes to do this.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They were very thorough because
they did a zigzag pattern

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:90%
back and forth over it.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.065 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, they didn't like
scramble a bunch of jets to go.

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:02.218 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: No.

00:03:02.218 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They just let
them do their thing?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.932 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: It was fascinating.

00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't even think most
of the people recognized

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.637 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How many
witnesses were there?

00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: There were 15
of us waiting for the bus.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And like I say,
we all, of course,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:84%
had that direct attention, paid
attention to what's going on.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:90%
And then security showed up.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%
They had a strange reaction.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was more they were
stunned and just didn't move.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, at the
end, they took reports,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:90%
as they should have.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But they also told us,
don't talk about this.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.692 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were you affected
by that in any way?

00:03:37.692 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Not at all.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.868 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was fascinated.

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes, oh, you
should have been alarmed.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
this is fascinating.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.217 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Victoria,
at some point,

00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:84%
you did have some
direct contacts.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Yes, so I've had
contacts since I was five years

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have a lot of meaning
to me when I was a child.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But in 2009, I had
a very real contact.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I was in Washington,
DC for work.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I was walking back from
the Norfolk shipyard.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And these two beings just
appeared in front of me.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
They explained to
me telepathically

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that they were Pleiadians
and that they were there

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to show me something
very important.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And then one of them put
his hand on my shoulder,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and next thing I
knew, I was standing

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:90%
in front of this building.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea where it was at.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Brick building, about
four stories high,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:90%
green glass on the front of it.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:90%
We went inside.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
sterile environment.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
He explained to
me at that point--

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.508 align:middle line:84%
like I said, there
was two of them.

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
One of them, I never had
telepathic contact with.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.430 align:middle line:10%
But the main one, he told
me his name was Mwakmwah.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Say that
five times real fast.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:10%
But he took me in.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:10%
We walked through
this lobby area.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:10%
We got into an elevator.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how far
we went up because you

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:90%
couldn't tell from any markers.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think you went
somewhere, or just consciously,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
you went with him, but you're
still on the street with him

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:90%
probably?

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: No, I think I
actually went somewhere.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Or did
you dematerialize?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you just--

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yes.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they
took me someplace

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
because there was a difference
in the external environment.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when we went
into this building,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.765 align:middle line:90%
we got out on the floor.

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
There were clear glass
panels everywhere,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
but it was like an
interactive type screen.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:84%
One of them had
different pictures

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world on it.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
One of them had what
I would call something

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:90%
like chemical formulas on it.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:84%
There were different languages
written on some of them.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, you could
see active movement.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And we walked down this long
hall and went into this room.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
in the room was what

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:90%
looked like a lounge chair.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I sat on
the chair, there

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
was this halo thing that
went around my head.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I felt-- I wasn't afraid
or I felt very comfortable.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this the
one you talked about,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:90%
where it envelops you?

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.575 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yes.

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And could you
explain that to the--

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Sure.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.633 align:middle line:84%
So the chair, for all
intents and purposes,

00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:90%
looked like any other chair.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I sat in it,
it came around like a cocoon.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:90%
It was very comforting.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I felt very good.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
There's these two armrests
that you put your hands on.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's little pads
on there and your fingers

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:90%
are in the pads.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, there's a piece
that's around your head.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
The whole time, I could see
everything around the room.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.852 align:middle line:84%
He explained to me what
was going to happen.

00:06:28.852 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going to
take you on a trip.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:90%
This is our future.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I knew,
we were in the cosmos.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:90%
And I looked out--

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, talk about
awe-inspiring.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.968 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me, he said, this
is the Pegasus constellation.

00:06:46.968 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going to go.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And he had showed me
other constellations

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
so I could have a
frame of reference.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So we went to the
Pegasus constellation.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there was
no time whatsoever.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one minute, I was here,
the next minute, I was there.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
When we came in,
it looked like we

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:84%
were approaching a large
planet, but it turned out

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%
to be a biosphere.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said this is
Omicron Commonwealth.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first time
I had heard that expression.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said this is the
future that has to happen.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, for
me, I have no frame

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:90%
of reference at this point.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going
to take you inside.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:90%
We went inside.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:10%
They could not see us, but
we could see everything

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.185 align:middle line:10%
that was going on in there.

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that really sunk
it for me is the fact that

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
my 12-year-old grandson, he's 12
now, was sitting at a console,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and he was a security
officer for this biosphere.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we went down to the
med bay, and a friend of mine,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
her daughter, who was eight
now, was all grown up,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and she was working
in the med bay.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.528 align:middle line:84%
And so there was that
context for me that wow,

00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:90%
this is really happening.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And your lineage is
continuing to travel 10,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:90%
20 years into the future.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.413 align:middle line:90%
But where's Earth?

00:07:57.413 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: This
is their concern,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and this is what they
were expressing to me,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
is that Earth is lying in
the pathway of something

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:90%
that's coming.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And we needed to come
together as a planet

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and quit being so
divisive, so that we

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
can work together to make
sure that our planet is safe.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, my first
question is going to be,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
so what are you
going to do to help?

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, they have
more technology than we have.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And they explained to me,
we're non-interventionists.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:90%
We can show you your future.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
We can give you
a path to follow,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
but you have to do
this for yourselves.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they took me from
the Pegasus constellation

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:84%
over to the Draconian
constellation, Draco.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we got there,
it was very dark.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of what I
would call roiling-type clouds,

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:90%
and fire, and things like that.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And they said this is the
great evil that's coming.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I don't have a frame
of reference for that either.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they said the Draconians
had allied with the Serpents

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and that they want to take
over the third dimension.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, what do I
have to do with this?

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But they said that
Omicron Commonwealth

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:90%
was a necessity to stop this.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why did
they choose you?

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Good question.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But they said they looked
for the beings that

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:90%
had the gold frequency.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: And apparently, we
don't have that many on this

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:84%
They said there were only
23 in the United States.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:84%
There were 42 all
total across Europe.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So not very many.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And that we all have to
be used for this purpose.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So when they came to me, that's
exactly what they say each time,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
is we follow the
gold light to you.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:90%
So that was my first instance.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:90%
We came back.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I got to
process all of this.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I started on
that path of trying

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how to do this.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And so Mwakmwah
gives me downloads.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:84%
If I get off path, he makes
sure that I get back on path.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So that was really
my first instance.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple
of years ago, we

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
had another instance where
an entire conclave came

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:84%
from the United Galactic
Federation, who has been

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:90%
doing projects here on Earth.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.628 align:middle line:84%
And they walked into our
shop on a Friday night.

00:10:24.628 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What's the difference
between the United Federation

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of Planets compared to the
United Galactic Federation?

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So the original
name was The Planets,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.360 align:middle line:90%
but they evolved.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So they've had a lot of
changes within their system.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:90%
And so they've evolved.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And so they all wore the
United Galactic Federation

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:90%
on their uniforms.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But then some of them also
have the Andromedan Council

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:90%
on their uniforms.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
a conclave, which

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:84%
is where they are
part of the science.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's really the
planetary aspect now,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.683 align:middle line:90%
is that science end of it.

00:10:58.683 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you explain the
concept of the conclave with

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:90%
these extraterrestrial beings?

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Sure.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So, the word conclave,
which they use frequently,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
means a select elite
group of scientists

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
who specialize in
several different areas,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.968 align:middle line:84%
and they bring
them all together.

00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that they mentioned

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
is that every time
a team goes out,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
it consists of the
same type of scientist.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So there'll be one
that's neurocognitive

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and one that's biological,
different aspects of that.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So whatever they encounter,
there's a specialist on site.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:90%
And they're highly intelligent.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So the conclave
itself was assigned

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:90%
to be here for three years.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:84%
They did leave a
little bit early

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.925 align:middle line:84%
when they thought they had
completed their project.

00:11:41.925 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And they also
thought that the rate

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
we were going with our politics,
that this might not be the best

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:90%
place for them to be.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:90%
So they left a little bit early.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:90%
We've since heard from them.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to
negotiate with us to do

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.458 align:middle line:90%
another project with them.

00:11:56.458 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What were
some of their findings?

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: They have multiple
projects going on here.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They've told us that they're
doing archeological projects.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
ancient power sources

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:90%
that have been left behind.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
They do a lot of
volcanic studies

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
here for multiple reasons, one
of them being power, but then

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
also that Geo cache that
happens under the Earth.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:90%
They're interested in that.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at just lots
of different types of things.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:10%
They're really into
neurocognition,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:10%
which is one of the scientists
that they sent to us,

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:10%
he called himself Cat
Stevens, which is interesting.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.528 align:middle line:10%
But he's their
neurocognitive scientist.

00:12:40.528 --> 00:12:42.320 align:middle line:10%
And he said that that's
what they're doing,

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:10%
is could what's happening
here be their future?

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they do a lot of
studies in behaviors.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at the
planet from an outside view,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:90%
we have a lot of trash heaps.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of people
living on streets.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any frame
of reference for that.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they
looked at that and said,

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:90%
what's happening here?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And so they chose.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the third
time they've been here

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:90%
about homelessness too.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:90%
That was interesting.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And they came to see if
changes had occurred in it,

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.782 align:middle line:90%
and it had gotten much worse.

00:13:15.782 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right, right.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I mean, I think the
audience also needs to know when

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.170 align:middle line:84%
we say homelessness, we're not
just talking about the United

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about--

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Worldwide.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Worldwide.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So many different third world
countries are out there with--

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Right, right.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, they're looking
at it from the outside.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And we very much
have that appearance

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:90%
that this is happening all over.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they had more than one
conclave here studying that.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I know that there
was one in India,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and I know that there was
one over in Europe somewhere,

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not quite sure where.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
They believe that a lot of what
the government has put in place

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
creates inequality and
separation amongst people.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
They also believe that the
drugs and the mental disorders

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
are constantly being
brought up in their faces,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that they're not doing
anything to relieve that.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's sad.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And we did-- Althan
had an experience.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:84%
There he realized that they
had not been eating well.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So in his infinite
wisdom, he thought, well,

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll supply them with food.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
He could just go to the ship and
manufacture whatever they need.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And his intention was good, but
it didn't go the way he thought.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And they took it the
wrong way, the community

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that he was living in, and
they wound up beating him up.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And he came back
to me, and he says,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
what happened.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
you didn't fit in.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:90%
You did something.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.163 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you did it out of the
goodness of your heart,

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:84%
but that's not the
way they took it.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And they became very
suspicious of him after that.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And he got a black eye.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.247 align:middle line:84%
Well, he could have just gone to
the med bay and had that fixed.

00:14:52.247 --> 00:14:53.705 align:middle line:84%
But I told him, I
said, no, you get

00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
to wear that black eye
for a couple of weeks,

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't
ruin your cover.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a
learning curve for them.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:90%
And he says, this hurts.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, welcome
to our world.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting
set-up the way they do that.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.632 align:middle line:90%
We do somewhat the same thing.

00:15:11.632 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't call it
a conclave, but we

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
try to put our experts
together to work and network.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
what they're trying

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
to tell us is that look
at things differently.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're so divisive
here, unfortunately,

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that it is hard for us to come
together and look at things.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And usually, somebody
who's looking at it

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
is in such a higher up rank,
some government official

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.530 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, that the
practical application of what's

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
happening at that level
is sort of left out

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
of the scheme of things.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot of
what they pointed to.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.700 align:middle line:84%
They would come and
say directly, well,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
your government's
responsible for this.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:90%
You're creating inequalities.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a divide
between economics.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:90%
And they're true statements.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But you and I, how are
we going to affect that?

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they're looking at,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:90%
is this may be their future.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it is.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
going to happen is

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:90%
that they've recognized that.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And it does have to
do with our resources

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of what they're
looking at is they're saying,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:90%
we need to unify.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
We need to protect the
resources on the Earth.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
We need to learn to
communicate better.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three things that
they've pointed to each time.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
get there, but we

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
have to have an understanding
of what that means as well.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.817 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So who are some of
these members of the conclave

00:16:31.817 --> 00:16:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that you actually interacted
with, and what were their roles?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So the conclave
that we dealt with had two

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadians.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:90%
One was the commander.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:10%
He went by the name of Zendor.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:10%
But they all chose Earth name,
so he went by the name of River.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:10%
And then his liaison officer,
her name was Ilialia.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:10%
She was Pleiadian.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:10%
She chose the name Joy.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting
is the names

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.320 align:middle line:10%
they chose reflected
their real name.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So her name in
Pleiadian means elation.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was an interesting
thing to see how they went

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:90%
about fitting themselves in.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.859 align:middle line:90%
Then there were two Orions.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:10%
They argued constantly about
who was older and smarter.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:10%
And I thought that was--

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: It's kind of comical.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:10%
>> WHITNEY: It is.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.252 align:middle line:10%
And one of them had
a sense of humor.

00:17:15.252 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:10%
The other one did not.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:10%
So one was Althan.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:10%
The other one was Revayh.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And there were two Arcturians,
but I never met one of them.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
He was the data expert,
and he stayed on the ship.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So I never had any
contact with him.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:10%
But the other one chose
the name Cat Stevens,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:10%
and his name was Koh Ni Dah.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.250 align:middle line:10%
And they all had very
individual personalities,

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:10%
but what's interesting
is they all

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:10%
have somewhat of a
similar belief system.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And so they all had
these five premises

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
that they lived
by, understanding

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that energy is everything.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they
believe in something

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:84%
akin to what we
call the Law of One,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that you must have unconditional
love and service to others

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and that you should be
following the 42 universal laws.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they
mention religion?

00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: No.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.862 align:middle line:90%
They call religion the law.

00:18:02.862 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, we don't look
at things the same way.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask them generally
about, do you have a religion?

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say there's
only one source.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.888 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
how they function.

00:18:13.888 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you're
physically with these beings.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.157 align:middle line:84%
What is it like to
be before non-humans?

00:18:18.157 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: We all have
the same energies flowing.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.782 align:middle line:84%
So I felt very
comfortable with them.

00:18:21.782 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I never felt threatened.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So they wear these little
inner phasors on their belts,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
so that they can look
more human fitting

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:90%
in with the homeless people.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, when
they felt very comfortable,

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
then they began to turn
the inner phasors off.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I got to see them
in their real forms.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do they come
here and function in the 3D?

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, they
have technology to do that.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They wear these little
inner phasors on their belt,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and it allows them to
function more as a human.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:84%
They do have to go back
and go through some type

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
of transformation for their
body because of the difference

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%
in gravity here.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now is that
a type of psionic,

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.010 align:middle line:84%
or is it more of an
illusion with the device?

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: No.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:90%
They physically change.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's part
of the reason they

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
have to go have
this repair done,

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
is from going from
one aspect to another,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard on
their actual body

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and along with the
gravity and everything,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
it causes some sort
of cellular breakdown.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they go and
have that repaired.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Usually about every three
months, we would see one of them

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
leave to go have
whatever system they're

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
using to, for the lack of a
better word, rehab their body.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.578 align:middle line:90%
They are much older than we are.

00:19:42.578 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: How much older?

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Several
hundred years.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:90%
One of them was 1,500 years old.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So they have a lot of wisdom
that they've maintained

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.703 align:middle line:90%
in their consciousness.

00:19:53.703 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that's interesting

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
is they can't
represent themselves

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
to most people because
of the frequency.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So they have to step
their frequency down.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.912 align:middle line:90%
We have to step ours up.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're
looking for people

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:90%
that they call are the gold--

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: With a higher vibe.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So that you can come together
and be able to interact.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And so for our
team, I have a lot

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
of people that have high
consciousness but not quite

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:84%
high enough to make
that gap in there.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that was an
interesting thing,

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:90%
is that I can relay things.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
As long as they're
wearing the interphaser

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and that human side is on, they
can interact pretty normal.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
But once they're in
their normal state,

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:84%
it becomes much more
difficult thing.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do your
interactions with the conclave

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
enhance your view
of the universe?

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: I believe we're
all starseeds in some form

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%
or another.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
they are our lineage.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I was raised.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So from that perspective,
I was willing to accept

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.150 align:middle line:90%
whatever they have to give us.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I look at it as a gift.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think it also changed
my perspective in the way

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that I understand that that
unconditional love really

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:84%
does exist out there
because I saw it in them.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that while
they're non-interventionist,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that
they don't care about us.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that changed my
perspective a lot and the fact

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, there is hope
for the rest of us.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what we see on this
planet right now is sad.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to see is
that people could say, oh, look,

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:90%
we too can become that way.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.877 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a change for
me to be able to say, wait--

00:21:32.877 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: There's a possibility.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: There's hope.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.353 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:21:36.353 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that we can get to that
higher level of frequency

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and understand that we can love
one another, that we don't have

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
to constantly be at each other.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You spoke about
the Andromedans earlier.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
How do they fit
into this conclave?

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: They have a big
seat in the United Galactic

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Federation, but they also
have the Andromedan Council,

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:84%
which is their
governing authority.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They believe that they have
always been very progressive

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:90%
towards other civilizations.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
They consider themselves the
shipbuilders of the universe.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:10%
And one was a pilot,
one was a navigator,

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.120 align:middle line:10%
were very standoffish at first.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:10%
They have this very
air of superiority.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But that began to change, and
we started having more fuller

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
conversations.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:84%
What they said to me was is
that there's 26,000 different

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
lineages for them that
has happened over time.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So they don't all look alike.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
interesting about them

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:90%
is that they're very tribal.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So the two of them say they
were bred for their position

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and had markings that we would
consider here very tribal.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way that
they see each other.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was just an
interesting thing because we

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
get markings for whatever reason
here, tattoos and what have you.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very symbolic way
for them to be able to say,

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.828 align:middle line:90%
we're akin to what we're doing.

00:23:04.828 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Would you say
they are the highest part

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.215 align:middle line:84%
in the parliament there,
that you're mentioning here--

00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:90%
you said they were almost.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:90%
So who's higher than them?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I think the Orions
have been there longer.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Originally, there were
people from Sirius

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
that were much higher, but
they factioned themselves off.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
multiple groups now.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that made
a change for them

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:84%
in the way in which
they view things.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But the Andromedans are
still very much part of that.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:90%
They do have scientists.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.665 align:middle line:84%
We just didn't
have any that were

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:90%
scientists in this conclave.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, there was just
the pilot and the navigator.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:10%
Xeronne and Kitanne.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Xeronne and Kitanne.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:10%
>> WHITNEY: Yes.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:10%
Very tall.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Both of them were 9 feet tall.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:10%
Muscular bodies.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:10%
Very athletic.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I always
thought being in shape--

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a bodybuilder, so
I knew about being in shape.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
being in shape.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:90%
They are perfect specimens.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Their faces are a little
bit on the thin side,

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
so they apparently have
a very structured jaw.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The hair, I found-- everybody
growing up, they would say,

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:90%
oh, some of them have red hair.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Some of them have blonde.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:10%
These two, one had
blue and gold hair,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:10%
and the other one had
orange and blue hair.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:10%
Very edgy-looking haircuts.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Like I say, they had symbols.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that they
were tattooed in them,

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:84%
but they have these symbols
that don't wash off.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.542 align:middle line:90%
The eyes are very intense.

00:24:40.542 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when they
look at you, it's

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
like they're looking
right through you.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Both of them had very thin
lips but high cheekbones.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.435 align:middle line:84%
Their ears are a little
bit different than ours.

00:24:52.435 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:90%
We have the rounded effect.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
They have more of a
pointed effect on them.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of extra
cartilage in here.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a lot of that.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
They have a module
that they wear

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
behind their ear that allows
them to interface with their AI.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They have facial
hair or just a hair on the--

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: They had no
facial hair whatsoever.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the arms,
were they long or short,

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and how many fingers
did they have?

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So five
fingers, five toes.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:90%
He made a point of showing me.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So they have a little bit of
a bluish tint to their skin.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:90%
They do have copper-based blood.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think that contributes
to what that is.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
They do talk about the
sun's effect on them.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So they have a different
sun system, they say,

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that contributes to the
coloring of their skin.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:84%
They felt they were
faded here, which

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:90%
I thought was an interesting--

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Faded.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Faded.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So not so much intensity
to their skin color.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I did notice that they had
different colored eyes.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So Kitanne had very blue
eyes, and Xeronne had

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:90%
very turquoise-colored eyes.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You stare at something,
and you try--

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:90%
do they have a pupil in there?

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Because I never saw that really.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But their eyes have very
separate sectioning to them.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So you see a contrast of
color that looks very deep.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think it makes their
eyes look more piercing

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.525 align:middle line:90%
because of that.

00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, it
looks like they're

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:90%
looking right through you.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
noticed that's interesting

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:84%
is we breathe without
thinking about it.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that they
have sort of a breath count

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:90%
that they do.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.287 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was interesting

00:26:46.287 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
because I would have
never thought of that.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think it has to do with
the way in which they maintain

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:90%
their spirituality.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And so we talk about a 10-breath
meditation or something.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I noticed that they
were doing that when they're

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:90%
standing there talking to you.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that's
something all of them do

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:90%
or but--

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.836 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Gives
them energy maybe.

00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Maybe.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
They do have an
aura about them when

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:90%
they're in their natural form.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So theirs was sort of a
blue violent aura, which

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
was a little bit different from
the Orions or the Pleiadians.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
They do say that the area
that they come from, OK,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know whether that
means regional area or it

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.210 align:middle line:90%
means career area.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But they do say that
for the most part,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:84%
everybody that's in
their area is very much

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:90%
reflected like they are.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they talk
about the council,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that they had told us that
when we see the council,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:84%
they wear long robes that
designate who they are,

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.153 align:middle line:84%
that most of them have
long flowing hair.

00:27:49.153 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:10%
And I thought that
was interesting

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:10%
because Mwakmwah, when I met
him, wore a very long white robe

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:10%
and had very long white hair.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know if that's
characteristic of a certain

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:10%
lineage or how they view that.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The Andromedan clothing,
they wear three buttons on.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's a
cuff or exactly what it is,

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's nanotechnology.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And so at one point,
I would see them

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.610 align:middle line:90%
in their customary flight suit.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's like wearing
a second skin for them.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
You can see some shadowing
and iridescence across it

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's an environmentally
controlled suit.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
went to the ship,

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
they were going to change
into something else.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So he just touched
a button, and you

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:84%
could see the whole thing going
up and changing like that.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen them
wear a jacket before

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:84%
as part of a uniform and tighter
pants like we wear in the boots.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.125 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are the boots
and the pants connected,

00:28:53.125 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
or are they separate.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: No,
they were separate.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Arcturians,
theirs is all one piece.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Any headdresses,
or helmets, or hats?

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: The Andromedans wore
a piece that came across this

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Their hair usually
came out on one side.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it had
a visor piece that

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:90%
clung to their forehead.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
probably had sensors

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.610 align:middle line:84%
in it because
occasionally, I would see

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:90%
little lights flash off of it.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.060 align:middle line:84%
But both of them were
that type of headdress.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about
that Andromedan Council?

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.635 align:middle line:84%
What's their part in this whole
thing and their legal authority

00:29:33.635 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
over the governance
of the conclave?

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, they
have a lot of planets.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So they have this
governing authority

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
that they call the
Andromedan Council.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
They make, for lack of a better
word, laws that they adhere to.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:90%
They're very spiritual.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So that was the one thing
that I could see up front,

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:84%
is that everything came
from that spiritual aspect.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And they say that their
council is much more spiritual.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have any frame
of reference for that.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But I can only imagine,
watching these two,

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:90%
and they're very spiritual.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And then to say our
council is more spiritual

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is an interesting
take on their part.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:84%
What I looked at
mostly was the way

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
in which they adhered to
interacting with others.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did they
communicate with you,

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and how did they
communicate with each other?

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, it
depends on who's around.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So if there are
other people around,

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
then they gave me
audible communication.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But if it was just me, then
everything was telepathic.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Which I, honestly,
after doing that,

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.380 align:middle line:84%
is the more preferred
way of doing things.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.255 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:30:43.255 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: You get much more
information more clearly.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they communicate with
themselves telepathically.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
to watch them

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:84%
work because you can tell
something's going on,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:90%
but not a word is being said.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, I think
it's more efficient.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.180 align:middle line:90%
We should get there.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.360 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
is that most of them

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:90%
speak multiple languages.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they just
automatically go

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
into whatever they need to say,
depending on who they're with.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they have a
perspective on spirituality?

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: They do.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.358 align:middle line:84%
So they believe
in the one source.

00:31:16.358 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: The one source.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.525 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: The one source.

00:31:18.525 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They believe that it's
intelligent energy that

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:90%
can self-realize.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Because of that energy
self-realizing, they exist.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they live under the
premise of unconditional love,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:84%
also the premise of
service to others.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
They believe that there
was a period when they--

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.340 align:middle line:84%
or they had a period when they
were doing service to self.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said they saw a
decline in their civilization,

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.883 align:middle line:90%
so they nixed that.

00:31:47.883 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And serve
others, right.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: And serve others.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That makes sense.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Right.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the 42
universal laws is really

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.260 align:middle line:84%
what governs everything
that they do.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So they'll have free
will or cause and effect.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
sides to that.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's what forms the
basis of who they are.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the way in which
they act with you,

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.020 align:middle line:84%
there's such a calm,
peaceful feeling.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:84%
There isn't that anxiety that
you get with a lot of people.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciated
them sharing that with us.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It's very much an
energetic thing.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
energy is everything.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And we'll say something,
and they'll go, well,

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:90%
you know it's just energy.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm saying
that everywhere I go.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:90%
You know it's just energy.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But it very much is the
thing that places them

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.540 align:middle line:84%
above everything
else because they

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.982 align:middle line:90%
will go from that perspective.

00:32:48.982 --> 00:32:50.190 align:middle line:90%
That, well, it's just energy.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do with it?

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how are they
looking at their intelligence

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:84%
compared-- like they're
so smart, you said.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:90%
They have all this knowledge.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
How does that compare to
some of the other races?

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So they consider
themselves revelationists.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: OK.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So having said that, what it
means is seekers of knowledge.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of, here,
money is so important to us.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%
For them, knowledge
is important.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing that
they're always searching for.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And they try to
convey knowledge to us

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:90%
when they communicate with us.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.010 align:middle line:84%
We sit there, and we say,
well, was that a lesson

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I was supposed to learn?

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And they say, no, we're gifting
you the knowledge of it.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
a wonderful thing

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
if we could just gift
each other with knowledge.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
where they're coming from,

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.850 align:middle line:84%
is that they have
decided what's important.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And through their
spirituality, they've

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.120 align:middle line:84%
discovered that knowledge is
really the most important thing

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.360 align:middle line:90%
that we can have.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
seeking that knowledge

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to apply it to
their civilization.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So is this Federation
working with other governances,

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and governments,
and corporations,

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and the military and also people
like you that are gifted with

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:90%
the gold?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Sure.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've had discussions
with them about this curiosity.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And what they've said is
that in the beginning,

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
they did approach governments,
and they were turned away

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:21.850 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of forms, that it seems
to be that our governments want

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.370 align:middle line:84%
something from them
rather than a cooperation.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:84%
So they don't do
that so much anymore.

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:84%
They tend to stay
away from the military

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.814 align:middle line:84%
because it comes down to
the military wanting to know

00:34:35.814 --> 00:34:37.670 align:middle line:90%
what type of weapons do you use?

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.199 align:middle line:84%
How can we get our
hands on those?

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.366 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's not
where they're coming from.

00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they tend to
pick on people like us.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:90%
They can communicate with us.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.650 align:middle line:84%
We're not being
pretentious, or we're not

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:84%
trying to withhold
something from them.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And that allows them to
be more open with us.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So they look for
people that they

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
say have the gold light that
they can go and interface with.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what was your
takeaway from this whole first

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.080 align:middle line:90%
contact for you?

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: My takeaway,
wow, that's large.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's a lot.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Right.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, I always believed
in unconditional love,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
but I got to see
another side of it.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can try to explain
to people what that means.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a different
take on what that means.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw it from
their perspective,

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I really looked at the fact
that I'm on the right track.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And I got up, and I said no.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:84%
They showed me
Omicron Commonwealth.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.110 align:middle line:90%
That was for a reason.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe in what
it's supposed to do.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that as a people.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we look
at this and we

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:54.470 align:middle line:84%
say there's only one race on
Earth, that's a human race,

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:90%
what more to unify to?

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now looking
at this, I understand

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:84%
that they to see us that
way and that moving forward

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:84%
with my last breath, this
is what I'm going to do.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It looks like they
threw out your life,

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:84%
they've been giving you all
these different little messages,

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.470 align:middle line:84%
showing you specific things,
and you put it together.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yes.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And now
you're presenting it.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yes.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well,
thank you so much.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you
being on the show, Victoria.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, thank
you for having me.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:90%
