00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.265 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, we've
seen a lot of coverage.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
The UFOs, the UAPs, and media.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Are they preparing us for
some ET contact, do you think?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:10%
>> TIM: Yes, definitely.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:10%
So we know that the
knowledge about the existence

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:10%
of other forms of
life in the universe

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:10%
is well known for many decades.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
seeing now actually

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is a preparation in order
to bring this truth forward.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
So we see as you said, a lot
of coverage in the media.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that different
incidents have been

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:90%
covered in media and reported.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:10%
For example, it all started
with the Nimitz event

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:10%
where for the first time, UAPs
were actually seen on video

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:10%
and brought to the
public knowledge.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
We also see that the
Pentagon released partially

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:90%
some of the UFO files.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
What we also see is
that more and more

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
often, UAP incidents are unknown
objects flying in the skies

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:90%
are being reported.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And we do see that in
a synchronized way,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:84%
even though not all
media coverage is

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
the same in every country,
we have the same incidents

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese media
and Russian media

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and in US and Western media, but
still different target groups

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.625 align:middle line:90%
are targeted differently.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do you account for
the change of attitude in media

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
without the ridicule factor
that we've seen before?

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: The government, the
media has portrayed UAPs

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and the topic of UFOs and
life outside of planet Earth

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
as something to make fun
about for so many years.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how do we
get from point A to point B?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And point A is
the acknowledgment

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and the existence of other life
forms outside of this planet.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So what we see is
that different groups

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:90%
are targeted differently.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
That means that the
typical viewer of Gaia,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
for example, is prepared
differently compared

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%
to the mainstream target group.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen is that
more and more the assumption

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs, UAPs are a real
thing is being brought

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:90%
to the mainstream media.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
There is actual footage being
put out by those Nimitz events.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But we also see
different headlines

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
in the media like people are
talking about unknown objects

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
in the airspace of the United
States of America and Canada,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:90%
China, and Russia as well.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:10%
We know that a
lot of the priming

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:10%
is being done through putting
out certain cohesive terms.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And that we have the
UAP term as a new term.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Is also one indicator
that we're now

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
being prepared in a
different way, which

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
means that we can actually
fill in the mind space

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and cut off all the
expectations that

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:90%
are linked to the word UFO.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And we also see that the
mainstream news channels

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
are actually talking about
unknown flying objects

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And that actually primes,
in some way, the mainstream

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
population that there are indeed
unknown objects in the sky.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
We even have that in the
official lingo of the Pentagon,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
the White House when the press
actually asked the White House,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:84%
are these unknown
flying objects coming

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:90%
from an extraterrestrial source?

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So we see that all these
little words and terms

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
are being portrayed and
brought into the media in order

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.245 align:middle line:84%
to prime people and to prepare
them for this kind of change.

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do various media
sources target different

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:90%
audiences?

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why is that?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So basically we have
different target groups all

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:90%
over the place.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And this began on
the national level,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
for example, that we
have countries that deal

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:90%
with the subject differently.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
We actually have countries
that are very strictly

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
based on certain religions
and belief systems.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And these have to
target their population

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
in a different way
than, for example,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
the United States of America or
Russia or China or even Europe.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But we see that the
coverage is different in all

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.200 align:middle line:90%
those countries.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And actually, through
internet blockages,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
we don't perceive foreign
media in that way.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So a huge percentage of
the Western population

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%
did not actually
receive the news

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that unknown objects have been
shot down over China or Russia,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
but have been focusing on those
objects in the Western world,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.335 align:middle line:90%
especially Canada and the US.

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's not
a coincidence that

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%
they're shooting them down now.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Are these even real craft, Tim?

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I think the audience
of Gaia is well enough prepared

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to know that a UAP that
uses electromagnetic

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and electrogravitic propulsion
systems and defense systems

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.270 align:middle line:84%
will not react physically in the
same way as a solid object that

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:90%
use Newton's law, in that way.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So the probabilities
that a UAP can

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
be shot down by a standard
F-22 aircraft is pretty low.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it actually generates
its own gravitational field

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
around it, it has certain
different defensive mechanisms,

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and the speed and acceleration
is much, much higher

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:84%
than conventional military
forces can provide.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Still, the coverage
of that indicates

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that conventional military and
conventional weapons are still

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
capable of bringing a
UAP down to the ground.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
This, on the one hand,
portrays, of course,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the military as a
strong force that

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is still capable of
defending its own airspace.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But it also indicates that those
UAPs that have been shot down

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
or if ever, were no
UAPs in that way.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Another fact is that the
airspace around Earth in itself

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much locked up.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no UAP, no
technology that does not

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
have the official papers and
official allowance currently

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:90%
in or around Earth airspace.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So the whole incidents that
those objects been shot down

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:90%
are no UAPs in that way.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But our conventional
weather balloons

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
or technology related
to Earth, it still

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:54.432 align:middle line:84%
means that those are not real
UAPs from an unknown source.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do you
think we're seeing?

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.855 align:middle line:84%
And how does the
media play into that?

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So one thing that is
relevant is the actual form

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:90%
that is being portrayed.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So in the Nimitz event, we
see that they were actually

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:90%
talking about Tic Tacs.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And this form is actually
existing in the UAP world.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
The species that is
actually building

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:84%
those and this
technology, in particular,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
is actually selling it to
different other species

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Speaking about a
Tic Tac UFO means

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually talking
about an actual form that

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:90%
really exists.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not a UFO that is
unrelated to anything real,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's something
that's been portrayed

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's preparing people for
an actual UAP in the future.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:84%
It also seems that
the information

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.710 align:middle line:84%
we get from the Pentagon
or the White House

00:08:53.710 --> 00:09:00.700 align:middle line:84%
were explicitly talking about
grayish metal round objects.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
No propulsion system,
seems to be floating.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So these are the words that have
been put out into the public.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And that also prepares
people for the existence

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:90%
of actually this kind of UFO.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So in my opinion,
I would estimate

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that one of the next
incidents could actually

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
bring the assumption, the
official assumption with it,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:84%
that it's a possibility that
this object in the future

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:90%
will not be from Earth.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So what we're also seeing
are deepfake videos

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:84%
where prominent politicians are
actually addressing the nation

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and speaking about these UAPs
and those unknown objects

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:84%
to be from
extraterrestrial origin.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Those videos are
actually very well-made.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And I found that pretty
interesting, actually.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one hand,
the audio and the videos

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:90%
are professionally made.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But there are also hints
and indicators that

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:90%
show that this is a deepfake.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I assume, and even though I
don't have intel about that,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I would think that these
are videos that are actually

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
testing the real reaction of
people receiving those videos.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You use the term
about our space being locked up.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.235 align:middle line:90%
And who has it locked up well?

00:10:31.235 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, the Earth itself
is going through enormous

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:90%
changes right now.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So the planet itself is coming
from a lower frequential

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
energetic area in
space and it's now

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:84%
heading towards a more
energetic location in that way.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And the preparation
for this shift

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that is currently going on have
been taken for almost a decade

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So all groups on
this planet actually

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
know that this is a
very critical time.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So they've made
sure that there's

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
a special protection of
planet Earth in that way

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that no foreign
force should actually

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:84%
intervene with the
process that's going on.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Because this is such
a sensitive time,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
the chances are pretty high that
bases and forces that are not

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
friendly towards the planet
could take this as a chance

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
destabilization to the planet.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And this has been taken care of.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why is there interest
in preparing humanity for extra

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:90%
political parties and partners?

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: We're actually dealing
with a different scenario

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
in the future, which means that
the planet itself needs to open

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
up for a situation where it's
not alone in the universe

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
but we have neighbors and we
have different other life forms

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:90%
all around us.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we see a lot of advantages
and positive points about that.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But we also see some things
that need to be improved.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And one of those advantages
is that there are more chances

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to create trade
outside of planet Earth.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
disadvantages and weaknesses

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that come from the shifting
situation from the past.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the human
military, for example,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and the trading
companies as well,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
we could see that the planet--

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
a not prepared
planet in that way,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:90%
is not working efficiently.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So there are measures
been taken in order

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:84%
to bring this planet to a
fully functional open society.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What kind of trade
would we have with ET species,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and do these species have
to be similar to humans?

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Actually, the human
species itself is mostly

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:84%
concentrated on trading with
beings that are pretty similar,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
because that is the way you
can get the most out of those

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:90%
trades.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Because a species that has the
same attributes in the way they

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
live, their lifestyle,
what they consume,

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
what they breathe
in that way, these

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
are all criteria
for a good trade.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the number 1 trading
goals is actually technology.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We've seen from the
1940s on that technology

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
was and is something that
humans are very interested in.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that the internet
itself, LEDs, night goggles.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
All this technology
that suddenly occurred

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:84%
in the 1950s, those
are pretty much

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:90%
coming from outside sources.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
This is another reason why trade
and preparation is so important

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the human species
itself has certain weaknesses

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:90%
compared to other species.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
If you think about mainstream
science, then the human species

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:84%
itself is about a few
thousand years on this planet.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
This is not a very large span
compared to the overall age

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:90%
And there are species--

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
way time works,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
you always have species that
are far more advanced and--

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
locations that are
far more advanced.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And these beings, these
proportions of the universe,

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
they have had much more
time in order to prepare.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And they might have capabilities
that the human body does not

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:90%
have yet.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we are, for
example, talking

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:84%
about psionic waves, which
is the ability in order

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
reality of the universe,

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
in order to spiritually
connect to that

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and in order to modify
your own reality,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even utilize that
as a force in some way,

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
this is something the human
species still struggles on.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Compared to other species
and to other possibilities

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, this would
actually make a weakness.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's easy to
understand how humans can

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
benefit from ET
trade and contact.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But what do ETs
gain from humankind?

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: They would benefit a lot
from the technology that Earth

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
humans prepared, because this
species is actually a lot about

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:90%
technology, a lot about AI.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
species that don't

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:90%
have this tendency towards it.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
something else, which

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a factor that brings
destabilization to the planet

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
but could also be
the number one gain

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
point in the future, which is
the warrior nature of humans.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So there are
actually species out

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
there that have not developed
around an aggressive lifestyle.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:84%
They actually do not have
the problems and issues that

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
come along with that attitude,
but they are also not

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:84%
capable of protecting
themselves.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So selling technology,
trading resources

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
is something that's been going
on for quite some time now

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
outside of the eyes
of the mainstream.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the protective
and military complex

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that actually has an interest
in dealing with those species.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If humans are less
advanced when it comes to space

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.195 align:middle line:84%
travel, then aside from warring
mentality, what do we offer?

00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, my opinion is that
around the time after World War

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:84%
II, history split
up in some way.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen is
that the acknowledgment

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial realities,
well, they basically

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:90%
come from the time of the 1950s.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
We've seen those so-called
Foo Fighters in World War II,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
we've talked a lot about
the Roswell accidents

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and all the media coverage
and certain other events.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
And millions of people
have actually seen UFOs.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
But behind the scenes,
the military actually

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:84%
tried to split up from
the mainstream in a very

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%
profound way.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So they found their own sources
of founding of resources

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and they re-engineered a lot of
the technology that they found.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
President Eisenhower actually,
he talked about that.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
He acknowledged the fact
that the military actually

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
was splitting up
from the mainstream

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
governmental
situation and system.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going
on for quite some time.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking
me, I can definitely

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
say that the Earth military has
been in space and is in space.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We heard Haim Eshed
talk about it.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:84%
He's actually saying
that there's even

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:90%
a base on planet Mars.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And he's been responsible for
the Israeli space program.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even
really acknowledged

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream press.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's been going
on behind the scenes.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And even further
behind the scenes,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
we have that going
on for decades now.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are human military
forces capable of being

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.405 align:middle line:84%
protectors of Earth in the face
of extraterrestrial encounters?

00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: What we've seen over the
decades is that we mainly have

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:84%
some kind of breakaway
military situation,

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:49.230 align:middle line:84%
where Earth's military has
actually been separated

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
into a conventional force,
which is also portrayed

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
in the mainstream media but also
a more advanced force that has

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
actually been capable and
actually doing off-planet

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
missions right now and
in the last few years.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We do see an effort in order to
bring those two branches or two

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
separated militaries together by
actually founding and bringing

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:90%
in those space forces.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
We've talked a lot about
the US Space Force.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people might
forget that there's actually

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
space forces all over
the place, newly founded.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:90%
We see them in Great Britain.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Germany has a new
branch of military,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
even though it's not being
portrayed in the mainstream

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:90%
media and not covered at all.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And different other countries
have those new branches

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So we see the
actual effort being

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
made to bring those
breakaway militaries

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and the conventional
military together.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
What is really important to this
is the willingness to protect.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Because over the
last few decades,

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the more advanced
military branches

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.935 align:middle line:84%
were not actually involved in
the situation that is going on

00:20:14.935 --> 00:20:16.390 align:middle line:90%
on the planet itself.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
We see a development
from military branches

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
that actually became capable of
going off planet in the 1950s,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
1960s and been doing space
missions more and more

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
but not caring for the actual
social and political situation

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
They got away even more from
the administrative side.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So they are not actually
that much overlooked

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
from conventional
politics in that way.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:84%
This resulted in this kind
of breakaway situation.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
The most important development
that I personally see

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
is that those advanced
branches of the military

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:84%
are actually right now openly
communicating and showing

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.425 align:middle line:84%
through those
actions that they are

00:21:05.425 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:90%
willing to protect the Earth.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If we've been going
to off planet since the 1950s,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
that suggests the Covert
Space Force is a good 70 years

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:84%
in advance of our
conventional space program.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
How do we compare to other
space faring planets?

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And how do we prepare
for uninvited guests

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:90%
who might be coming to Earth?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: What do we
have to see is, yes,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
the conventional or the
breakaway military is being

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:84%
involved in technological
advancement for 70 years now,

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.520 align:middle line:84%
but the development of
technology is actually

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:90%
exponentially.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot compare the
development of the conventional

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
military to the path that the
advanced military has been

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:90%
going through because.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:84%
While they went
deeper and deeper

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
into other realities
and other species,

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
collecting technology was
one of their main priorities.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the normal
mainstream learning

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:84%
curve in the same way that
the conventional military is

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
annually upgrading
their technology,

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:84%
but you have an exponential
development in that way.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So speaking about an
advancement of 70 years

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
would be a bit
misleading, because it's

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:90%
far more advanced in that way.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're speaking
about other species,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
then you have to integrate the
factor that those species might

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
have had hundreds of thousands
of years of development,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe even millions
or billions of years.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the way
the universe works.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
this time phenomenon

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
where always species and
locations are far more advanced

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:90%
and ahead of other locations.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:58.945 align:middle line:84%
So is the human military
actually prepared

00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to defend Earth
from outside forces?

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:90%
I would say relatively yes.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But there are some weaknesses
to the human military.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And if I elaborate
on them, you will see

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and you will
understand and connect

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:84%
the dots that's
going on, actually.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So one of those factors are
the psionic capabilities.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Psionic capabilities
are actually

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual factor of warring
in that particular case,

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Which means that you could
use your connectivity

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:84%
to the universe and to
reality itself in order

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to modify reality
and to use this

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
as a force against
other species.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:84%
The human society actually
used to be very focused

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
on Newtonian physics, a logical
way of understanding nature

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:90%
and reality itself.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Other species have
come to the point that

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
reality itself is
not linear but can

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
be modified in any possible
way and any thinkable way.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a self-limiting
factor to the human mind

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that they could not interfere
and modify reality in that way.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So everyone saying
this is not possible

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
is actually limiting
their own reality

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and their own connectivity
to that reality.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But other species are
actually utilizing this force.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So one of the major
concerns actually

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
is that an outside psionically
well-developed species

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
could use their psychic
possibilities and skills

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and capabilities in order to
modify or harm the reality

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:90%
that humans are living in.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is number 1, and number
2 is quite understandably

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:90%
the technological approach.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So while the advanced
military's actually

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:84%
been collecting technology,
all over the universe for quite

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
some time, there
are also species

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that are far more
advanced in that matter

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and have linked that
technology to AI systems

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
or even to their own
psychological and spiritual

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So technology, while the human
species is quite far ahead

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:84%
compared to similar
species, there

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
are still other locations in
the universe where technology

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:90%
is millions of years ahead.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: With the existence
of UFOs and the possibility

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
life being out there,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Gaia gets a certain level
of advanced information.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream, however,
the news outlets

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
are so superficial with
the level of information

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:90%
that's provided.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe is the
strategy for that and why?

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So the strategy is
actually to gradually bring

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:05.280 align:middle line:84%
forward the existence and
reality of non-terrestrial

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:84%
species in order to benefit from
all the open systems situation

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that is going on in order to
bring people into this new

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
reality and in order to have
more personnel, more fundings,

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:90%
more technology.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So the situation among people
on Earth is not homogeneous.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:84%
We see that different countries
have different backgrounds.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:84%
The US, for example, through
the Roswell incident,

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
they have this
media coverage that

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
is pretty unique in the
Western world compared

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:90%
to other countries.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Topics and interviews
like this are possible,

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
which would not be possible
in Europe, for example,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
in Germany, or in other
countries, especially

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
those countries who have a
more religious background

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and a stronger integration
of religious thoughts

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and reality systems in that way.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So the actual way
to address people

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
is that each country
is responsible of going

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.560 align:middle line:90%
this path on their own.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So they know what their
population needs to know,

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and they know how to
address those people.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But we also see that
incidents are being copied

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
in some way along the way.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So things that are happening
around Russia or China

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.940 align:middle line:84%
are happening in the
Western world as well.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But the media coverage
is not portraying

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:90%
what's happening there.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So yes, actually
people on Gaia are

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
receiving a lot more of the
truth and the reality that's

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
going on at the behind the
scenes looks and intel.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is still
behind the curtain

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of the membership of Gaia.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Just assuming that those
people who are watching this

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
are well prepared
for this reality

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and don't need the media
coverage and the maneuvering

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.680 align:middle line:84%
around it compared to
the mainstream people.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why is there a sudden
shift to push this information

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.570 align:middle line:84%
into the mainstream
population, Tim?

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.392 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
unusual happening

00:28:17.392 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:90%
in the nearby universe?

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, this has to do
with the spiritual and physical

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:90%
nature of the planet itself.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So each planet goes
through certain cycles

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of enhancing consciousness
and realities in that way.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So reality is not
linear or not stagnant.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's also in a spiral
way, upgrading itself.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And the planet is
actually right now going

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
through enormous shifting
and enormous restructuring

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:90%
of energies.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is also portrayed in
the media for quite some time

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So Chinese scientists,
for example,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
talked about the Earth
core coming to a stop

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.260 align:middle line:90%
and even reversing its motion.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So what we see through
this kind of media

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:84%
portray is that there is
actually a physical shift.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And we do know about it
for at least a decade.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
currently happening.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And the media are
actually playing a role

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:90%
in preparing people for this.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Putting out
advertisements that people

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:84%
should be prepping for
certain situations.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
came to my attention,

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
intel about that but I

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:90%
found it quite interesting.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
That there's quite a number
of new media outlets, new news

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:84%
pages on the internet
that, for example pick up

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:84%
all these earthquakes
and the Earth core

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:90%
coming to a reversed motion.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And they deal with it in
a different way compared

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:90%
to the mainstream media.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
While the mainstream media
is always speaking about it

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:84%
in a still kind of denying
way, those news outlets

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:84%
are actually
acknowledging that there

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
is some relation, some
correlation to it,

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.395 align:middle line:90%
but it's still not--

00:30:19.395 --> 00:30:21.060 align:middle line:90%
it's not easily quotable.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Those new news outlets, they
don't have the same respect

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that mainstream media, for
example, has in society.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As we conclude
this episode about the media

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:84%
preparing humanity
for ET contact?

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.595 align:middle line:84%
What is the end game as
we look to the future?

00:30:40.595 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So from what I know,
there are some scenarios

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:90%
planned ahead that could occur.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that with the
current media coverage of UFOs

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:84%
or unknown objects in the
airspace in Canada, USA,

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and China, Russia, we
see that they actually

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:84%
prepare in some way
for an incident that

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:84%
could occur that deepens
the acknowledgment

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:90%
of non-terrestrial life.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I would say that one
of the next incidents

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:84%
could actually raise the
question much more profoundly,

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:84%
much deeper in that way,
if those objects are really

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:84%
from Earth or maybe even
from extraterrestrial origin.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And that will eventually
lead to the debate

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and the acknowledgment
that we're not alone

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And while we know that
there are tens of thousands

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
other species, potentially,
the media coverage

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:84%
will only be about one or maybe
even two or three of them.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, I want to
thank you so much for sharing

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:90%
your personal story with us.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.157 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:31:59.157 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Until next season.
