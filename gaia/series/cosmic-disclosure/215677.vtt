>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
the Echo 3 incident.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.123 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you tell
us a little bit more

00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
about the Echo 3 incident
and what happened?

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Let's go back to what
an ICBM launch facility is, OK?

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
From the '60s on
until present day,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
the United States Air Force has
established Minuteman launch

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:84%
silos around the western
part of the United States.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:10%
There's 150 missiles at various
places around Wyoming, Nebraska,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:10%
and Colorado.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
They're centered out
of FE Warren Air Force

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Base near Cheyenne, Wyoming.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
This incident involves a ICBM
launch site called Echo 3

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:90%
in Nebraska.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
On November 14,
1976, an incident

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
happened at that
facility, Echo 3.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, every 10 missiles
has a launch control facility

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:90%
that controls those 10 missiles.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And at the launch
control facility,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
there is launch control
officers that control those.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:90%
They're 60 feet underground.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
On the top part of the
launch control facility

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
are the Air Force
security police forces

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and the other administrative
people that control and monitor

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:90%
the launch control facility.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:10%
For every missile site, there's
security police personnel

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:10%
that can respond, and they're
called a SAT team, or Security

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:10%
Alert Teams.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:10%
There's also a backup
team called a QRT,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:10%
or Quick Response Team.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So if there's something
happens at one of these sites,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
these Air Force security
policemen respond.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, these missile
sites are far away

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:90%
from launch control facilities.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
They can be between 15 minutes
up to an hour response time.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And to prevent anybody
or any entities

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:84%
from getting inside these
sites by breaking into them,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
there's two different hatches--

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:90%
an A hatch and a B hatch.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
The A hatch, Air Force
security policeman can open.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
The B hatch, only missile
personnel can open it.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But each site, it
takes a certain amount

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of time, the response
time, to open that hatch.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So if an alarm goes
off at those sites,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
it can take the
security policemen

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
maybe 30 minutes or 45
minutes to get there.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:90%
This particular site, Echo 3--

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
from the launch
control facility,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
the Echo 3 site was a
30-minute response time.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So anybody trying to open that,
it takes 30 minutes to open that

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:90%
hatch normally.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
On this particular occasion,
an outer zone alarm activated.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
An outer zone alarm is on the
perimeter fence of these sites.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a chain link fence,
and there's zone alarms.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
There's outer zone 1, 2, 3, and
4, the four sides of the site.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So the launch
control facilities,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the missile control
officer down underground

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
sees that a light
goes off at Echo 3,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
meaning that something
penetrated the outer zone

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
of that missile site.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.522 align:middle line:84%
Now, within a few minutes, the
inner zone alarm activated.

00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A few minutes.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, that's
bad because now you

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:90%
have access to the missile.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And that should never
happen because it

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
should have taken
at least an hour

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
for anyone authorized, the
missile control or anybody else,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:90%
to open up that second hatch.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So now they know
there's a problem,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and they dispatched the
security alert team.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell me the procedural
aspects of what happened next.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The security alert
team, meaning two highly trained

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Air Force security policemen
armed with a handgun, .38

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
revolver, and an
M16 rifle, respond

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.840 align:middle line:90%
from the control facility.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It takes them 24 minutes
to get to the site, Echo 3.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, the
launch control facility

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
received a call
from Kimball County,

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
missile site is located,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that there's a plane
crash south of I-80.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And this missile site was
about 3 miles south of I-80,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
going through Nebraska,
western part of Nebraska.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And that the dispatch, the
Kimball County Sheriff's

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
was dispatching a state
trooper and a sheriff's deputy.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So now we think that the launch
control facility realizes

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
that maybe a plane had crashed
into it, because that's

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
what the sheriff's department
dispatcher told launch control

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:90%
We had a plane crash.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So as the security policeman
are going out there,

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:84%
they were told there's
probably a plane that

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:90%
crashed into Echo 3.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So when the Air Force security
police arrive, like I said,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
24 minutes later, they see
this huge saucer-shaped object

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%
inside the missile site.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And that presented a lot
of problems for them.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Also arriving at scene was
a Nebraska State trooper

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and a Kimball County
Sheriff's deputy.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that these
people arrived.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Plus, a short time later,
a couple fire trucks

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
come from Kimball
County because they're

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.922 align:middle line:84%
responding to an aircraft
crash, they thought.

00:06:13.922 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But when they get there,
they don't find an aircraft.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, they find the
aircraft, but it's a UFO.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, how would you
explain a UFO crashing directly

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:90%
into that missile silo?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, that's a
good question, Emery.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:90%
How, you know--

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And what's the chances?

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: How advanced
these crafts are--

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:90%
this is 1976.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And we know some about
UFOs because we have them.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:90%
We've had crash sites before.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But how do they crash
into a missile site?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.547 align:middle line:84%
And this is a large, about
a 50-foot in diameter craft.

00:06:49.547 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is it mangled up?

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it cracked open?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're certain
that it crashed, obviously,

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:90%
for what reason.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:90%
How do you know this?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's
damage to the front--

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:90%
well, part of the saucer.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's certainly damage
to the hatches leading down

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:90%
into the missile.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And part of it
was sitting on top

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
of the blast door, which
were the missiles contained

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:90%
on top of the missile.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And so now the security
policemen have a dilemma.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:90%
What do they do next?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, they immediately
call for assistance

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and get somebody out here,
get a supervisor out here,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:90%
get a QRT out here.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:10%
We don't know what's going on.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But during this
time period, they

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:90%
look at the front of the gate.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're away
from the gate somehow.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
They see these
extraterrestrials,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
these 4 and 1/2 foot tall,
gray-colored entities,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
signaled to them, waving their
arms at the security policemen.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the security
policemen think,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
why are they waving their arms?

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Is there a danger?

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Are they trying to get out?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their
craft just crashed,

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
so maybe they're telling
us it's going to explode.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So one of the senior security
policemen at the scene told

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
the fire department, and the
civilian law enforcement backed

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:90%
away 2,000 feet.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
That's standard for a Broken
Arrow in the United States Air

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.557 align:middle line:90%
So they moved back 2,000 feet.

00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's far.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The security police
radioed what they had,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and that he needed
help out there.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So the QRT, which consists of a
14-men Air Force Security police

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:90%
with heavy weapons--

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
they have machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of things--

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:84%
they respond, but it took
them a long time to get there.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
When they get there, by
the time they got there,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:84%
these two extraterrestrials
had climbed over the fence

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and came up to the
security policeman vehicle.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And they start trying
to communicate.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But the security
policeman couldn't

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
understand their
mechanical-sounding voice,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:90%
beepings, and tones.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But the security
policemen kind of

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
figured out that these
two entities, aliens, were

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:90%
trying to tell them something.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So they noticed that one of them
had a mark from the hand, which

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
only had four fingers, up
the left arm all the way

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the shoulder.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And so he realized
this one was hurt,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't know what to do.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:10%
Do we give him first aid
like we would normally

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:10%
give him first aid?

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:90%
So this one was injured.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, are there
others inside there?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Is this alien trying to
tell the security policemen,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
my friends are still inside,
my comrades are inside,

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:90%
we need help?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:90%
There was no communications.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:90%
So what did they do next?

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
The launch control facility
contacted FE Warren command post

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and said, we got an
extraterrestrial craft that

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:90%
crashed into an LCF at Echo 3.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do we do now?

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:10%
They immediately dispatched an
SDART, a Special Downed Aircraft

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.635 align:middle line:10%
Recovery Team, from
Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:09:57.635 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's going
to take a while--

00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.927 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Here we come.

00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --for them to respond
from Kirtland to Nebraska,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:90%
but they did.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:90%
They responded.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Took them 16 hours to respond.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:90%
In the meantime, OSI shows up.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
About 4 and 1/2 hours later,
two OSI agents show up.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And the two
extraterrestrials are still

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
at the security
policemen vehicle.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:84%
By that time, the
security policemen

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:90%
have the site surrounded.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And these two extraterrestrials
are still trying to communicate.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
They never stopped
talking or making sounds.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So the security
policemen realize

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:90%
there's something in danger.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:90%
An Air Force major shows up.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
He takes over
command of the site.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
He's the incident
commander, so to speak.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to
communicate with--

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:84%
drawing on papers,
drawing things

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:90%
and showing them drawings.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They still weren't
communicating.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.782 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Eventually,
two OSI agents show up.

00:11:00.782 --> 00:11:01.657 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There we go.

00:11:01.657 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: A male and a female.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And they went up.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And the female then started
a communication process.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.650 align:middle line:84%
She started trying to
put her mind inside

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:90%
of the extraterrestrial's.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
They moved away from the
vehicles and other people,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were alone
in a little gully

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
just off the road from the site.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And although there wasn't
any sound appearing,

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
there was some kind of
communications going on.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And she came back
up and said, there's

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
four other extraterrestrials
in that craft,

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:90%
and they're all injured.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:84%
We need to go in
and get them out.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.012 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And that's what
he was trying to explain.

00:11:42.012 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: He was trying
to say, hey, help.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So when the DART team
got there, they went inside.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
They opened the site up.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.570 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrial
went up and showed them

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
how to open the hatch.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:90%
The hatch opened.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:84%
They went inside the
hatch, the SDART team,

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:90%
because they had hazmat suits.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
They're the only ones that can
do this and got these others.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, they were dead.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:90%
The other four were dead.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.072 align:middle line:90%
Two of them were still alive.

00:12:09.072 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
They climbed over the fence,
but the other four were dead.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:84%
They brought them
out, the bodies out.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And now what are
they going to do

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
with that craft inside that
launch control facility?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A large craft, too.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:84%
You imagine it's going to
take a lot of equipment.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And what are you going to
tell the civilian community?

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Although it's a
pretty isolated area,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
although there's a farmhouse
about a mile and a half away,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:90%
what do you tell that farmer?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:84%
What do you tell the firemen,
the state trooper, the sheriff's

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
deputy, the
ambulance attendants,

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:90%
because they sent an ambulance?

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.345 align:middle line:90%
Well, then--

00:12:52.345 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's
what you guys do.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's what OSI does.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
They came up and said, listen,
this is an Air Force craft.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It's experimental.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It was flying out
of Offutt Air Force

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:90%
base, which is also in Nebraska.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
It was SAC Headquarters
back in those days in 1976,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:90%
and it crashed.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And these were all
people in suits

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.268 align:middle line:84%
because the sheriff's deputy
and the trooper saw these--

00:13:20.268 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I mean, how
are they going to fake that?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So now they have to
perform a major disinformation

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:90%
program to try to convince them.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.492 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know that the
farmer ever came out there,

00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
or there was any
indication in the report

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:90%
that a farmer came out there.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But there were
five or six firemen

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.800 align:middle line:90%
and ambulance attendants.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
story that was put out.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether they
believed it or not--

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:84%
but what they did was
they moved everybody away.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
They said, hey, we
don't need you anymore.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Get away.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:90%
All Air Force equipment came up.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they created
a national defense zone,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
which means that
these whole area is

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
under the control of the
National Defense authority.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.032 align:middle line:84%
And Air Force brought in
all their own equipment.

00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You said
they make sounds.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:90%
They look like small Greys.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.105 align:middle line:84%
Are these the EBENs
or something else?

00:14:11.105 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, these
were the EBENs.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: These were the EBENs.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: These were the EBENs.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I think that was the consensus
of the final report that

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
was done by the SDART
and the OSI agents.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Other OSI agents came
to the scene after that.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And the experts arrived.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were almost
convinced that this craft

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
was being flown by the
extraterrestrial biological

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:84%
entities, that the same group
of extraterrestrials that

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
were involved in the Roswell
crash and other crashes--

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Did we shoot them down?

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Why did they crash?

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
It appears that there was
some sort of a disruption

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:90%
in the craft's guidance system.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're dealing
with different technologies.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But remember, by 1976,
we had thoroughly

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:90%
examined the 1947 craft.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
This is some almost
30 years later,

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
so we are pretty sure that we
know something about the EBEN

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:84%
craft, but except that this is
the largest EBEN craft we ever

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
had encountered, this one,
that had landed or crashed.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
The '47 crash wasn't
as big as this one.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So now how do we figure
out what happened?

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the biggest problem is
getting that thing from there

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:90%
to Area 51.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.508 align:middle line:90%
Because in '76, Area 51 was--

00:15:38.508 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did
they transport that?

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, that's
the good question.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: On a truck
at night or what?

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They did it
entirely at night,

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.715 align:middle line:84%
between 1:00 and
6:00 in the morning.

00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:84%
They planted a route that
would go by places where they

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:90%
could hide it in the daytime.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, you imagine the
difficulty of doing that.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But because you got I-80,
that goes to populated areas,

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:07.027 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure along the way, they had
to do a lot of disinformation,

00:16:07.027 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
because they had to get
probably highway patrol or state

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
police involved in the
escort of this thing.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they
were telling them.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a flying saucer.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:10%
If it looks like
a flying saucer,

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:10%
there's probably
a flying saucer.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they could
hide that, but they did.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And they got it down to Area 51
in the latter part of December.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:90%
So it took them from--

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
November 14, 1976, when it
crashed and almost New Year's.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 27
or 28 of December.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They finally get it to Tonopah
testing and training range.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they were
able to fully examine it.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And based on what we learned
from the Roswell crash

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.605 align:middle line:84%
in 1947, because it was the
same craft, same technologies,

00:16:57.605 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
we put together what
we knew and the fact

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that we had two
extraterrestrials that

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
later became guests of
ours at the S2 annex.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, although I
don't know personally,

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
I can't state for sure that
they probably helped us

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
in explaining what
happened to the craft

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and how their avionics or
guidance system failed them.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if they
come from wherever

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
their base of that, all
this great distance and they

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
can't navigate, but
they crash, there

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
has to be some major problems
with their technology or maybe

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
something we caused, because
in 1976, we still had radar.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:84%
We had actually advanced
radar systems in 1976.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
We were experimenting with
over-the-horizon radar and some

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
of these other highly
sophisticated radar systems

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.725 align:middle line:84%
that maybe disrupted
their guidance system.

00:17:57.725 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Real quick, isn't
there a picture of that?

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.975 align:middle line:10%
There's a couple pictures
out there floating around

00:18:01.975 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:10%
with that on the flatbed.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: There are.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is that real?

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, there was one--

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean,
they're old pictures.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah,
there's one picture,

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that was taken in Wyoming
that had an Atomic Energy

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Commission marking on it.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a Department
of Energy then in 1976.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
We had the Atomic
Energy Commission.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So anytime we moved any
kind of nuclear material

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.680 align:middle line:84%
during that time period, it
was under the Atomic Energy

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Act of 1954.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
signs on this movement

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
showing the Atomic Energy
Commission equipment.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one of the
stories they told people.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:90%
This is Atomic Energy.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
This is maybe a nuclear
reactor or something.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know for sure.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But I would guess that
that's what probably what

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:90%
they were telling them.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's
Atomic Energy

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:90%
symbols that were on the craft?

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they
were covering up

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:84%
any other symbols that were
extraterrestrial on the craft?

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I'm pretty
sure there were

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
the same symbols on the
outer skin of that craft

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that we found on the 1947
Corona crash of the EBEN craft.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:90%
But there was a tarp over this.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Atomic Energy signs were
on the outer side of the tarp.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So a passerby would only see
these Atomic Energy Commission

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
warnings of radiation, stay
away, whatever they said.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So with the two
survivors, they have this craft.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
They have their four
colleagues that are dead.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
What kind of arrangement did
they make to stay here at S-4

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
or to do what?

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The female OSI
agent was negotiating this.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.610 align:middle line:10%
She was communicating
telepathically

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.116 align:middle line:10%
with the one extraterrestrial.

00:19:46.116 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And she was explaining
what they would have to do.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much she
told them that what this was,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:90%
the missile site.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:10%
Back then, they had MIRVs,
reentry vehicle platform with

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:10%
three 170-kiloton
yield nuclear warheads.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.615 align:middle line:84%
But I think they
probably knew that.

00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, she
explained to them,

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:84%
your craft has to
be moved someplace,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and we have to take it to a
place that we can examine it.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't fly it.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
There's no other choice for
you but to cooperate with us.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take you
to a safe facility.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:84%
We'll do whatever we
can medically for you.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take your comrades to
a facility, which I'm not sure

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:90%
where they went.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And the OSI agents
that I talked to,

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the four dead extraterrestrials
were taken by another team

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to another location.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And they believed it was
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But that is a question
that I always had,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:90%
but I could never get answered.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:84%
The two live
extraterrestrials, they

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
were flown to S-2 annex, which
was really the only facilities

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
that we could keep them out
during that time period.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And the female OSI agent
negotiated this with them.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to make them
understand that there wasn't

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.105 align:middle line:90%
any other option as well.

00:21:15.105 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
What are we going to
do with the craft?

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:90%
We can't leave it there.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:90%
We got a missile down there.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And so they had to move it.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they seem
pretty cordial about it

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:90%
that we were trying to help?

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And was there any
animosity there?

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think the
fact that the EBENs had

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:84%
been in communications with
humans for so long a period

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:90%
of time, that they trusted us.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's only my opinion.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.732 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They know we're not
going to do crazy to them.

00:21:43.732 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think it's just the
fact that we're not hostile

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:84%
towards them, benevolent towards
them, and they are towards us.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:10%
And I think they realize that
there wasn't any other choice.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:90%
What else were they going to do?

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And what they were able to do is
get a medical kit or some kind

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
of medical supplies out of
the craft, the crashed one,

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and they were able
to heal themselves.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
bring out the equipment

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:90%
and patch themselves up.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And because we have a unique
relationship with the EBENs--

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
another ship came.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was able to
take those two away

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:90%
and maybe even the bodies.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty sure the
two live extraterrestrial,

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:90%
the EBENs were taken back.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
about the bodies.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, I was never briefed,
and there wasn't any indication

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
in any reports that I've read or
the OSI agents that I talked to

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:84%
about what happened to
those four dead ones.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
They went someplace,
probably Wright-Patterson.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And where they went from
there, I don't know.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.193 align:middle line:84%
And I don't whatever
happened to the craft

00:22:51.193 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's still
out there or not.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But I know that it took
about six months to repair.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
The Echo 3 launch
control facility

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.250 align:middle line:84%
was offline for about
six months before they

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:84%
were able to fix the doors
and all the other damage that

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:90%
was done by that.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how was this OSI
agent able to communicate

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:90%
with the EBENs?

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, Emery, we
talked about Katie Smith.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:84%
We did a whole episode
on Katie Smith.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
That female OSI agent was Katie
Smith, who we know was a hybrid.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
She had the unique
ability to communicate

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:90%
with these extraterrestrials.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:90%
No one else was able to do that.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But she had focused
herself and her psyche,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, on this one
particular extraterrestrial.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to
mind meld, so to speak,

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:84%
her mind with that
particular extraterrestrial

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:90%
in order to communicate.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for
Katie Smith, I don't

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.438 align:middle line:84%
know how we would have
been able to communicate.

00:23:54.438 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, we spoke
of extraterrestrials

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
using telepathy to
communicate, especially

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
when they approach a human that
doesn't even know telepathy.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And they are able
to, psionically,

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
with telepathy, talk and
communicate with these people.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they use
their capabilities

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:84%
to speak to the
security officers

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:90%
or anyone that was there?

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the two security
policemen were extremely busy.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:90%
They had communications.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
They were coordinating
with other law enforcement.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they had time
enough to sit there or stand

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
there and direct some kind of
mind system back and forth,

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:90%
thought process.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were probably as
in a very excited state

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:90%
as the extraterrestrials were.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was
something being attempted

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrials,
but it just

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.113 align:middle line:84%
wasn't getting to the
security policemen.

00:24:52.113 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
anything else that you

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
learned about this
event over the years?

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we had
the unique ability

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
the extraterrestrials

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
by a hybrid who was an
OSI agent, Katie Smith.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Game changer.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Big game changer.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know
at the time, as I've

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:90%
told Katie Smith's story.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know at the time
that she was a hybrid.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:90%
She knew.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:90%
But later on, we determined it.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And she, of course, assisted
us with a number of operations.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
we learned was

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that we needed
hybrids to communicate

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, at
that particular instance

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:84%
time in 1976, we had one,
and that was Katie Smith.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Thank you again,
Rick, for being on the show.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Great to be here.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
