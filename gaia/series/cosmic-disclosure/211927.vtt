00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we are with Tim,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, define for us the
concept of multiple timelines

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and how they work.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: So time is actually
a very interesting concept

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:10%
in this version of the universe.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't mean
that time is existing

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:10%
in all versions of the universe
because there are locations

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:10%
in the universe that exceed
time or even do not have time

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:10%
in the way that we perceive it.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
A very understandable
example of that

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
is whenever we go to
sleep, and we dream.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:84%
This, for example, is an aspect
of the universe where you

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:90%
do not have a concept of time.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple worlds
even where intelligent life is

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:90%
living outside of time as well.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But in this version
of the universe,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
we are dealing with
time, which actually

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
means that this
version of the universe

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
has a concept of something,
a logical cohesive way

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:90%
of development in that way.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about time, we're

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
talking about timelines
and time string.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So this basically means
that every observer,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
every consciousness unit
creates its own timeline,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
but it also integrates itself
with all the other timelines

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
into a major time string
in the middle of it.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is Earth's timeline
one of multiple simultaneous

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
timelines, or are they connected
like many branches of a tree?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's perfectly
put because we actually

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:90%
call this a time tree.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So the concept itself
is a time tree.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
This is based upon the
fractal nature of the universe

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
or at least this
version of the universe,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
where the universe kind of
ripples, smaller versions

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:90%
of itself into infinity.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So what we're dealing
with is actually

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
a main time string that is the
profound and stable version.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're also dealing
with individual timelines.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So everyone itself is
on a certain timeline

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and merges into a time
string in the middle

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking
about Earth itself.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to take
into consideration

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with a
parallel universe in itself

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:90%
in its physical nature.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So only because we are actually
observing and perceiving

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
one particular version
of reality at this time,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean that
there aren't parallel,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously happening other
versions of Earth as well.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So mainly, we're talking
about three phenomena which

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.600 align:middle line:84%
is unique timelines,
where every consciousness

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
unit, every observer creates its
own timeline, where he, she, it

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:90%
is on.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
We have different time strings
for different planetary

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
versions of Earth
that we're going

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to talk about and look at in
a deeper sense in a minute.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have this overall
global time string

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
where we have a stabilized
and merged version that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
will define the stable
outcome of what's happening.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do these
parallel timelines

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
may be in parallel
universes merged together,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.835 align:middle line:84%
and can we be aware of
other versions of ourselves?

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: There's a
constant merging

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:90%
of timelines at all times.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's not quite easy
to recognize in that way

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:84%
because from a perspective
of one observer,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
the perception of time is
always linear in that way.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we're always
inside of time,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
we're only perceiving it as
a linear flow in that way.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The universe has this wonderful
feature where it's constantly

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
merging failed timelines
into the most stable

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
of all timelines, which
ultimately is the one

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:90%
creative field in that way.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's also merging
different other timelines

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:90%
into your own timeline.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very complex.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But because everything
is connected in that way,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
everything in the
universe is connected

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
through a one-point
field, there are

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.670 align:middle line:84%
influences from
timelines and locations

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
far, far, far away or
even in parallel universes

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that might shine through into
our own perception and reality.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But again, most of the time,
because we are so focused

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
on our own timeline, we will
not actually perceive or realize

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
what's happening.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
parallel versions of yourself,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
then it's becoming even
more complex and complicated

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
because a consciousness
is able to perceive

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
multiple angles of
reality at one time,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
but that is related to
the amount or the level

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
the individual observer

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:90%
is capable of.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you're an untrained
human in that way,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, you're actually
focused on one reality and one

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
observer status on one
being, and you might not

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
perceive yourself in different
other timelines as well.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
You still could be influenced by
different versions of yourself,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
but all these versions are
in that way not yourself

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
but individual timelines
and individual observers

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:84%
steady that are unrelated
to your own self.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
If you become more
and more conscious

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
about this phenomenon,
then yes, you

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
can actually
communicate through time

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
or through the non-existence
of time with your own self

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
into different other
quantum realities.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is fairly
complex, but yet there

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
are intelligences in the
universe that are actually

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
performing this and/or
working on different timelines

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.703 align:middle line:90%
in the same time location.

00:06:58.703 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
a finite number

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.233 align:middle line:84%
of timelines in relation to
what's going on right now?

00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's a
wonderful question

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
because that is one of the
most elaborated and highest

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
questions that the
universe itself

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
has about the infinity of finite
status of quantum timelines,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:90%
and it's still being debated.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So we, and when I say we,
I mean the whole universe

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
is not entirely
sure at the moment

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:90%
if it's finite or infinite.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that
it's close, approximately

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:90%
close to infinite timelines.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is humanity going on
with the flow, so to speak,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
with the increased number of
timelines being played out,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
or are we an active
players, perhaps

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:90%
swimming against that flow?

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We are carried in
some way by the stream

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of the collective timeline, but
we're also constantly creating

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:90%
unique timelines as well.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you again see the
model of the time tree,

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
which is, by fact, the
actual term for this concept.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
the time tree, you

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
might have individual
timelines like branches

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:90%
that go out of this trunk.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
But those branches
might at one point

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:84%
stop developing, just
as a normal tree that

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
stops its own growth
at a certain time.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And these might become
failed timelines,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
or they might even go into
a more complex and higher

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
dimensional physical
model of time,

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
which cannot be described
in this 3D vectorized form.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.810 align:middle line:84%
You are constantly
being influenced

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
by the collective timeline while
also constantly, collectively,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and individually influencing
the collective and your unique

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:90%
timeline.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Both.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The soul is Tim
in Germany at this time.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same soul
playing out a different life

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
in a different lifetime or
even a different timeline?

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interesting.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is,
and this is only

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
true for this particular
version of reality

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
that we are perceiving
because there

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
are different other sets
of reality in this almost

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
infinite reality
pool of the universe,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
is that our own perception
of our location and time

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:90%
actually defines where you are.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So the way you perceive yourself
and the way you think you are,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is real until
you overcome this model.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And once you
overcome this model,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
we are not talking a 3D
model, but we're talking

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:90%
a multi-dimensional model.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And that means that you
can go into every location

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and every time at once.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Because time itself can
and is indeed a dimension

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:90%
that can be traveled through.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
This is true since Einstein
came up with his physical model,

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's more and more real
the more we think about this.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So for the human
reality, the theory

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
has that your pineal
gland is actually

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
the point in your
brain that calculates

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
where you are defined
in location and time

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
such a thing as

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
successful versus
failed timelines,

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and how is that differentiated?

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, the
wonderful thing, and I

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
think this is so
important to emphasize,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
there is always the
successful timeline.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The time string in the
middle is always successful.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So whatever the universe
does, and again, this

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
is the universe perceiving
itself in a dualistic way.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask a German
advanced scientist,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
he would say it's a model
of simulation in that way.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to speak
about a simulation,

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
then the simulation always
succeeds in this way.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But individual
timeline also allow

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
for what we would define
as failed timelines.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So an individual being could
be on a failed timeline

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
due to very exotic
or unusual decisions

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
or maybe not performing
those actions that are

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:90%
in his own fate in this way.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So a timeline could
become a failed timeline.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But the wonderful thing
is, and again, this

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
is the phenomenon of
merging of timelines.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Once someone suffers from
being a failed timeline,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
he gets integrated into the
global, universal, successful

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.850 align:middle line:90%
pool of timelines again.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we combine the
concept of timelines

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:84%
with the levels of
realities that I explained

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
in previous episodes, then we
have a level 6 consciousness

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
or level 6 reality, which is
the realm of non-existence

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So every timeline that goes
through a failed timeline,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
a wrong decided path in
that way will ultimately

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
jump into this field of
level 6 consciousness, which

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:90%
is non-existence.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But non-existence is
still part of existence.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is the safety
net of the universe,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
how to reintegrate
failed timelines

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
into the successful
pool of timelines again.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What goes into a
so-called failed timeline?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, basically,
a failed timeline

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
can consist of a lot
of different factors.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So we have to keep in mind
that everyone, every observer

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in that field, at
least we theorize

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
that has a sort of
pre-negotiated fate

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
So everyone who is incarnating
on a planet actually

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is coming from this level 6
reality field, which is, again,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:90%
the field of non-existence.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But within this field
of non-existence,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
the universe still exists, and
it's still actively planning

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
on your reality, and
you're more or less

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
what the concept of Karma
and Dharma is in the Vedas.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So basically, every
soul has a, if you

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
want to put it that way,
spirituality, a soul plan.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:84%
A fate, a pre-designed
fate in that way.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But you still, when you're
inside of your timeline,

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
you're still free to choose
your different path in that way.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you totally
get off that path,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
you might result in
a failed timeline.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
A failed timeline
could also very easily

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:84%
result in a quasi, randomly
appearing incidents.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're designed
to, for example,

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
develop a certain cure for a
certain sickness or something,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
but this particular
person, I don't know,

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:90%
hits a bus or something.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Then ultimately, this timeline
comes to a physical defect.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So a physical defect could also
result in a failed timeline.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that the
soul fate of that observer

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness unit is
determined or finished

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in that way because through the
concept of incarnation, which

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:84%
we see all over the
place in the universe,

00:14:54.230 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
this being would just revisit
and re-live his own destiny

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And also we see a phenomenon,
which is kind of interesting,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that when your own
timeline is super stable,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that your parallel
versions of yourself

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:84%
might have already
failed in some way,

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
but your self-perception is
always on a successful timeline

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:90%
or time string.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So a parallel universe or a
model of a parallel universe

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
would mean that by definition,
one version of yourself

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.060 align:middle line:84%
has already hit a bus
or died in some way.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But as long as your observer
is still connected to your body

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're still on
this path, then you

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:90%
balance that out actually.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is constantly
jumping your consciousness

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:90%
into the most stable timeline.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And it does that job very well.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's balancing out
a lot of the imbalances

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and problematic
events that can occur.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It does that on an
individual level,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
but it does it also
on a collective level,

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
so that we're still
on this planet,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
even though the chances
of life on this planet

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
are so minor and so
vanishingly small

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
that is resulting from this
merging effect, this stability

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:90%
effect of the universe.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, are humans
the dominant influencers

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:84%
of our timeline, or are
there outside influences

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.447 align:middle line:90%
affecting it?

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Beautiful question.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So the reality field
that we are perceiving,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
which is a standard
environmental sphere

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
the planet, it's

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:84%
actually deriving from
a circular movement

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
in the model of time reality
and the model of the geometrics

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And this circular
movement actually

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
creates this ball-like
illusion that we have,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
which we might call Earth,
or a planet, or whatever.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So once as long as we're on this
field, inside of this field,

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:84%
inside of this
reality bubble, we

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:17.920 align:middle line:84%
are actually the most
profound source of information

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:84%
that this field is
actually derived from.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
that other sources

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:90%
aren't influencing that field.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So everyone outside of
our own reality field,

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:84%
everyone outside of our
own informational field,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
timeline, they still
have an effect on us.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe itself
is connected in every point,

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
in every direction, in every
dimension, and in every time.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are intelligences in
the universe that are actually

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
utilizing this
phenomena in order

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to either stabilize or
destabilize certain outcomes.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the
role of starseeds

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
on our planet in
terms of timelines?

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the situation
is as follows.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So what we have is a fairly
unprepared society, that even

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
though we have seen
glimpses of a new reality

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
in the 1920s of
the last century,

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
we've seen new model of physics
as quantum physics arise,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
we still have a situation where
the majority of the population

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:84%
of humans are
actually, I don't want

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to say ignorant about the
reality of the universe,

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
but mainly not as interested, or
prepared, or informed about it

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:90%
as they should be or could be.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:84%
This could lead to fairly
disastrous outcomes in that way

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
because other beings,
other intelligences,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
other lifeforms out
there could take

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:90%
advantage of that in some way.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So strategically, it means
that the universe needs

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to protect itself,
and the universe

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
does that through
a concept that is

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
very close to the concept
of incarnation in that way

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
because a higher
intelligence could influence

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
the field by becoming
aware of its own body

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and its own reality
inside of the field.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually the
definition of incarnation.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we perceive
and what we've learned,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:84%
especially from
conversations with Being 6

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
is that it has incarnated
around approximately 300 to 500

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
million of its own
beings and aspects

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
in order to stabilize the
reality field from inside.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So quite a big number
of people are actually

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.590 align:middle line:84%
coming from a source that
is of higher intelligence

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and might have placed him or
her or itself onto this reality

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.122 align:middle line:84%
field in order to
provide stability to it.

00:20:10.122 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, because
most humans are not

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
aware of how Earth's
dynamics work,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
could humankind be taken
advantage of, and by whom?

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Very easily actually.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't say
humanity has not

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:84%
been informed because the
models and the physical models

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics and
quantum time and such

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:90%
are actually out there.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
It's more a question
about, a, being

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
able to deal with the
consequences of it, and b,

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:90%
caring about those questions.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So most people are so involved
with the standard reality

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on in
society, and politics,

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and you name it, that
they don't care, actually.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you're speaking
about other intelligences

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
taking advantage
of what's going on,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
then you need to take
into consideration

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that the universe itself
in this form and reality

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is still kind of captivated
in a kind of game of strategy

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:90%
and tagging in that way.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So the universe plays this
kind of game with itself

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
by certain aspects trying
to elevate themselves

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:90%
over other aspects.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And that typically can
also be done through time.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
In consequence, that means that
the stable timeline of Earth

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
could be brought
into instability

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and have tremendously bad
effects on the whole collective

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:90%
if you want to do so.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's been done this
way, but there are also

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the universe.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Again, the universe is
a very secure form model

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
of reality in this
way that saves itself

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:90%
from this interference.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Many people suggest
that time, as we experience it

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:84%
daily, feels like it's moving
more quickly than it used to.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, it's not
my own perception of it

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:84%
actually, so it's not my
individual perception of time.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But I've also come
across a multitude

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
of people who have this
perception of an accelerating

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we
can scientifically

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
define that in a way that
the further the planet

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
moves towards a more
energetical context, the denser

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
the energy and the
more information

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
are located in one
point of space time.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So yes, time seems to
accelerate in some way.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I actually would
say that, and I'm

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.250 align:middle line:84%
trying to not predict too
much of what's going on,

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:84%
but time is actually one
factor of a level 4 reality

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
world in that way, and we
are heavily and acceleratedly

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:84%
moving towards this
reality of level 4.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So time becomes more
and more relevant to us.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We even see that
in our own history

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:30.680 align:middle line:84%
because nobody would have
asked questions about time

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:90%
until the 1920s or something.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So time itself is a
dimension, and it's

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
a way to perceive and
define the universe.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I would say that especially
technology will rapidly

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and intensively
deal with the impact

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
that time can have
on technology.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.100 align:middle line:84%
For example,
communicating through time

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is actually a thing
because, again, time

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:90%
is a dimensional field.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's an informational field.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So communicating through time
will become a mainstream thing

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:90%
at some time.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only like
taking your smartphone

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and calling someone else
who's in the same timeline.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But at first, we will perceive
messages from another timeline.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And you bet that this
already happened.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you, for example,
look at certain crop

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
circles around
Europe, for example,

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:90%
and we did an analysis on them.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
We have certain examples
that very much indicate

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
that there are informational
contexts coming

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:84%
from different timelines
into our timeline.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
The actual message was, which
was kind of interesting,

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:90%
was just this is a message.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It just implies that
what we perceive

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:90%
was a message in itself.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So at first, I think
we will acknowledge

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive information
from outside of time.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And at one point or
another, mainstream society

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
will become able to communicate
and to send information

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.233 align:middle line:90%
into time as well.

00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how
do you distinguish

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:84%
between crop circles
as communication

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:84%
from us outside this
timeline versus the ETs

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:84%
actually creating
contact in this way?

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Oh, that's an
interesting question.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
I guess we can't in that way.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we see is
that some of those crop

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:84%
circles that we've
done analysis on

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:84%
are some way of communication
from other aspects

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, which
not necessarily needs

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to come from an ET
presence or in other--

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:84%
outerworldly,
otherworldly aspect

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.390 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves or something.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It just can be an
undefined message

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:84%
coming from an intelligent but
non-defined aspect of reality

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:90%
of source in that way.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But the particular crop
circle that we did analysis on

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:84%
was actually showing
the model of how

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
time ripples into
different dimensions--

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
into different
directions in that field.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So the message, the crop
circle itself describes

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:84%
the physics of how time
ripples into the past

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and into the future
and on its way,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
through those two
directions, influences

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
different other
timelines on its way.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Because that message
and the model that

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:84%
was given to us through
this crop circle

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:84%
was so significantly
put, we assume

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that it's coming from a
different timeline in that way.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Since we speak
different languages,

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
we have different physics, how
did you determine the message

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:90%
from this crop circle?

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, we've done a lot
of analysis of certain crop

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.970 align:middle line:84%
circles because what
we've seen is that there

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:90%
is a communication going on.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
There are different
sorts of crop circles.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Some are indeed coming
from non-personalized forms

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like a
non-specified intelligence that

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:90%
is sending that information.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And the motivation to do
so was that some of them

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
are actually containing
useful models for technology,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:90%
for physics in that way.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And this was particularly
the case for this crop circle

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking about.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So it actually
showed, and I think

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.190 align:middle line:84%
it showed up somewhere
in Northern Europe.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And it actually shows the way,
like in a vectorized 2D model,

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
the way that time
behaves on a 2D field.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So because we already are
well aware how time works,

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and there is actually
technology around time

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and the informational
field of time,

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's been in use in
some advanced projects,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
we could determine that
this vectorized field

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:84%
or this pictogram
in that way actually

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:90%
resembles the model of time.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So is this coming from
us in a different timeline,

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:84%
back to this timeline, or is it
extraterrestrial intelligence

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with us?

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Analysis says that there
are different classes of crop

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And the particular one
that we are talking about

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
is a non-personalized
form of crop circle.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that maybe there

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is a personalized individual
consciousness or intelligence

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But it means that
we have no indicator

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to say that it's coming from
a personalized, individual,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
collective field or specific
species in that way.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In previous
episodes, Tim,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:84%
you've mentioned a
time traveler species.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Do they affect the
timeline of humankind?

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting thing
is that the universe itself

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:84%
becomes aware of time as
a dimension at one point.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.146 align:middle line:84%
And we're already
talking about this.

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:84%
It's on us to become
aware of that.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So once aspects of
the universe actually

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
know about how time works, they
can utilize it in that way.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way individual
aspects of the universe

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:84%
actually create another form
of safety for the stable life

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.210 align:middle line:90%
version of the universe.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
actually experiencing,

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about that I think
in an episode with Richard Doty

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.880 align:middle line:84%
is that we're experiencing
a very ancient and very old

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:90%
thought of the universe.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
If you want to talk about
the model of physics

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:84%
of the universe being a
simulation in that way,

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
you could say that
we're experiencing

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:84%
a very early access version
of the simulation in that way.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So the universe put
out something in order

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to have a stable environmental
field, a console, so to speak,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
in order to code
from that point.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:84%
So once individual aspects
inside of this field

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.970 align:middle line:84%
become aware that
time is a model

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and an informational field,
they can go through time

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and even influence the model
and the reality field in itself.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we see is
that while we're

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.420 align:middle line:84%
perceiving this very,
very ancient old thought,

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:84%
there are also aspects
of the universe that

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:84%
are traveling through
time and influencing

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
the timeline on this end in
order to make it more stable.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, is what seems
like chaos on Earth right now

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:84%
part of a chaotic
aspect of the universe?

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So mostly,
we're experiencing

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:84%
an environmental field that
is, if you want to say,

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:90%
still buggy in that way.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it's one of the primal
versions of the universe,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's so ancient in
that way, it still lacks

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and it still has certain
non-functional aspects.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And we perceive them through
our own individual human reality

00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:84%
as non-functional aspects of
duality, like death, or sorrow,

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But it also means,
and this is the beauty

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:84%
about time in itself, that
even though we are here

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of buggy
version, there's

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.790 align:middle line:84%
already a version
of the universe that

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:84%
is more advanced,
and further away,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and highly integrated in itself.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And this version can reach down
and is actually reaching down

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:84%
in order to debug the version
and the environmental field

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing here.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it like debugging
or rewriting the program that's

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:90%
not functioning properly?

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: This depends on the
individual factor again.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:90%
So the further we go away from--

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
if we see it as a 2D model,
like a timeline in that way,

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and we are somewhere
here on the string,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and the further we
go this direction,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.310 align:middle line:84%
the more advanced and advanced
this environmental field

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:90%
becomes.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is more or less the
model of those reality levels

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.840 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
The further away we go
into this direction,

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:15.340 align:middle line:84%
into a unified source
field of the creator,

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:84%
then the more it
is reaching down

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:84%
in a benevolent
and unified field.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Because along the way, it
has repaired and created

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.910 align:middle line:84%
a very, very advanced and
elevated form of itself.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But the further down you
go the road, the more you

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:84%
could say that it's still
another buggy version that

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:84%
is trying to patch the
downgraded version below it

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.100 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But the wonderful
thing is, and I

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.590 align:middle line:84%
want to emphasize
this, is that there

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is this beautiful, stable, and
functional creator and source

00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:84%
version of us where all
paradoxes are already solved.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is, if you want
to call it God Field

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it exists,
and it also reaches down,

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:90%
and it helps us out.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If everything comes
from that perfected God

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:16.610 align:middle line:84%
field or the ultimate
resolve timeline,

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.940 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, how does
it allow for the bugs,

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and the imperfections,
or chaos at our level?

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: There are two
reasons for that.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
One reason is that
time in the way

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.409 align:middle line:84%
we define it also
matches experience

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:32.360 align:middle line:90%
because time itself is motion.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:84%
We need to think of
time as logical motion

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.389 align:middle line:84%
to come from point A
to point B. Actually,

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:84%
there is no time in that
way because the universe

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:84%
itself is timeless, ageless,
and everything all at once

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But if we're inside
of time, time

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:57.160 align:middle line:84%
is a proper way in order to
come from a point in location A

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:90%
to point in location B.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So on this way, and
this is the, to me,

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
fascinating effect of time, we
are going forward into time,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
but we're also perceiving
time backwards.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
think about an apple,

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and you keep it in your hand,
and you watch the apple,

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:84%
then the information that comes
from the apple into your eye

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:90%
are actually past information.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:84%
They are not the
current information

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that are you are asking
for, but that information

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:84%
come from the past
version of the apple.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:43.090 align:middle line:84%
If you go further back into,
for example, light years

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:49.450 align:middle line:84%
into the sun that is several
light years away from Earth,

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.600 align:middle line:84%
then the light that
comes from there

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:84%
describes a version of
the sun that is already

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.830 align:middle line:90%
vanished in that way.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
beauty about time.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And if we think
about that, then we

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:84%
have again this
wonderful geometric force

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that we are going inside
of time, we going forward,

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:84%
but we're also perceiving
the past in every moment.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we are
already perceiving in that way,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:90%
it's gone.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:84%
While we're still
simultaneously perceiving it,

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
it's already
non-existing anymore.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
beauty to it for me.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.308 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So if time
is defined as motion,

00:36:30.308 --> 00:36:32.600 align:middle line:84%
as people have the ability
to go within their own self,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
like we do in our
meditation, can I

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.790 align:middle line:84%
influence a positive
outcome for reality

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
based on the
stillness of me being

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and becoming a timeless being?

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Interestingly depends
on the observers around you

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.140 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you are
alone in a space,

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're the only
observer that is there.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And we've already done
scientific experiments on that

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're the only observer,
and you don't observe time

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.890 align:middle line:84%
in that way, you're free of
time because nobody is actually

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:90%
observing time in that way.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes back into a
level 6 field of view reality,

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and it can go in
every way possible.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But if there's another
observer inside

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.270 align:middle line:84%
of the same observed
space, then this observer

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:30.500 align:middle line:90%
also defines time in that way.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And this might be
actually the reason

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.850 align:middle line:84%
why we know a lot of
gurus and prophets

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:84%
went underground or away
from civilization in order

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:84%
to be just for themselves
because that is the moment when

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:84%
there's no other observer
in the room in that way.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But you could also say
that if everyone aligns

00:37:54.380 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to that, and the collective
itself is the observer,

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.140 align:middle line:84%
then you can have similar
effects, probably even

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:90%
more powerful than that.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.977 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:38:10.977 --> 00:38:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:25.000 align:middle line:90%
