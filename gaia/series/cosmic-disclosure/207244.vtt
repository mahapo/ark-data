00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we're with Tim,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor from Germany
who analyzes and suggests

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:10%
various strategies in relation
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Richard Doty,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:10%
a retired
counterintelligence agent

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:10%
who served in Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.245 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here, Emery.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you, and
I love the perspectives.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's so rare that
we have two guests on the show

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
exploring the same
topic together.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It's really going to
be a fascinating day.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have one thing that
you guys all have in common is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial types.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we
would like to do

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is get a US perspective
of that and also

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:90%
a German perspective of that.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So maybe, Rick, you
would like to start off

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:90%
with that, the types.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: During my time with
the Air Force Office of Special

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Investigations, I had access
to information pertaining

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrial life and
contacts that we had with these

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
entities that visited Earth
over a period of time.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
The DIA had named
these entities.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
the first one, Ebens,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
who came to us here from Zeta
Reticuli, the crash site,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and crashed in
Roswell, New Mexico.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we had other races,
such as the Archeloids,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
the Tarantuloids, the
Hepaloids, and the Akerloids.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So one thing I want
to really stress

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is that each one of these
five entities that we

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:84%
knew about back then came
from different planets.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
They came here with
different technologies,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and their bodies were
biologically different

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.517 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, I think there's
a misconception out there that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
all these craft and all the
extraterrestrials were all from

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.790 align:middle line:90%
one place.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: No.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:90%
They were from different places.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens, we know they
came from Zeta Reticuli.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
The Archeloids came
from another star group.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:84%
The Quantaloids--
they're all different,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%
and they look different.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
If we were able to capture,
say, for instance, and Archeloid

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and an Eben, we
would have to set up

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
different facilities
in order for them

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
to adapt and live on
our planet because they

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:90%
breath different air or gases.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick, can you define
these types that you just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
mentioned to the audience,
so they have a better

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:90%
understanding of it?

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: One of the things
that was so confusing to us was

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
that-- we didn't
know it at the time,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:84%
but later on, we determined that
they were able to manufacture

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
humanoids which are
somewhat androids.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:90%
They were somewhat computerized.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
how they did it.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have the
necessary background

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
on explaining that part of it.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But they can take on
different appearances.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the Ebens,
they were the Greys.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
They didn't take on
other appearances.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:90%
They were Greys.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
They appeared as Greys.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And now, they were
able to manufacture

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
other robotic types of
entities that assisted them

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:90%
in space exploration.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But if they came to
you here in this room,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
they would appear
to be the Greys.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now the Quantaloids,
there were different.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:84%
They could take on
humanoid appearances.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
They could be
considered the Nordics

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:90%
or the Scandinavian types.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, they had other entities
that they could create--

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
their robotics, their
assistance, so to speak.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
When we dealt with
them, what I read

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
was that they had what was
referred in the document

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
as assistants, entities that
did work for them that they

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't do or couldn't do.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And these assistants also
spoke other languages,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.348 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Slavic-looking ones
and the Nordic-looking ones,

00:04:20.348 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%
they could speak English.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, they
couldn't speak other languages.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And so each one of these,
the Hepaloids were,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
again, they took on
different appearances.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:90%
They can be the smaller ones.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They can appear
with larger heads.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are the
frightening ones, possibly

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:84%
the ones that might have
appeared in the Mississippi

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
incident, where the
two men on a dock

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
saw these entities appearing and
missing time back in the '70s,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So every one of these brought
on a different appearance.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.745 align:middle line:84%
But they were all from different
places in the universe,

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
biologically different.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, what's your
experience with some of these

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
You heard Rick talk
about his experiences.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can tell
us a bit about yours.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Sure.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing,
I have to say

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:90%
that I am from my background--

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know names
that Rick brought up,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
but I can confirm
the information.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I did have several
years of direct contact

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:90%
with some of them.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So there are those preying
mantis style insectoid beings.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:84%
They have an alliance with
what I would call the greys.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So something that
seems important to say

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
from my perspective is that
there are Ebens and a species

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:90%
that I would refer to as Greys.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
They are both greyish
from the color.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But the Ebens are an
actually biological life

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:90%
form which needs to eat food.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So they consume, they
digest, they breathe.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
While what I would
refer to as Greys

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
are smaller beings, about one
and a half meter, maybe less--

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
the Ebens are a little taller.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And they are fiber
beings, which means

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
they have developed
over the necessity

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:90%
to have biological bodies.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
This is something they got
rid of because they felt

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:90%
there's no actual need anymore.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
That brought some
problems to their species.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
That's also why they are kind
of interested in humanity

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:90%
because humans--

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
from a table of potential
evolutionary options,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:90%
humans rank very high.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot
of diversity going

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.960 align:middle line:84%
on on Earth, which means they
need to solve a lot of things.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:90%
They make a lot of experience.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
That brings the
potential of evolution

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:90%
in a pretty high range.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is interesting
to the Greys--

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:90%
what I would refer to as Greys.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:90%
The color is a little different.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, the Ebens are
biological beings.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are
fiber-printed beings,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
which make them also connected
to a different energetic force

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:90%
or power.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And they do not digest
the way the Ebens do,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
and they do not consume.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I also can confirm the
technology you mentioned,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
which, to my
knowledge, is something

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that came from what I would
refer to as Greys, which

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of
consciousness-assisted avatar

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
thing, where a Grey
consciousness can move into,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and they totally
appear as a human form.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And the same technology is
used by the preying mantis.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So that is why the preying
mantis sometimes looks

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and appears like human forms.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like a programmed life
form or a type of AI hybrid?

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: No.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It's an empty vessel
that looks like a human,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
and it's also a
biologically grown body.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And they can, because it's some
kind of-- the consciousness

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and the awareness
is something that

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
can be extracted from
one vessel to another.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The greys are
pretty good at that.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty much what they
do to all their lineages.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And that is what they do.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
They take these empty vessels,
they put their consciousness

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
into that, and they can even
speak German through that.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And through their
alliance which they have,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
the preying mantis
can do that as well.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: During my time in
government intelligence,

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:90%
we learned some of this.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I heard a lot of
scientists talk about this,

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
although I was not
directly involved

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
with any analytical
portions of trying

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
to explain what the
different races did

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:90%
or the complexity of them.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
was presented in the documents

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and was highly
classified at one time

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is that these entities can take
on different appearances of us.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was what our
scientists refer

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to as more relaxing to
a human to see something

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that they could
understand, especially

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:90%
in abduction situations.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:84%
They would appear
as something that

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:84%
was more relaxing to the
target or the person that

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
might be being abducted or
contacted, the contactee.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:90%
And so they can.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I understood was of
most of these different races

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:90%
could appear differently.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Or we thought that maybe there
was some other entity that they

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:90%
brought into the picture.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it wasn't
them that was making

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:84%
this appearance but some other
entity that was brought in.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I was
talking about human androids

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that the Ebens created that
could do work for them.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that was
clear in these documents that I

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.560 align:middle line:90%
read back in the '80s--

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
probably, the middle '80s
was that these entities

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
were so complex that was very
difficult for us to understand

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
their biological nature, the
physiological nature, and even

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
how they functioned because
they were so advanced.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And their bodies were
made of things that--

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
types of structures that
we had never seen before.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So we couldn't go
to a science book

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and open it up or a biology
book or an anatomy book

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK,
compare this to this

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
because we had nothing to
compare these entities with.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And through
my experience,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
I was exposed to cloning
and, as Tim was saying,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:84%
this consciousness being
infused into the body.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Now Tim, you and I have talked
about this on other shows.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%
You told me at one time that--
is it possible that they

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
could actually take
a normal human person

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and take over that body?

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I think that is a
possibility that can be done

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and also depends on the
level of consciousness,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:84%
the defensive that a subject
can build up in order to protect

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:90%
oneself.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could they take over
a political figure, let's say?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Some beings are
more into technology.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Some beings are
more into something

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:90%
that we would call mind control.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
There are also
beings-- and we talked

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
about that-- who are
Reptilian from their genetics

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that can alter their
appearance, but they are also

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
using a psionic
kind of technique

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
in order to confuse people
in what they perceive.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
That is also why
sometimes, you have

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:84%
cameras that pick up
something different than what

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:90%
people would pick up on.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that the Greys did
use some other efforts.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
They put a lot of effort
into contacting humans.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
They placed hybrids
on this planet.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
There is, I think it's
called, a tall white in pop

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
culture, which are basically
hybrids from the Greys placed

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:90%
especially in North America.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to have human
bodies and greyish faces--

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:90%
can be the other way around.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:84%
They have greyish
bodies and a human face.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of the
early stages in the--

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- maybe around
the '80s, where the Greys tried

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
they did a lot of contact
with the governments.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
They felt that other things
are necessary in order

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with humans.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
They also came to conclusion--
and there is something we had

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:90%
a lot of exchange on--

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that people react very
paranoid and paradox

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
for their view when they
so-called abduct somebody.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a
lot of misconception,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
at least from abductees
on the experience.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But also, the effort that
they made to contact humanity

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:90%
was huge.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Rick, what could you tell
us more about the Greys

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and the political figure
and also the documentation

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:90%
that you've covered?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Well, one of the--

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
the actual incident I'm
going to talk about--

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
it's something that
happened at Fort Dix,

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
an army base in New Jersey
back in the '70s, whereby

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:90%
we actually shot an ET.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
surveillance camera.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:10%
And there's people who
have spoken and given

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.240 align:middle line:10%
presentations on this.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:10%
Wendelle Stevens
was one of them.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:10%
Robert Dean was another one.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Clifford Stone
talked about this--

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:10%
a number of other
different people.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not trying to steal
their bandwagon, so to speak.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.567 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
hasn't really been brought out

00:15:26.567 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
is that there was
surveillance cameras

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:90%
on the perimeter of this base.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:90%
It was inside the base.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
top-secret facility

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that this entity
was getting into.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But on the camera, you see
one particular appearance

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:90%
of this entity.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But when it came over the fence,
it appeared as a human being.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So this particular
entity had the ability

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to go from its original
form into something

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that the MPs, the Military
Police, could relate to.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, it was shot.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But that's an example of how
they can change appearances.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have the
knowledge of exactly which

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
entity this was.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it was a Grey,
but it was a taller Grey.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the four to five-foot.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It was actually almost
five and a half foot

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
or even close to maybe to six
foot or, like, two meters.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.792 align:middle line:84%
So there has been a lot
of different stories.

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
There's actually been
books written about this.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that wasn't mentioned,

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%
other than they had--

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in these presentations,
they talk

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:90%
about a surveillance camera.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't go into
details of what

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
was appearing on it because
that was classified and remained

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:90%
classified.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Wendelle Stevens, who
had been out of the Air Force

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:84%
for a long time,
says, I'm not going

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
surveillance camera

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
because I think that information
might scare the public.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:84%
If some entity coming
from another planet

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
was able to come here and make
an appearance like a human,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
so you would become maybe
friends with or walk up to,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly,
it changed into

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:90%
some hideous-looking entity.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah, so I get--

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:90%
it's totally right.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think it comes down to the
agenda of the specific species,

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I guess, because at
least some of the--

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
not all of them-- but some
of the more Reptilian origin

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
species that
interact with Earth,

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:84%
they have a wider consciousness
on what's happening on Earth

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
mainstream common people--

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:90%
human on Earth.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to take advantage
of the structure and the power

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.605 align:middle line:90%
structure at some time.

00:18:05.605 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
The Greys seem to have a
different agenda on that.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure-- to come
back to your question, Emery--

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
they could produce some
kind of clone or something

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that appears like a political
figure, for example.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they
will do that because they

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:84%
have a different
approach to humanity.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
They are not getting
into taking advantage

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:90%
of the power structures.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They are more into
the genetics that are placed

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:90%
They are one of the--

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
we know that there are
about 12 species that

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
have put their genetics
into humans way back.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:90%
The Greys were one of them.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And also because they had
some spiritual path they were

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
on, and they made some
mistakes, they have some kind

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
of-- their stock's in
humanity, and they try to--

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:90%
that's their actual agenda.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:90%
When we were talking with them--

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
or when I was communicating with
them, one of the main questions

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:90%
was, what's their agenda?

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Are they a threat or not?

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And something that they
came up is that they're

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.570 align:middle line:90%
interested in preserving the--

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
they call it tonal
dynamics, which

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:84%
means they are interested
in development of humanity,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
so humanity can
make experiences.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And they have this
kind of cooperating

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
species that kind of
learns from the experiences

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
of other species.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So that is why they
are interested.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is also
why they pick up--

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
or get in contact
with different people.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
They get in contact
with governments

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
because they have this pyramidal
scheme, authoritarian society

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:90%
that they live in.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But they take
farmer people from--

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- Minnesota.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good reference?

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Or a businessperson from
New York or something.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't care about the
social-cultural position

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
other than, for example,
some other species that

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
have influences on us.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now I've
never seen this,

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
but I've heard through
many investigators that

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:84%
the Reptilians are working
with Greys sometimes.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And isn't there some sort of
opposition there since they

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:90%
both have different agendas?

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So it's hard to
figure out when we're saying

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Reptilians, we have like--

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right, assuming.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: --a huge
number of species.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Like I already told you
in a previous episode,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
there are some
Reptilian species that

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:84%
do look like reptiles, like
this snout or something.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
species that have

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:90%
evolved in a different way.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:90%
They look differently.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that
inside of human genetics,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.750 align:middle line:84%
they have found
reptile DNA strings.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: You know about that.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.862 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Of course, yes.

00:21:26.862 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So as I said there
are about 12 species.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:84%
They all have their own agendas,
and they have manipulated

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:90%
the genetics of human beings.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate
more on these 12 species

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:90%
you just talked about?

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I haven't got details
on all of them.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's
about 12 species--

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:90%
at least, that we know of.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
There might be some other
influences that we don't know.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:90%
But the Greys were one of them.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the Greys,
in some way or another,

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
they see themselves as the
father species of humanity

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:90%
because way back--

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and they are time travelers,
which is pretty interesting.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They have understood
the temporal dynamics;

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
that time can be a dimension
as well in which you

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:90%
can move forward or backwards.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way they got
their stocks into humanity

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and also the way
they argue why they

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:84%
can be so invasive in some
kind of way or another

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
because most species tend to
not go proactively into species

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and influence them
or affect them.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:90%
But the Greys do.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And they say they were
here way down the line.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:56.970 align:middle line:84%
They evolved the human
species from an ape species.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And they also have humans
that transformed into the Grey

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:84%
society because the
Greys, what they are doing

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
is extracting
consciousness from bodies

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and putting them
inside of their very

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
intellectualized
and mental system.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
They have this kind
of internet going on,

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
where they extract souls or
extract awarenesses and put

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:90%
them inside of their system.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of species, a lot
of-- even star systems planets,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
they are all kind
of inside of what

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.938 align:middle line:84%
I refer to as Greys, and
that's their mission.

00:23:35.938 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So basically,
what you're saying,

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
there's many different types
of Greys out of these 12

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about that are
different hybrids, and races,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and mixes of
extraterrestrial DNA.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: They are
constantly evolving

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:84%
because of the experiences and
genetics they take and extract

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:90%
from other races.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:90%
They are building upon that.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:90%
They have this thought--

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
because they go back and
destroy their old lineages,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:84%
they have this thought that they
come to a point in the universe

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
where they have
connected to everything.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And then in the final last
step, they radiate or erase

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
their own final
last step and then

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:90%
ascend to a unified universe.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Great.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So Rick, tell me a little
bit about your insights

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
on what Tim just shared.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, what Tim
just shared was fascinating.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But Tim opened up what I
would call a Pandora's box.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:84%
There's been things
that I've discussed,

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and haven't discussed, and
won't discuss about my knowledge

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:90%
of the ET phenomena.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
the fact that back

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s, one of the
things that the United States

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
government-- this is something
I probably would never

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:90%
have talked about until now.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Tim brings it up, so
I'm going to tell you.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:90%
It's out in the open.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the things that
the United States government

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.330 align:middle line:84%
was very, very concerned about--
and this didn't start in 1980.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It probably started
way before 1980,

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
when we had an Eben in captivity
at Los Alamos from '47 to '52.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
President Reagan was deathly

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:84%
afraid of-- his administration,
during that early part

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:84%
of the '80s was
whether an ET could

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
take over a body, such
as a politician's body,

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and maybe run the government
or whether they could perform

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:84%
a mutiny, whether these entities
could come in and spread out

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:84%
within the government
and take over everything.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we started

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:84%
creating in the '80s
with biometrics,

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
they developed--
there was a number

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:84%
of different laboratories
that was contracted

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to develop biometric
systems to make sure

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that a human being was
who they said they were.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So there was, I think, five
different biometric factors

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:84%
that they were
able to experiment

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
with that they could
identify a human

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:90%
as that particular person.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were primarily
concerned with the government,

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that the politicians within
the government-- the president,

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.578 align:middle line:84%
vice president, members of
his cabinet, and so forth.

00:26:31.578 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
They weren't talking about
the entire human race.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But they're talking
about just their--

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and so they were
able to do this.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:90%
They were able to experiment.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:90%
And there were five people.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:10%
One of them was
Caspar Weinberger.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.920 align:middle line:10%
He was one of the
ones that they first

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:10%
gathered this biometric system.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And he was one that was they
called labeled to make sure

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that-- he's Secretary
of Defense--

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:84%
make sure that he was
who he said he was.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And there were factors,
and there was a system

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that they could identify him
within just a few seconds.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know exactly
what that system is.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Maybe Tim knows.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:84%
But there were
biometric systems--

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:90%
and you know about biometrics--

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that they gathered about
from these different members

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
of Congress in order
to protect them

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
from being cloned into
something extraterrestrial.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You know, absolutely,
I can definitely verify that,

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:84%
working at Los Alamos
Labs in Sandia.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:90%
It's very perfected now.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
They can do it
from very far away.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:90%
It measures DNA frequency.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
When you clone someone, the
DNA does change a little bit.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So if there was any
manipulation of your DNA,

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:90%
they would know right away.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And it would stand out.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And they also use
different types

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
of scanners, types of video--

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.620 align:middle line:84%
types of scanners that
can look at the body.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.837 align:middle line:84%
Just like you said,
the camera picked up

00:27:59.837 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:84%
this entity jumping over the
fence, and all of a sudden,

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:90%
it went human.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:84%
There's some special
cameras they use.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:90%
They cannot hide from that.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
They can see the inner
parts of the being.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, one of the
things I worked on or was part

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of during my time at the
Institute for Advanced Studies

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.570 align:middle line:90%
was human frequencies.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Every human being has
a particular frequency.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
We measured it, and it was
just like a fingerprint.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
We know the exact frequency
of every human body

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
because everyone
has different one.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the key is how to
manipulate that frequency.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Number one, as you said,
measure the frequency,

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:90%
know what frequency that is.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Number two, make sure
that when that person

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.780 align:middle line:84%
comes into the room,
that particular frequency

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:90%
you're measuring--

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:84%
not the human being
walking in, but make sure

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.610 align:middle line:84%
that frequency is connected
to that human being.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And number three is how to
manipulate that frequency.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing experiments--
and this is still classified,

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going into that-- how
to manipulate frequencies.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilian-- they
had a problem back

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
in the early '90s with the
Reptilians, as you said,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
because they were
able to manipulate

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.530 align:middle line:90%
the frequency in front of them.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they could
get by some of our equipment

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and techniques to see that.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.235 align:middle line:90%
But it was all frequency-based.

00:29:26.235 --> 00:29:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: You both are right.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do you
think about that, Tim?

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So to my knowledge--
and you both said it already--

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:90%
there are two ways to test it.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
It's one, the frequency
because, I think, in the '90s,

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:84%
they found out that every entity
irradiates some different kind

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:90%
of frequencies.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:84%
This is something they
can measure by scanners.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
is, there exists

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:84%
a quick test, which is
basically taking genetics

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:90%
in order to see that.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The genetic one is
probably more accurate,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
whereas the frequency
one is more global

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and can take a wide
range of people.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there are satellites
that track anyone at any time.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
If anyone's been to an
airport, a train station, a bus

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:84%
station, or a major city, your
frequency has been recorded.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And it is what it is.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So they can find out where
Emery Smith is at just

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
the push of a button anywhere
on the planet, even underground.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Another thing that--

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
as long as we're opened
up this box here--

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.880 align:middle line:84%
another thing that we found back
then, in the early '80s was--

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into great
details on abduction phenomena.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.375 align:middle line:90%
But the hybrids, the ETs--

00:30:57.375 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know which one.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Maybe Tim knows.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which race
was able to manipulate

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:90%
DNA in the human body.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, back
then in those days,

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
DNA was just on the forefront.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we didn't
know a lot about it.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But they were able
to manipulate the DNA

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to make it look
human or test human.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.165 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality,
they masked it.

00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how they did it,

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.915 align:middle line:84%
and I would be
interested to hear

00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:84%
what Tim would have to say about
how a ET race could manipulate

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:90%
human DNA.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:84%

contact with different planets.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They have done
genetic manipulation

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:90%
on different, other species.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:84%
They manipulated human DNA
at least 15,000 years ago.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And one of the things

we're not here to hurt you.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to harm you.

We're here to study you

And now, we want to
look at your evolution.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Species that
go higher in awareness.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.990 align:middle line:84%
They understand that
we are connected

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to be in
friendship with each other.

approach to the universe.
