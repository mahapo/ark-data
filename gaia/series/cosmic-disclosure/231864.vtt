>> RICHARD DOTY:
The next mission,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.870 align:middle line:84%
they had to get a
portal near Venus,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and they came out 80,000
years into the future.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:90%
They recognized the sun.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.325 align:middle line:84%
They recognized the planet
Mars, but there's no Earth.

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:84%
In its place were several life
spheres, as they call them,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
huge spheres with
a ball inside of it

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
that looked
something like Earth.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
He's saying these life
forms are similar to what

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.057 align:middle line:84%
we would refer to as an octopus,
but a land-living octopus.

humans look like 80,000 years

into the future?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:10%
What if an advanced
extraterrestrial race

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:10%
with a human appearance
made contact and helped

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:10%
shape our space program?

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we're

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Pleiadians said

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to have quietly influenced some
of our most secret off-world

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:90%
developments.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Joining me is Richard Doty,
former Air Force OSI agent.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske, MUFON field
investigator and your guest host

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Richard, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Thank you, Josh.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.245 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I'm super excited to
continue this conversation.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But let's just back up a little
bit to the original incident

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
or I guess the first
documented encounter

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:90%
with the US and the Pleiadians.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 1959,
and it was in Nevada.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me more about that
scenario and that encounter?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, it
was October 1959.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
A craft crashed north of a
mining operation in Nye County.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the
Air Force came out,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
recovered the
downed craft, which

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:84%
was an extraterrestrial
craft belonging

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
to this particular entity,
took them all back to Area

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
51, which was in
operation in 1959.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
place else to take it,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:90%
so they took it out there.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, over
time, they found

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
that this particular
entity was a Pleiadian,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and the craft was from
that solar system.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And they code-named this
particular entity J-Rod.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: J-Rod.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so in UFO folklore
and history, you hear a J-Rod.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, J-Rod was a Pleiadian.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And came from the
planet, crashed,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and we had him as a guest
at Area 51 all these years.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, the Pleiadian star
system had thousands of stars.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Thousands.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they have literally
thousands of planets.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We're only dealing
with where J-Rod lived

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and those surrounding planets
within his solar system.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's confusion
between when somebody

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.577 align:middle line:84%
said a Pleiadian, maybe there's
a Pleiadian from another planet.

00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure, yeah.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so we're
only talking about J-Rod

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
his society and his planet.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So what brought
J-Rod here in the first place?

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: EBE 1 told us the
reason that Eben civilization

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:10%
came to Earth or started
visiting Earth was

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:10%
because of past wars we had
on Earth and the fact that we

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:10%
detonated a huge weapon
that brought them.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
The detonation at
Trinity site in 1945

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
was an advertisement
to the universe

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that this particular
planet in the Milky Way

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Galaxy, in our solar system
had some type of a weapon that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:84%
was maybe something that
they'd never seen before

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
or they had seen it and
they quit using it in war.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And then jump ahead
a month later,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and within a period
of three days,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
two more of these
great huge bombs

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
were detonated over
two different cities

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:90%
in a place on Earth.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So that brought them
here to try to figure out

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
why is this civilization
doing what they're doing?

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, jump ahead
to J-Rod, when we

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
were able to fully
communicate with J-Rod.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
J-Rod, rather, was a
different civilization.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
He came from a different
biological group,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:90%
said the exact same thing.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: You guys are doing
something on this planet with

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.412 align:middle line:90%
these huge explosions.

00:04:36.412 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
That brought us here to
figure out what you're doing,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
brought them here.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So we're out there
in the UFO researcher world.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes J-Rod is
referred to as an Eben,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
but you're 100% sure
he was a Pleiadian.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And it was a Pleiadian craft.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:90%
He was from the Pleiadians.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, you
look at it this way.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
There are people out
there that start talking

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:90%
about EBE 1 or the Ebens.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
the crash site at
Corona, or Roswell.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And that we had EBE 1
in captivity for 1952.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
There are people that have
started stories out there

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:90%
about EBE 1 never died.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:90%
He went to Nevada test site.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
He went to Area 51 and
comparing EBE 1 to J-Rod.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:90%
But J-Rod was not an Eben.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
J-Rod was a Pleiadian that
came from the Star Group.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It had a different technology
and different biology than EBE.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.738 align:middle line:90%
So J-Rod was not an Eben.

00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: All right, Rick.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's jump back into
the Cronus program.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
We know J-Rod was instrumental
in helping us figure out

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:90%
the science for the skin.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But in the last episode,
we talked about missions

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:90%
with Cronus 2.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's move forward.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:84%
What missions took
place after Cronus 2?

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And were there new versions
of this craft that were used.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Cronus 3 was the
advanced version in 1994,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
as Ben referred to it, as
a brand new model of craft.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It had a different
propulsion system.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
It had a different electrical
system or power system,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and the craft, the outer skin
of the craft, which was a living

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
organism, as we talked
about in Cronus 1 and 2

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:90%
was even more advanced.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Cronus 3 could
house six astronauts

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
rather than just two, expanded
the cockpit area, so to speak.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
It had a different system,
whereby the astronauts of Cronus

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:90%
3 could directly communicate.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
These are humans now, human
astronauts with the outer skin

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
or with the craft itself,
even with the four vector

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
longitudinal pathway device
that was I think was upgraded,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
although he didn't
really talk about that.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
was also updated.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the complex
problem with Cronus 3

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
was training the astronauts,
new astronauts that

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
had been involved
with Cronus 1 or 2

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to be able to communicate
through consciousness

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:84%
with the craft, with the
operation of the craft.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
So that took some time.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I knew all the
different training techniques

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that they used, but I knew that
they used Cronus 1 as a training

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
model to train those
astronauts to meld mind,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
or however they do it, with
the skin to operate this craft,

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.007 align:middle line:90%
Cronus 3 through consciousness.

00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: God, that's incredible.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.507 align:middle line:90%
All right, so moving on.

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
What was the next mission?

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Where was the portal?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Where did they go and how
far in the future was it?

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah, this is exciting.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
The next mission, they had
to get a portal near Venus

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
or somewhere between
Earth and Venus.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And once they got to
it, they entered it.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And they came out 80,000
years into the future.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Whoa.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They went to where
Earth would have been.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:90%
They saw the sun.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:90%
They recognized the sun.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:90%
They recognized the planet Mars.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:90%
But there's no Earth.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Earth was gone.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:84%
In its place were several life
spheres, as they call them,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
huge spheres, transparent
spheres with a ball inside of it

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
that looked
something like Earth.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And they were floating
around the area

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:84%
of where Earth used to be, which
really confused the astronauts.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:90%
Like, are these from Earth?

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Are they human or what?

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, they were able to
communicate through some sort

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:90%
of a frequency.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the craft,
Cronus was brought in

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and Cronus 3 was brought into
one of these life spheres.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe he said they
directed him into a point

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:90%
to get into this sphere.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And once they're
into this sphere,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
then they went and
landed at a location.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.638 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't go into great
details of how they landed.

00:09:02.638 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So they opened up like
a window for them to just fly

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, open a window,
and they brought the craft

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:90%
in somehow.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:10%
And now the problem again,
as we talked about earlier,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:10%
about 4,000 years, this is
80,000 years into the future.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:84%
The English language
is totally different.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there was an incredible
problem with communications with

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:84%
our own species, humans, because
not only did our technology

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
advanced, the language advanced
because of the technological

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:84%
wording explaining the newer
technology, 80,000 years.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can't even imagine
80,000 years in the future.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to
communicate crudely with

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
the earthlings of 80,000
years into the future.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:84%
They again, recognized Cronus
3 as being from the past.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how they did that.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was some sort of a
transponder that even though it

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
was 80,000 years
into the future,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
they still knew that
craft was human.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, they were welcomed in.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
They stayed a time period, not
fully understanding what was

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:84%
explained to them until the
advanced civilization brought

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:84%
someone in to talk
to our astronauts,

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that came down more down to
our level of understanding

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.452 align:middle line:84%
their language 80,000
years into the future.

00:10:34.452 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Let's just
back up a little bit.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So these life
spheres, you mentioned

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:90%
there was an Earth inside of it.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So is it a container around a
planet or no, there's no planet.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.377 align:middle line:90%
It's completely artificial?

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they
think it was artificial.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.660 align:middle line:84%
There was a planet and then
the sphere on the outside

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:90%
was their environmental control.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
The planet was living
inside this sphere.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was referred to me as
a life sphere, is something

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:90%
that is containing life.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge sphere.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not quite as big, as he
said, not quite as big as Earth,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
but enough to hold people.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's obviously some form
of gravity inside that sphere

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:84%
because the people were
living on the planet,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
not up like they were 4,000
years into the future.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it was later determined,
either with the conversation

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
or what was recorded and
translated after they got back.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They had foreseen something
that happened to Earth.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And they built
these life spheres

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.543 align:middle line:84%
to transfer the population
of Earth into these spheres.

00:11:46.543 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said there
were a number of them.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:90%
He didn't give an exact number--

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:90%
5, 6, 7.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
He said there were a number
of them floating around,

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:90%
where Earth would have been.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: God, that's
so fascinating.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:90%
OK, so they enter the sphere.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
They go down to the
planet portion of it.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
First thing I want to know is,
what did the humans look like

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
80,000 years into the future?

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, that's my
one of my first questions.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.263 align:middle line:90%
They were smaller.

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Oh, so we went high,
and now we're getting lower.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.472 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, and
there were more robotic.

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, they were almost
mechanically speaking

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:90%
or mechanically functioning.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, we didn't go into
whether they were a trans--

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
humanized, or a synthetic,
or he referred to him

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:90%
as more robotic than human.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking 80,000
years into the future.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So did we somehow,
during that time period,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
realize that in order for humans
to survive into the future,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
they had to become more
robotic or some sort

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:90%
of synthetic entity?

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
that's the answer.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Then again, how do we
communicate and understand

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:84%
somebody from 80,000
years into the future.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:84%
How do somebody in
the 20th century--

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:90%
this is 1994.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:90%
How do we understand that?

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think that we did.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't go
into great details.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But he said that
they were benevolent.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:84%
They knew they
were from the past.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
They didn't give him
any restrictions.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that they
found with the atmosphere,

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen was a higher
concentration than normal Earth

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
would have been.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:90%
The Earth was about 22%.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's guessing that was
about 26% or maybe even more.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And so they had problems.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
They had to adjust
to that oxygen

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:90%
saturation, the astronauts.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But they accommodated those
astronauts in every way

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:84%
they could and until
they were then sent back

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:90%
through the Quantum Core.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.247 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How did they confirm
that Earth was destroyed?

00:14:04.247 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:90%
How was that communicated?

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: They explained it.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
The person, the robot, or
whatever you want to call it,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that came in to speak
with these astronauts,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
came down there to their
language, not fully down to it,

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
but he was able to communicate
in a better method and using

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.578 align:middle line:84%
language that the 20th century
astronauts could understand.

00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, interesting.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And explained that
there was a catastrophic event

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that occurred that
destroyed Earth.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And they were
speaking verbally.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:90%
This wasn't telepathy.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.777 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: No, they
were talking verbally.

00:14:40.777 --> 00:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The one question I asked was,
when did this happen sometime

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:90%
in the 80,000 years?

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
If they've been living in these
life spheres for 20,000 years,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:90%
what, explain it.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know the
answer to that.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: What about the moon?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Was that destroyed or was
that still floating around?

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They never
saw the moon either.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
They saw-- they
could detect Mars,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and they could detect
Venus and our sun.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And as far as he could
see, or they could see,

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
or he could relate, there
was no damage to the sun.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:90%
The sun was still there.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Were these humans
80,000 years in the future,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
were they-- looked like
robots, like heavily augmented,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
like an AI machine?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Or did they have
skin and just kind

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.555 align:middle line:90%
of behaved more robotically?

00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yes, that's a good
question because he did explain

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They were human
looking, robotic acting.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And that's why he
referred to him as part robotic.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somehow, and
maybe we can't even

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
imagine how they can
build that into us.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there's some way
of manipulating our DNA

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:90%
to develop a human that has--

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and maybe there's a set of
two or three or four strands.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
There's five strands and one
of those strands mixed in

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
with artificial intelligence
or something to that effect.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.533 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
probably a possibility.

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, got it, got it.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Fair enough.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.607 align:middle line:84%
So how long were they
gone on this mission?

00:16:12.607 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And like the other mission,
did they bring anything back

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:90%
like a tablet?

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.308 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They brought things
back, a number of things back.

00:16:18.308 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
They brought plant life, soil,
and some texts that had built

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
into this device, similar to
the tablet that was given to us

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
by our civilization
4,000 years ahead of us.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:90%
And they brought that back.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
some other objects

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:90%
that he didn't really go into--

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:90%
a fountain pen.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that he saw

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:90%
or they saw was a fountain pen,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really?

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.648 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Which they
thought was a fountain pen,

00:16:52.648 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
which determined not
to be a fountain pen,

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
but he referred to
it as a fountain pen.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It was some sort
of a logic stick

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:90%
that can write into the air.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.881 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you don't need anything.

00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't know
how that worked,

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
but you can write
something with it.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And it appears in
just in thin air.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't know
what that would be used for.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I can think of
things we could use it on Earth

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
And again, it took
a long time for us

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
to understand and examine the
things that were brought back.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't done.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is 1994.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:90%
So it took them--

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.505 align:middle line:84%
took us some time to be able to
analyze what was brought back.

00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Besides the pen, is
there anything else that was

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:84%
interesting you want to share
with us, like the plants, maybe?

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: Well, the soil--

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.610 align:middle line:10%
he said the soil and the
plants were similar to what

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:10%
we had on Earth.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:84%
There's something about the
growth factor was different than

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:90%
our planet in the 20th century.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably because
of the higher concentration

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:90%
of oxygen.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.323 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:57.323 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So the growth factor
in plants would be different

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and that would only make sense.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a botanist
or a geologist,

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.396 align:middle line:84%
but I could understand
that that probably

00:18:08.396 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
could change and make the growth
factor of plants or even animals

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.115 align:middle line:84%
They didn't bring back
any animals, though.

00:18:16.115 --> 00:18:18.495 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And just to follow-up,
how long were there for?

00:18:18.495 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: About nine months.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And then back on Earth,
that was about nine months.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The total
time, nine months,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.037 align:middle line:84%
going and coming
was nine months.

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And then back on Earth,
was it about nine months that

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:90%
were perceived by us?

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, cool.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Which I still
can't understand that.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah, yeah,
it's a little confusing.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not for us to decide.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: No.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So all
right, moving on.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So unless there's
anything else you

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
want to say about that
incredible journey,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:90%
I know there's more, right?

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:41.485 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's move on.

00:18:41.485 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the next
mission you want to tell us.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, the
next was Cronus 4.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Cronus 4.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: With
cooperation from J-Rod.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, at this
point, his home planet.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They assisted us in Cronus
4, which was the craft

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.992 align:middle line:90%
that Ben actually flew in.

00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:84%
This astronaut I'm talking
to, highly advanced.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It had fauns, which were
remote-piloted vehicles that

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
could go down to the
planet, while the Cronus 4

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
stayed in an orbit around
the planet if they found one.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:90%
The faun was completely robotic.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It would go down in search
and examine a planet.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
He said it was like
going from a 1928 Ford--

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure most
people can imagine

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:90%
what they would be like--

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%
to a 2004 Mercedes.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
State of the art
everything in that.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But one thing they still
experienced, even though they

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
had different suits and
helmets, was the pixelization

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:90%
going through the portal.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But they figured out a way to
help the astronauts cope with

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and endure that travel through
the portal and the pixelization

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.935 align:middle line:90%
that they're suffering from.

00:20:05.935 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, I think it's just
important for the audience to be

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:90%
clear on this.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Up to this moment,
Ben was recounting

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:84%
the history of the Cronus
and the MINOT programs.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.280 align:middle line:84%
But this on Cronus
4 was the craft

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that Ben actually piloted
through the portals.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yes, you're
absolutely right.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
2004 is when Ben first took
his mission on Cronus 4.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:10%
He had been training for
years before that, six years,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:10%
but he hadn't been on anything
other than test flights

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:10%
or practice flights on the
Cronus 3 and a Cronus 2.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But his first actual mission
outside our solar system

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:90%
occurred on Cronus 4.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So now he's telling me
first hand experience

00:20:54.890 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
of what he endured flying in
that Cronus craft with Cronus 4

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:90%
with the other five astronauts.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Because there were six
astronauts now in the Cronus 4.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: That makes
me feel at ease.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
More people, the better,
that's an intense situation.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.438 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
do the same thing.

00:21:15.438 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Where was the portal?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And how many years
in the future?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, this is an
interesting mission because his

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
very, very first mission
was to the Pleiades.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They
picked up a portal,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and I believe he set
out towards Jupiter.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not
really sure about that.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
There's so much information
that he was getting from him,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
that there was some bits and
pieces that I should have gone

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
back and asked, but I didn't.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, they went
through the portal.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:10%
And the way they
endured the portal,

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:10%
they learned from past
experiences over the 20

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:10%
some years, was to put
the astronauts to sleep,

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:10%
so they didn't experience
the pixelization

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:10%
going through the portal.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:90%
They wake up outside.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they did that.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And now, he's at the Pleiades.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:90%
He's going to Taygeta.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's the star where
J-Rod's home planet is located.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's a lot he
left out because I believe

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:10%
there was something to do
with J-Rod maybe going back

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:10%
to visit his planet,
but he didn't

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:10%
go into a lot of
details about that.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I wish he would have.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, they got
to the planet, they

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:84%
were able to communicate
with the planet,

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and they were able
to circle the planet.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And although they didn't go down
and meet with the Pleiadians,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
they did send a faun
down more or less

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
as a test to make
sure it was safe.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:84%
They were orbiting Earth
days, our Earth time period,

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
about 60 days.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were gathering
electronic signals, pictures

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and other things,
other type of technology

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that they could gather
from the atmosphere

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and photographs of
the planet itself.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:10%
They were looking for whether
there was any type of radiation

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:10%
shields, whether there
is a magnetic field

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.195 align:middle line:10%
around that planet,
things like that.

00:23:24.195 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:10%
That's what they were after.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:10%
And then they were able to then
grab their cord and go back.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.333 align:middle line:84%
In total, time away
was about nine months.

00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: You described this
like it was present day.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So was this portal they
took to the Pleiades,

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
was it in the future or no, It
was they just jumped in space

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:90%
to a new place at present time?

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I don't know for a
fact, so I don't want to say.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And I kept asking him,
was J-Rod on board?

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:90%
And he would never answer it.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:90%
And I think J-Rod was.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I tell you if I was J-Rod and
you're going back to my home,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:90%
I want to go with you.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Right.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.973 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Maybe I don't want
to stay because I like Earth

00:24:02.973 --> 00:24:04.182 align:middle line:90%
or maybe something like that.

00:24:04.182 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:90%
But I want to go with you.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
that that happened.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to let the
viewers think that J-Rod

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:90%
went back to do whatever.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But the question that
you ask and the question that I

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
ask was, it has to
be in the future.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Because if
you go to the portal,

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:90%
you're in the future, right?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe not.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's some other way.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, this craft
was entirely manufactured

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:90%
by the Pleiadians off-planet.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
It had everything
inside the craft

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:90%
belonging to the Pleiadians.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So our astronauts
that were trained--

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.385 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that Ben told me was--

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, I said,
well, how much time

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:84%
did you have training
in that craft.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Because any pilot, I
mean Air Force pilot,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.920 align:middle line:84%
he was an Air
Force pilot before.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
You have to get in a plane and
you start it, T-37s, T-38s.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We trained in that craft in
that off-planet location.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, whoa,
wait a minute, Ben.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:84%
You went off-planet to
train in this craft?

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, because
it was manufactured

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:90%
on an off-planet location.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I'm sorry, I can't
tell you, Rick, what planet that

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:90%
is or where it was.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
He made a mistake
by saying planet.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So there had to have
been a planet someplace.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So did he go back to the
Pleiades or did he go--

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:84%
is there a planet
in our solar system?

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Is that what-- maybe
that is what is

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:90%
on the dark side of the moon?

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Is that on Pluto?

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Is that on Mars?

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that on Titan?

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.297 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Oh, I hope
we find out one day.

00:25:46.297 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So when Ben and the
other astronauts

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
were circling the
planet in the Pleiades,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.685 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned that there was
communication back and forth.

00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain more?

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Give me more details
on what that was like.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He did say that they
were able to communicate with

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiades, the planet.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think he named
the planet by number.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a number planet, maybe
six or something like that.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't go into
any details about what

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:90%
they called that planet.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, he said there was
a form of communication

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.510 align:middle line:84%
on a particular frequency
that they could talk.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:10%
And now this is where--

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:10%
there was some confusion
in what he told me

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:10%
and what I thought
I heard from him,

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:10%
was that they had a way of
communicating through voice.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm thinking it was J-Rod.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't say that.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to infer
that J-Rod was aboard.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:90%
But I think he was.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I think all indications of how
he said what he was saying.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to protect
J-Rod for some reason.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if J-Rod,
if you can get--

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.070 align:middle line:84%
why not take a ride back
home in this if you're

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:90%
going on this journey.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.543 align:middle line:84%
So I think probably J-Rod was
the one that was communicating.

00:27:02.543 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what I would
like to think.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah, that
makes total sense.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.295 align:middle line:84%
And then last
question about this

00:27:06.295 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:84%
is they sent the faun down, this
autonomous robotic craft down

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:90%
to the planet and back.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Did it get messed
with in any way

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
or did it just come
back totally fine?

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians totally
OK with a probe

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:84%
coming down to their planet,
checking them out, and then

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:90%
coming back to the craft?

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.040 align:middle line:90%
They were fine with everything?

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, he said that
they sent the faun down there

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:90%
and to interface.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
what that means.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But there was no
indication that there

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:84%
was any harm done or damage done
to the faun when they brought it

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Fair enough.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Did they go anywhere
else or did they just

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.690 align:middle line:90%
hover around one planet?

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: No, there were several
planets within that star system.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were tasked with
looking at these other planets.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Three of them had
life, life forms.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, two of
those life forms

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
were not capable
of space travel.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I don't understand that
exactly, whether it was

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
they were crude
lifestyle or they just

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.040 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to do that.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a lot talk
about that, those planets.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But there was one planet that
had some kind of a civilization,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:84%
was intelligent life forms,
but entirely different

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:90%
bipedal human.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, they sent
the faun down to it,

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and it was down
there for some time

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:84%
exploring, although there
wasn't any hostilities directed

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:90%
towards the faun.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They could tell that there
was no communications

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
possible with these
other life forms.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's saying
these life forms

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:84%
are similar to what we would
refer to as an octopus,

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
but a land-living octopus,
not a water aquatic octopus.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:90%
They looked similar.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a
faun down there.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:90%
They didn't go down.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they realized
that there was no way

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with this
particular creature.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:90%
So they came back.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
only three planets

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.795 align:middle line:84%
that they explored
while they were there.

00:29:09.795 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So these
land octopuses,

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:90%
were they advanced in any way?

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:84%
When you say civilization,
was there buildings and boats

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and ships or were they more
nomadic and kind of like--

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, Encino man?

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They were
similar to being nomadic.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
They didn't see any
living or built structures

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:84%
or any infrastructures
on that planet.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things he kept saying

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:39.170 align:middle line:84%
was, even though that
faun was a robotic faun,

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:90%
it was a landing craft.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:84%
These living organisms
didn't consider it a hostile,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
didn't try to attack
it or anything.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they were
intelligent, but they just

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:90%
couldn't communicate with us.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, very interesting.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: He mentioned that.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So is there anything
else you want to mention about

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:90%
this amazing journey?

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He thought it was the
most sensational time of his

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:11.430 align:middle line:84%
life because it was-- other
than training missions,

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.720 align:middle line:84%
he's going to another planet,
seeing things that he'd never

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
dreamed of seeing, although
they were very well trained

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.200 align:middle line:90%
for anything.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But he says, we sat and
talked amongst ourselves,

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.920 align:middle line:84%
the astronauts, about what
they were experiencing.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
out of this world.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually out of
this world and of the experience

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:90%
that they endured.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, even though
we didn't experience

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
the trauma of going through
the portals like some

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:84%
of the other astronauts
because they developed a system

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:84%
to keep us from experiencing it,
he would have gladly done this

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:90%
again over and over again.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.425 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah, that's incredible.

00:30:54.425 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
you-- is there any takeaways

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.180 align:middle line:90%
that you'd like to share?

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, one of the things
that we didn't mention in other

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
episodes was these Cronus
1, 2, 3, and 4, they--

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.550 align:middle line:84%
they weren't only
used for one mission.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We only talk about one mission.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
They were used for
many, many missions.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We only talked about
the one major missions

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:90%
that they were involved with.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And Cronus 1 was considered
a training spacecraft.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
training done in that craft.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So I just want the viewers to
know that these crafts weren't

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:90%
made just for one mission.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:36.210 align:middle line:84%
There were many missions flown
outside our solar system,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.340 align:middle line:84%
within, and outside
our solar system,

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.405 align:middle line:90%
using these four Cronus crafts.

00:31:40.405 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And right now is
the latest craft Cronus 4?

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.735 align:middle line:90%
Or are we beyond that now?

00:31:44.735 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He wouldn't
discuss that,

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:84%
but I believe there
probably are 5 and 6.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.122 align:middle line:84%
I think they're probably at
least because this is 2004.

00:31:52.122 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah,
that's 20 years ago.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It's 20 years.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure that we have more
advanced than that, although he

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.610 align:middle line:90%
didn't talk about it.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.443 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, Rick, with
all that being said,

00:32:01.443 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
we have Congress right now
interviewing whistleblowers,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
learning about the basics
of some of UAPs, right?

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.960 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking
about is so next level.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.633 align:middle line:84%
Like, where do you
think this is going?

00:32:11.633 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And does Congress
know about this?

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, do you think
they even know

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
any of the stuff you're
telling me today?

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Or are they still being
told just the very basics

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.247 align:middle line:90%
about these black programs?

00:32:19.247 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's a good question.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:84%
I think some within the
government probably no.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:32.640 align:middle line:84%
How do you hide $20 trillion or
$25 trillion, or $36 trillion

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.760 align:middle line:84%
that's missing from the
defense budget since 1990.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:90%
The money went somewhere.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, in order
to build these crafts,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.430 align:middle line:84%
there has to be defense
contractors involved

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:90%
and other people involved.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So they use that money
that's missing or unaccounted

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:84%
for, however you want to say,
to build these advanced crafts.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:84%
There were people
within Lockheed

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:84%
have been talking about
this for many years.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, a person
came out from Lockheed

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and told us they had crafts
that could go to other worlds.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:10%
And 2010 at a UFO
Convention, the guy

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:18.210 align:middle line:10%
who worked for NASA
got up and said,

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:10%
we have crafts locked away that
can go to remote planets in I

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:10%
think he said a flash of a light
or something to that effect.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's been out there,
but nobody believes it.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to believe it.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:84%
There are people
within Congress.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
a few, not a lot,

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure there's
a few in Congress that

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:84%
know about the secret space
program and what we have

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and what our capabilities
are to travel

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:84%
not only within
our solar system,

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:55.270 align:middle line:90%
but outside our solar system.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: We can take ET home.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: We can take ET home.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: And we may have.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.137 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: And we may have.

00:34:02.137 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Wow again, Rick, this
was a fascinating conversation.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Good to be here.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Josh.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Thank you, folks.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:90%
