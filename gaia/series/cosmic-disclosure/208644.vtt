00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure" we're with Tim,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me, Emery.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things I would
like to have the audience

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
understand is all the
levels of consciousness.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we could go through those.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically every model is
wrong, but some are useful.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So it is a fluid process,
and different levels

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
can have a full, harmonized
level of consciousness, which

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
means you're at the
perfect, best level

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:90%
where everything unfolds.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But everything in
between is kind of fluid.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So someone can be on
level three consciousness

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and be on the lower end of it,
or at the higher end of it.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So level one
consciousness basically

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
means that there's
only an awareness

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:90%
that something is there.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about, for example,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
minerals or a stone
or this planet

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:90%
itself, those are living beings.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
living beings,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
but their consciousness
is pretty much

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
the same consciousness that
we have in source itself.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:90%
It's awareness of being.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
A individual or
consciousness unit

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:84%
normally goes through different
levels from that point on.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So at level two
consciousness, we

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:84%
have beings that know that they
exist, but they do not tend--

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
or they do not have
an I awareness,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
which means they do not know
how to define themselves

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
as an individual.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
That basically applies
to, for example, animals.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But we need to be a little
cautious about that,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
because animals can as well go
to level three consciousness.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So level three
is a self-awareness.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> A level three is
level of I awareness.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I awareness.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So a dog could either have
a level two consciousness,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
which means he's just a dog,
and he's aware of the basic

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
fundamental necessities of life,
like where do I get my food,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
how do I survive, which is
a huge struggle to level two

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
consciousness beings, or how
can I mate someone or something?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So these are the basic forms
of necessities and thoughts

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that a level two
consciousness has.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Or the dog could
also, because it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
is in contact with a level
three consciousness, which

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
is his human, be evolved
into a state of I awareness,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, yeah.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good boy.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm-- I don't know--

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:90%
Buddy, the dog or something.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So that would make an
I awareness to a dog.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And we see that a lot
in the animal kingdom.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of species that have
close contact to humans,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
for example, they pick up on
those routines, those patterns.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:90%
They learn and experience.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Even-- and I might add that
even if the connection between

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:90%
humans and animals--

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, humans are
animals, but some

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
evolved form of that is
kind of denaturalized,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and humans always want
to be a top of that,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:84%
so it's sometimes kind
of toxic relationship.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, even if
we're talking about

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:90%
animals in zoos or in--

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
kind of environment--

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
the species still
benefits from that, even

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:90%
if the individual is suffering.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Please continue on
the definition of levels,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and where do humans
actually live?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Humans used to be pretty much
on level three consciousness,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
which means it's the
I awareness of, oh,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that's me in the mirror.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And large parts
of the population,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
they used to be in the
lower parts of the level

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
three consciousness,
which also picks up

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:84%
on the problems of
level two consciousness,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:84%
like survive, struggle, and
being very focused on mating

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
with someone, and
where's my food?

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can
experience that a lot

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
in cultural
development of Earth.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people still have this
life is about how to survive,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and a very deep focus
on sex and food.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Those are things that you
can find that significance

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to the human race like
a lot, everywhere,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
like people doing
photos of the food or--

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- go out in
order to mate someone.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So these are lower
levels of three--

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:90%
level three consciousness.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
When we get higher to
that, people realize, oh,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:90%
that's not so much struggle.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They can theoretically
understand that there

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:90%
is something after death.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:90%
It's going on.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:90%
There is no actual--

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's no actual
death or something.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
That's something
they can grasp upon.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And those are the higher levels
of level three consciousness,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.700 align:middle line:84%
which eventually will lead to
level four consciousness, which

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
means I have experienced
that we are connected.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I have experienced that
I can change my reality.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I can have telepathic
thoughts with people

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that are close to me and I
feel in my heart or something.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something
strange happened.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe someone has an encounter
of some kind of another.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
We also see that in
level four consciousness,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
all this wondrous
technology arise.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Like we don't need to be
stuck to fundamental mechanics

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, but we can
go to quantum level physics.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Those things are happening in
the lower phase of level four

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And while Earth is now heading
towards a change, a shift

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, people
will be aware of a lower

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness--
level four consciousness--

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:84%
which means they
will acknowledge

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:90%
that there's more to life.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:84%
There are technologies
that are non-invasive.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Things get more fluid.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
There are other life
forms, other potentials.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Everything is more open.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, no one is
locked to the consciousness

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:90%
of the collective.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
understand that we

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
are consciousness itself,
they can ascend to any level

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:90%
instantly.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It still needs some experience,
some braveness to go that way.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to go with the
flow of the collective.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have collectives,
especially ape species are

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:90%
super reliant on collectives.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
In level four, an observer
or a consciousness unit

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:84%
becomes aware of being
more wondrous than it

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
used to be on the lower
levels of consciousness.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
By that, and through that, a
lot of advantages and a lot

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:90%
more opportunities will come.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Because once you realize that
reality is more fluid than you

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
might think, also
fear and anxiety

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%
will disappear in a lot of ways.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, you realize that
nothing does not exist.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot die.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
You can die, but
you're not dead.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that occurs
to people on the lower ends

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.210 align:middle line:90%
of level four consciousness.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
They realize that death is a
transformative experience that

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:90%
will bring you somewhere else.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's also a kind
of higher elevated way

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:90%
of perceiving the world.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's also not only
level four consciousness,

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
but there is also a
level four dimension,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
which means the space there
is different than the space

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:90%
in level three.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
A level three space
will mean that it's

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:84%
kind of hard to manifest
a pure level three space--

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't give you the opportunity
to change your reality

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:90%
by conception or something.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It also could not
display beings that

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
are aware of level
four consciousness,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
because a being from
level four consciousness,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
a perfect level
four consciousness,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
could use his own psionic
and own awareness in order

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:84%
to modify reality in a way
that is good for him, her, it.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So when that being would
enter a reality of level three

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that would technically
not be possible.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Earth has been on level three
and level four simultaneously.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So it could display both times,
which explains why some people,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:90%
for example--

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- yogis
in India or something,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
they experience very
profound shifts of reality

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
through meditation
and something.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Some parts of the mainstream
population, they won't.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:90%
They just don't realize that.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:90%
They could.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:90%
They could.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:84%
When they get in contact with
maybe a guru or something,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that would elevate their
consciousness as well,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because the field around
what that consciousness

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:84%
unit projects out will also
affect the lower consciousness

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But dimensions that have
level four consciousness

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
will be more fluid, more
energetical, more wondrous,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:90%
more opportunities.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a little challenging
to explain what level

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:90%
five consciousness--

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:84%
at least the dimension of
the space of level five

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:90%
consciousness-- is.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Because a consciousness
unit will still

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of
body perception.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's not that rigid,
as in level three.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:84%
A level five being
is more energetical--

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
energetic in a way that it
doesn't need a body in a way

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that materialistic world view
of level three consciousness

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:84%
tells you that it
needs that body.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
It still has a body, or
at least a conception

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
or a concept of body, of
awareness of body, which we'll

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:90%
stick to that consciousness.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And unit you have still
body and eye and soul

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:90%
included in that triad.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So a level five
being would not be

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
able to be displayed on
a planet like Earth that

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
has only level three
and level four--

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
used to have level three,
and is now in level four.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Things will change a little bit.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Because through that
elevation and shift on Earth,

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.450 align:middle line:90%
reality will shift as well.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
right now happening.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
What has happened
in the past when

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
a being that is irradiating
level five consciousness

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
would influence Earth, the
material physical phenomenon

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
that a human would
experience is, for example,

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:90%
a ball of light.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So that explains a
lot of those balls

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
of lights that are hovering
and having some effects.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be
something different.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, a
human that experienced

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:84%
the presence of a level five
being could, for example,

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
experience something
that they interpret

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
as ghost or paranormal
phenomenon or something.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Because it is not as easy to
be displayed on this Earth.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the way a
human would experience

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and perceive that
experience is determined

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:90%
by the cultural thinking.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the brain-- the
brain, the human brain,

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
doesn't like lost information
or non-existent information.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And then it will put in
some placeholder into that.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So people will, for example,
experience their dead grandma

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that dead
grandma is in the room,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:84%
but something is in the
room-- a presence that

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:90%
might be level five awareness.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> A level five, now,
does not have 3D body.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.525 align:middle line:84%
It's a level five
body, which is--

00:13:59.525 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You explained it
as a ball of light.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the way a lower
consciousness would perceive

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Would perceive a level five.

00:14:08.602 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it's like having
a 4K video material,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and you display it on a 1950s
television set, and you only--

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
you lose a lot of data.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
You can only perceive black
and white screen, instead of

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
this colorful, shiny 4K being.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So what people will
perceive is some orb

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:90%
of light going somewhere.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But that is typically a level
five consciousness life form.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So things in level
five get pretty weird.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's also pretty open to the
observer to the consciousness

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:84%
unit in order to decide
what kind of space

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:90%
they will inhabit.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
People are attracted by
so-called cosmic adhesion,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
which means there are inherent
forces that will attract things

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:90%
that stick together.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And if frequencies change,
they will go somewhere else.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
That is the way the
fifth dimension,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it
that way, a level five

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
dimension or space, feels like.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It's more awareness of being
energy instead of awareness

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of being something else
materialistic or something.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:90%
But still, there is a past.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
There is a memory of past,
which means I have gone

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:90%
through some way to come here.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:90%
I have some past.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I am still a personality
in that room,

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and I have a history, which
means some logic has brought me

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
here, which is super
interesting to realize,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know
where you came from

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:90%
and how you came here.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
People have told you
that you were born.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Someone else outside
of you has given you

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
the story and some
real life experience

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that you went through, that
you were a baby or something

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:90%
and you grew from that.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:90%
But did you experience that?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:90%
We just-- we're here.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:90%
We are just here.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But still, we have this kind
of information in the system

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that at some point we
were born and we grew

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:90%
and we became what we are.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is the history, which
is still alive in level five

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the difference
between 5D and level 5?

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You could stack up dimensions,
especially mathematically.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is no concrete
order to what is a 5D.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
It just means you have
another point of information

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:90%
to localize where something is.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:84%
A level five space is
something that can display

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
and inhabit beings
that have the awareness

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
on level five.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:90%
It's their habitat, so to speak.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
While dimension just means that
you can have different points

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:84%
mathematically to
stack together in order

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to have a more precise
localization of something.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Can a level five being travel
to level four or level three?

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything is
connected with each other.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So there is some
kind of fluidity,

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
but it comes to the point of
displaying and interpreting

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:90%
data and information.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So a being that radiates
a presence of level five

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
has a lot more memory than a
level three body and awareness

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:90%
could grasp.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So that means yes, a being
five could go to Earth and--

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Manifest into a human.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>> --manifest in things, right?

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But if they are coming in their
own presence and the form they

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
perceive themselves, it is
not possible for a level three

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
awareness to grasp that
and to interpret it.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly putting their
own information into that.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
It's placeholders in order to
have something experienceable,

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
like light or a ghost
or grandma or something.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
The typical way that level
five beings come to Earth

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
is by so-called
reincarnation, which

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
means they also go through this
allegedly being born scenario

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
narrative, that
someone will tell them,

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, I went through nine
months of pregnancy

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:90%
in order to have you.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so that also
bears some dangers

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of getting lost in the
karmic experience, which

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
means a reincarnated
level five being could get

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
lost there-- could say,
oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I am now.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
They could forget what they
have experienced before.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:90%
And that happens a lot.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So there might be a
lot and lot, like we're

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
talking about, at least hundreds
of thousands of human people

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, as least as I am
aware, probably even more, that

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:84%
came from a higher perspective
like level five consciousness,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
went down on this
planet in order

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to have it ascend in
some ways, but got lost

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.035 align:middle line:90%
in the overall struggle of--

00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:51.683 align:middle line:90%
>> They started remembering--

00:19:51.683 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> --human experience.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --of the human experience.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:84%
The level six of
consciousness is the awareness

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
of nothing, which is
basically, the best to put it,

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:90%
the realm of death.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It means no existence,
no time, no--

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:90%
it means basically nothingness.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> When you die, are you
saying that you become

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:90%
a sixth-dimensional being?

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Two ways.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So-- at least two
ways, two main ways.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
There are many,
many possibilities

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that could happen if you die,
because that's a catalyst.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And there are species that are--

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:84%
their only job is to create an
afterlife experience in order

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:90%
to make it more fluid.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Because as we are becoming
aware that we are always here

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and always have been here
and always will be here,

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
we realize that there is some
fluidity to our existence.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
We do not need to have
a strong catalyst.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But in some way or another, and
that is something that Being 6

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
said, death is kind of
a present to the source,

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:90%
to the consciousness unit.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because it can have
a strong catalyst

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
effect that you can go from
one experience to another.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
That is not the way
reality is, actually.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
already everything.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:90%
We are here.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So we don't need death to
be a dramatic experience.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's already happened.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's already happened.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'd like
to add, because you

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
were asking if people can
transform by going into level

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:90%
six consciousness or dying.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So basically, someone
who dies could either

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
go to level four
consciousness, because there

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
are beings that create some
kind of subspace, where

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:84%
when the I gets removed from
the materialistic, body,

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that they go inside of
this, what people could

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:90%
call astral world or something.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
That is the pop cultural term to
a level four dimensional space.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But everyone that becomes
aware of being nothing,

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
being awareness, being just the
observer of nothingness, which

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
means level six consciousness.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Level six, yeah.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone who can access
that can go from level three

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.605 align:middle line:84%
instantly to level six,
because that is what we are.

00:22:29.605 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:90%
We are intelligent energy.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So that sounds like
the end of the story.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, we know that
beyond non-existence there

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:84%
comes something,
because we already

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:90%
are experiencing something.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And that means the moment where
we realize we have no history,

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:84%
there has never been
a birth or something,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
that is just someone inside
of our reality and experience

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of our dream, so to
speak, that came to me

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and gave me the impression
and their perspective of life.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And we become a being
that has no past--

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
no past memory and no I.
And that is level seven.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
While level seven
consciousness is

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:84%
a point where you are aware
of everything and everything

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
all at once, it's
very disconnected

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to the materialistic
perspective that you

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:90%
might have on level three.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like bringing
your consciousness

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
into like almost an ocean
of awareness of being,

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and where you are
connected with everything,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and realizing more and more
that there has been no past.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:90%
There is no future.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of
unfolding and unfoldness.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:84%
That ends in level eight
consciousness, which basically

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
means that everything becomes
so dense, so much packed,

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that the observer and the
observed is becoming unified.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe
becomes unified.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Time, everything-- every
concept, every thought,

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:84%
everything becomes so dense
that it's a unified version

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, we have
an unfolding new version

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:90%
of a universe.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you still an individual
going through those levels

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness all the way up?

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Or are you part of
the collective at that

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:90%
point of the source?

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That is to be decided on.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So look, the decision
of the observer

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:84%
becomes more and more
important, the more we

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:84%
went through these
kind of densities

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:90%
on levels of consciousness.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It means becoming
aware that you are

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
the center of your
own creation is

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
something that will
change the perception

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:90%
of your own experience.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You can, at level five,
still be an individual.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
You can still have a
personality, a realization

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:84%
or a concept of I. But it is
integrated in a collective I

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:84%
system, or a collective
we, more to speak,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that we understand
we are something.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:90%
We have properties to ourselves.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:90%
We have a history to ourselves.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:84%
We are memory-- condensed
memory in that way.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:90%
But we are also this chair.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:90%
We are all the people watching.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:90%
We are everything.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So we are this living paradox
of being a personality

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:90%
while being every personality.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, beautiful.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Tim,
for being on the show.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure, Emery.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Clone is basically
just a copy.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially a
soulless copy of a person.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There are beings
that look like humans,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:90%
which are approachable.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You can talk to them, but they
are not consciousness unit.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And often, when
we go to them,

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
we find that these are rogue,
covert programs that the people

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.357 align:middle line:90%
in charge of know nothing about.

00:26:34.357 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
that they're operating.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But are you guys aware of
any corporations that are making

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:90%
clones for their own agendas?

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.080 align:middle line:90%
