00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired Special Agent,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:10%
UFO-ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Today, we speak about
the real alien hunters.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.895 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What does the Special
Projects, PJ Branch, of AFOSI

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:90%
do, and what is their mission?

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We call it PJs
within the Air Force Office

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.038 align:middle line:90%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm assuming,
not PR rescue.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.872 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No, it's not PR rescue.

00:00:48.872 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:90%
It's Special Projects.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a separate branch
within the Air Force

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Office of Special Investigations
that implements and directs

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
policies and
procedures, relating

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
to compartmented
special access programs,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
and that means anything
that's highly classified.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And most of it pertains to
research and development

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
projects, but it also
can contain operations

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:84%
in the counterintelligence,
counterespionage,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and even espionage areas.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how do they support
the special access programs

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:90%
in the United States Air Force?

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We conduct
investigations,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and we also conduct
disinformation or deception

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
operations to protect
highly sensitive operations

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
in the area of research
and development.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
reverse engineering

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:90%
of some extraterrestrial device.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:84%
We give it to a contractor
to try to perfect

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
or research it to determine
whether we can copy it,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and that operation
has to be protected

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:84%
from outside sources,
foreign intelligence,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
foreign intelligence
influence, or even espionage.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, we implement
policies and procedures

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that can protect
those special access

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:84%
programs, such as deceptions,
deception operations, which you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
would call disinformation
or misinformation

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
operations to
throw off the enemy

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
or throw off the Russians, who
would be our number one enemy.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how
does the PJ branch

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
support the advanced
research and development

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:90%
programs of the US Air Force?

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The Air Force Office of
Special Investigations Special

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Projects Branch supports DARPA
and all DARPA operations.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we have OSI agents,
out-of-the-special projects

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
branch or the PJ branch assigned
directly to DARPA projects.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And those agents,
sometimes teams of agents--

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
type of operations--

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and these teams
of agents support

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:90%
that particular project.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Reverse engineering
or development

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of some kind of a new aircraft
or a new drone system.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the information
that the contractors get

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is strictly controlled by the
OSI projects, Special Projects

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Branch, meaning
that it's piecemeal

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
that the information is
piecemeal to the contractor

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:90%
as they need it.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:84%
As they need the information,
it's given to them.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't always
work in some areas,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
as we were discussing earlier,
because the contractor,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:90%
themselves, they develop--

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
they're working with these
reverse engineering projects,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
this alien artifact, this
box, this widget that

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
came from some
extraterrestrial race.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're delving into it, and
they're learning more and more

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
They learn that this
box opens this box.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It opens this box.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
None of that
information is going

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to be shared with the PJ Branch
because they're developing it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
on their own, and
they're classifying it

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
under Department of Defense
Industrial Security Programs,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
which they're supposed to.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But they don't always
share that information,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's the dilemma
that we have now.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And who's that up
to that it's not shared.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't they sharing it?

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, there's a lot
of inequities in the law

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and within the Department of
Defense Industrial Security

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Program.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The contractors
have to safeguard

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
all the classified
information, most of it.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a
contractor gets an item.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%
We'll call it a widget.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
That came from an
extraterrestrial race.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And the government
gives it to them.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
DARPA gives it to
them, says, OK, we

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
got this from this
extraterrestrial race.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:90%
We need to reverse engineer it.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So you guys need to
figure out how we do that.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Simple as that.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:90%
So they do it.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And along with that, they're
given manuals or information

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that is all classified,
that the government knows.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, once the contractor
gets that information,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
they start doing their job, but
they're developing information

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
as they're trying to
reverse engineer it.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
As my example was, this
box, now it opens this box,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:90%
and opens this box.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, we got three widgets
instead of one widget.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, we know that
this widget controls this.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And now, all that information
is still classified.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's controlled
by the contractor.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
It's classification
that the contractor has,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
necessarily want to share

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:90%
that with anybody else.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Because DARPA, if they got that
information-- for instance,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
you're contractor A. You're
working on this widget,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and you develop all this
information about this widget.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, you this turn
this over to DARPA.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
DARPA might say, it's too
much for one contractor.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
We have to share it with this
other contractor, contractor B.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So now, we start sharing
it with contractor B. Now,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
contractor A just lost
a lot of information,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and they might even have
lost another contract.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So if the contractor A keeps
all this stuff and, at the end,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
develop something
or reverse engineers

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
this particular
widget, now, they're

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
the prime contractor,
called the prime contractor

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
of any future
reverse engineering.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens within
the contractor community.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And who is
watching the contractors?

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Who's in charge of that?

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it possible
that, sometimes, things

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
do slip out to overseas,
to other organizations

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
or countries?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That's the job of
the PJ, Special Projects.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to develop
policies and procedures

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to protect that special
compartmented information

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that that contractor
is working on.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.545 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Here's the problem.

00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
This OSI agent that specially
trained for special projects,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
they go through the
intelligence operations course.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
They go to classified
other courses.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But most of them are engineers,
and they're not scientists.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:90%
They're college graduates.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:84%
They might have a degree in
political science, like I did.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So all they understand is
the security implications

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and the policies and procedures
that they're supposed

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
to use to protect this project.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But they don't understand
the engineering

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:90%
or the scientific values.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So can they be duped
by the contractors?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.267 align:middle line:84%
Now, as your question
ask, who's responsible?

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, who's
the responsible entity?

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: DARPA.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:90%
DARPA's responsible.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And the project security
officer is working

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:90%
for OSI but through DARPA.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So everything should
be going back to DARPA.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, DARPA, itself, OSI agents
assigned at a managerial level.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So that particular
OSI agents assign

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:84%
as a security project manager
is reporting to a supervisor.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he oversees
each project or per project.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, each project.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you're one
contractor, you

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
could have five
different projects.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, that one OSI agent could
be managing all those five

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I've been in a
situation, out of the area 51,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that it would be impossible
for me to monitor

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
every single thing that these
contractors are doing out

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.792 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you
allowed on that project?

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.042 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, this
particular project

00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
was reverse engineering
a propulsion system.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
The propulsion system,
they couldn't get to work.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
However, they got
the craft to work,

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:84%
so they used another propulsion
system, one of ours--

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
we had developed a nuclear
propulsion system--

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and put on this ET craft
and tried to fly it.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the projects that I'd

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:90%
been a project manager for.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't work.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it got off the
ground, but it didn't actually

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:84%
function the way
they want it to.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we were able to
reverse engineer, at least,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
half of what the ET propulsion
system was and placed in the ET

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.012 align:middle line:90%
craft, and they got it to fly.

00:09:18.012 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you explain
to the audience the amount

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:90%
of people and--

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.075 align:middle line:84%
those projects are split up
just for that one project.

00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are we
talking about here?

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
How many different
contractors involved?

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, that's where
the problem develops.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
people that knows

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
project, the more chance of it

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
getting out into the public.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I'll
give you an example.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
A highly classified project
pertaining to a communications

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:84%
device that we had, an
alien communications device,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
communicate long distances

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
with, from one planet to
another, or from Earth

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:90%
to their planet.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And we were trying to
figure out how it worked.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We were in a very,
very, very early stages.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was a number
of contractors involved.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's Tektronix,
Motorola, many others.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So there was, I think, seven
or eight different contractors

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:90%
involved in this.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're talking
60, or 70, or 80 people.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:10%
But going back a
little bit, we had

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:10%
a fantastic counterintelligence
built up around Area 51.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, believe it or not,
every single prostitute

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that was in Nye County
and in Esmeralda County

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
were on the
government's payroll.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm meaning that we wanted to
know every military person that

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.943 align:middle line:84%
went in to be serviced
by them, and we want

00:10:45.943 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:90%
to know what they were told.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And lo and behold, we had.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
One of our assets or one
of the ladies of the night

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.050 align:middle line:84%
call us and say, we just
had this guy come in here,

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking
about some kind of ray

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
that they could shoot
up to another planet

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and send all these
messages on it.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, that bit of information
is highly classified,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:84%
so we had to go out and find
out who this person was and then

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
track that person down.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, we got an espionage
investigation going on.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And we find the person,
and we confront the person.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And the person's trying
to build up his status

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:90%
with this lady of the night.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:90%
He was a regular there.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: By the way, I
work with ray guns, ma'am.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And so, his prestige,
so to speak.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, number one,
he was a contractor.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.735 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He was fired, obviously.

00:11:40.735 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:90%
A prime contractor.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:90%
He was fired.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
We were able to shut
her down by saying,

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
every bit of information
he gave you is baloney.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And she said,
I've figured that.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
People come in here and boast
about doing this and that.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, all right.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, we got to
get him shut down.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And that information never
did get out anywhere.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
one example of what

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
we do as Special Projects
to protect a special access

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.915 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what are the
most secret investigations

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.307 align:middle line:90%
that the PJ Branch performs?

00:12:11.307 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The most
secret investigations

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:90%
are UFO, UAP investigations.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Incidents that happen
that we can't understand

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
or we can't explain,
such as a landing that

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
occurred at some
particular place

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
near a military installation,
involving military people.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And the ETs wanted
specific information

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:90%
from that military person.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, that would be somewhat
of a counterintelligence

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even a counter
espionage investigations.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's pretty hard to run one
of those cases against an ET

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:90%
race that flies away.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
We can't go in interview them
or go and do any background

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
investigation on them.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So then, we have
to concentrate on--

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The individual.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --the individual that--

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why did they
specifically pick

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.517 align:middle line:90%
that individual?

00:13:00.517 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
He was in the right
place at the right time?

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.808 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's
something, where

00:13:03.808 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
they wanted this to happen
right outside the base.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, a lot of
times, they pick the person

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:90%
because he's military.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And the ETs want to
know what's going on.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:90%
They see us flying.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:90%
They see us flying crafts.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They probably have the most
advanced reconnaissance system

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.787 align:middle line:84%
that any entity
could have on Earth.

00:13:25.787 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why choose a military
police or security police

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
officer, people probably
not briefed on the stuff

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:90%
that we know about.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Why choose them?

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, maybe
a stepping stone.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for us to get
inside of an ETs mind.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
anything about the ET.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how they think.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
they can react,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:84%
or personalities, or
anything like that.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So to try to rationalize
what their behavior would

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
be, where we could with a
KGB agent or a GRU agent,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:90%
wherer we can rationalize.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
data about them.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:84%
We can look in a database and
know exactly how they function.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But an ET race coming here and
asking this particular security

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
policeman-- for instance,
the Rendlesham Forest

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
incident or the Ellsworth
Air Force base incident,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
or the Edwards Air Force base,
or the Loring Air Force base

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
incident-- why they typically
picked that security policeman,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and why they ask
him these questions

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:84%
or asked them to do
something for them,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:90%
we can't understand that.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.957 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were you briefed
on what took place there.

00:14:36.957 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
those questions were?

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, with Loring
Air Force base incident,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
a security policeman's walking a
perimeter in the weapon storage

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And the WSA, of course, is
nuclear weapon storage area.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force doesn't identify
it as a nuclear weapon storage

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And this security policeman
is walking guard duty.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And he sees his craft land.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
He goes up and tries
to challenge it,

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:84%
thinking it's a
helicopter first.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it landed in
a little hilly area,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
northwest of the weapons storage
area at Loring Air Force base.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And he radioed in that
it was a helicopter.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, there's
no helicopters in the area.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:90%
It can't be a helicopter.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So as he walked up, he
sees these two entities

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.180 align:middle line:84%
walking towards him, and
these entities were not human.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And he described him as
large helmets and long arms.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is carrying
some kind of an object, which

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:90%
he thought was a weapon.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, he challenged
them with his M-16.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And he kept challenging.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:84%
They kept walking, and
walking, and walking up to him.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, next thing he
know, his weapon is taken out

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:90%
of his hands, floated--

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:90%
he says, floated away from him.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, he does have, at
sidearm, a 38 caliber handgun.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So he went to reach for the
handgun, but it's not there.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:90%
That went with the M-16.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, he is disarmed.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, he doesn't know what to do.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.812 align:middle line:90%
He's a 19-year-old airman.

00:15:59.812 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does his
radio still work?

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Is he communicating this?

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He's trying, but
there's so many things happening

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
at once, that he's
thinking, now,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
do I have to fight these things?

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're coming at him.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.492 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't have any weapons.

00:16:14.492 --> 00:16:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing he
knows, they're up to him,

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.250 align:middle line:90%
and they carry him away.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't have any
controls of his body.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:90%
He can't move his arms.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:90%
He can't talk.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to shout for another
security guard at some distance

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
That security guard did see
some of this, all of it.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:90%
And then, there's missing time.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But during this missing
time, he wakes up in this,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:90%
he says, a ball.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to push out of
it, and all he does is--

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.425 align:middle line:84%
there's a solid
fixture all around him.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:90%
He can't move.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:90%
He can breathe fine.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:90%
He's thinking.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
He thought he fell
into something.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But then, he starts realizing
what had happened earlier.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And next thing he knows, a voice
comes to him, kept telling him,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:90%
you're not being harmed.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to harm you.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
We just need this information.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
How many nuclear weapons
are in that storage area?

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:12.994 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my.

00:17:12.994 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, this
voice is as clear

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:84%
as he says, as clear as if
somebody standing in front

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
of him, asking these questions.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, that particular
question would be classified.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The number of nuclear weapons
inside that nuclear weapon

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:90%
storage is classified.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.492 align:middle line:84%
It's classified,
secret, restricted data.

00:17:31.492 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: He wouldn't
even know, probably.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.117 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:34.117 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:90%
He probably wouldn't know.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
He knows how many
structures there are,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
but he doesn't know how
many weapons in there.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:90%
He never answers.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
This question keeps going over
and over and over in his mind.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And he's hearing it.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
He keeps looking around,
trying to find out

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:84%
who's asking this question,
but he can't see anything.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:90%
And he starts kicking.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And when he's kicking, his
feet breaks through something.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So now, he realizes he can get
out of whatever he's sitting in

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:90%
and crawl out of that.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, he can't get
out of the seat.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
His feet is moving, but he
can't get out of the seat.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
He starts panicking, and then
that voice kept assuring him,

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:90%
you're not being harmed.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.460 align:middle line:90%
The voice keeps asking him.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, he responds,
I don't know how many.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm a security guard on
the outside of the area.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many nuclear weapons.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.185 align:middle line:90%
There's 40 or whatever, he said.

00:18:29.185 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember now.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:90%
40, 46 bunkers.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:90%
That's all I know.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And next thing he
know, he says, it's

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:90%
like something dematerializes.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's on the ground,
along the perimeter fence.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And his M-16 is
down on the ground,

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:90%
and his handgun is over here.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And he also had an Alice pack
on, with some cantina thing.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
That, somehow--
he don't remember

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
how that was taken out,
but that's on the ground.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting on the ground, and
he and his flight commander,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
flight chief is standing over
him, asking him questions.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And he stands up, and
he doesn't understand.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
His mind is in a
maze, he calls it.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Not a daze, but a maze.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things
happening in his mind.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, they all leave.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.967 align:middle line:84%
And then, he looks at his
flight sergeant and says,

00:19:22.967 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
just happened to me.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, they are going to
take you to the base hospital.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that the
flight chief told him.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So he got in his back of the
old boxed ambulance, taken

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.993 align:middle line:90%
to the hospital.

00:19:35.993 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What year was this?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.025 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: This is in 1970.

00:19:39.025 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: '70, OK.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And he goes
to the hospital.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
A doctor comes in, and the
doctor seems to know something.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, I understand you
had this horrible ordeal.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And we just want to, first of
all, check you for radiation.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So they checked him
off for radiation.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we have to
scrape under your fingernails.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And he did all that.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we want you
to take a urine test,

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:90%
and they did all that stuff.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And he's laying
it on this table.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, a voice
comes into his head.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Do not repeat what we asked you.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Do not repeat what we asked you.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So now, he thinks
he's going to have

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to go through this
whole thing over again.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:90%
He panics.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:90%
He jumps off the table.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.655 align:middle line:84%
There's a Air Force
medic in there.

00:20:28.655 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And he says, no, no, no,
no, get back on the table.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:90%
You'll be all right.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And he says, this voice, he
keeps talking in my head.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, we'll take care of it.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
They start an IV on
him, and then, I guess,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
they sedated him, and he
ended up in the hospital.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they transferred him
from Loring Air Force base

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to Otis Air Force
base in Massachusetts,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:90%
a hospital there.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:90%
A bigger hospital.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was in a
hospital for days

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:84%
without anybody
asking any questions.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, two
OSI agents came,

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
dressed in suits, identified
themselves as OSI agents,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and said, we're going to take
you someplace to talk to you.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:90%
We can't talk to you here.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So he still had his Air Force
pajamas on, and medical gear,

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:90%
and a house coat.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:90%
And they put him in a vehicle.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.707 align:middle line:90%
They took him to the location.

00:21:18.707 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
They put him in a
room, and they start

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.890 align:middle line:90%
asking him all these questions.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And he answered every
one of the questions.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, what's so ironic
is these OSI agents knew

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
what these questions were
that they were asking.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.973 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it
happened before, maybe?

00:21:31.973 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And finally--

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And finally,
at the end, he

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:90%
says, how come all this stuff?

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Were you out there?

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you're not the
only one that experienced this.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The same question has been
asked over and over again.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's really
no follow-up.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
He had an early discharge,
and he went on to college.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And now, he's still alive, and
he spoke at a UFO convention

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
some years ago, and didn't
go into a lot of details.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
The big question people ask
him is, have they come back?

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Are you still hearing the voice?

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Are you still
hearing the voices?

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.305 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you
still connected?

00:22:14.305 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He says, I'm
still connected to them,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
but they're not asking
me any questions

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not in a position to
answer what they want to know.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our question,
the government's question,

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
my question as an
OSI agent is, why

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:84%
would these
extraterrestrials want

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to know how many nuclear weapons
we had in this storage area?

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:84%
If they're
extraterrestrial race,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and they can travel hundreds
of thousands of light years,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:90%
can't they count them?

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Can't they go in
there and count them?

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Or can't they disarm
them, which, of course,

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
there's incidents
of that happening.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or was
it another country

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that had the ability
to, maybe, seem

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to be an extraterrestrial race,
trying to find out information.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That's very
highly possible.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they did a lot
of investigations in that.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:84%
They thought, well,
was this mask?

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Was this really the Soviets?

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Did they bring something
in from Canada?

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Because Loring Air Force
base is a few miles

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:90%
from the Canadian border.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, the
Soviets had a base

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
inside Canada, secret base,
or something to that effect.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But I think they worked
with security service

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.693 align:middle line:84%
and just dismissed
that information.

00:23:24.693 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The US Congress
has been working with

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
or briefed by a
very small group.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
What is that group called,
and what's their role?

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It's called
Advance Working Group 6,

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's still
highly classified.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So I can't go into
great details,

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.480 align:middle line:90%
but it's a working group.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It's codenamed
Cobra, and Cobra just

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
stood for analyzing
the information

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:90%
that they're receiving.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're working closely with
congressional staff members,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:84%
both on the Senate
side and the House side

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:90%
to release information.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And so far, there's been a
lot of information released.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe there were eight
different propulsion systems

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
that we have gotten from
extraterrestrial races.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
That is common knowledge
to scientists out there.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are
scientists out there

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that are not aligned or
connected to the program that's

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:90%
really talking about it.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I mean, we
know that there's

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
one particular one that
sends out an email thread

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
now and then, or a
lot, which details

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these programs.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And these propulsion systems
are being tested at Area 51

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:90%
in Tonopah.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're being
tested on our crafts

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that we manufactured or
maybe even some ET crafts.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure of that.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're being
tested only there.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:90%
And so, here's the problem.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
People are seeing
this propulsion system

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
other places other than Area 51,
or Tonopah, or the Nellis Test

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:90%
and Training Range.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:90%
So what are they seeing there?

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
They're actually seeing
ETs flying these things

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and not us not testing it.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we're only on the test
and training range doing this.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And there's been--

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I know Richard Dolan did a whole
story about these and about

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:90%
where they were being tested.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff is
being leaked out.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It is public
information now, though.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.438 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It's public
information now

00:25:26.438 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:90%
because it's all in the public.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And these projects, these
different ion propulsion

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:38.210 align:middle line:84%
systems, the nuclear propulsion
system, this kaesong propulsion

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:90%
system, and these others--

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a scientist,
and so I can't explain

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:90%
exactly what these things are.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But these are all things
that we got over the years,

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and some go goes back to
the 1947 Roswell crash

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and the craft that we--

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
the two crafts, the
147 and one we found,

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
of course, Mason 49,
same identical crafts.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.677 align:middle line:84%
We know what type of
propulsion system.

00:26:01.677 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we got a
little bit of help

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
from Ebe out of
the crash of 1947,

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.705 align:middle line:90%
who tried to explain to us.

00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
there, of course,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
is we have to understand
the ET science,

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:90%
and they have to understand us.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And we can't compare
our technology with them

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
understand their science.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's just a dilemma.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's where we are right
now with these propulsion

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.083 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick,
what's the takeaway

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:90%
of this from your perspective?

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: My perspective is
that we, the United States

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:84%
government, has,
in our possession,

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial technology.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
advance that technology,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to reverse
engineer that technology.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
people working on it.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to separate
one thing from on the other.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We want to separate disclosure
from information pertaining

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to technology that we
don't want to disclose,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and that will be the dilemma
during this disclosure process.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick,
fascinating intel.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It's been
my pleasure, Emery.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:90%
