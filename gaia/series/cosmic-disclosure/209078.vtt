>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:10%
we're with Ricardo Gonzalez,
author and researcher for Peru

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:10%
who has experience with
multiple direct contacts

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:10%
with an extraterrestrial
species called the Apunians.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.648 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do we
understand beings of light

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and what is your
experience with them?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:10%
>>GONZALEZ: As you recall,
Emery, on other occasions,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:10%
we've talked about
my experiences

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:10%
with extraterrestrial
contact, including

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:10%
the ability of these beings who
have a human aspect to project

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:10%
themselves as figures of light.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:84%
However, now we are
talking about something

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:90%
completely different.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
entities of energy

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
made of light who could
not necessarily be called

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial entities.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I would venture
to say that there

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
are beings of pure
energy and consciousness

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:90%
who coexist with us.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
had an encounter

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
with this type of being,
it happened in my country,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, during a trip
to the Andes mountains

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:90%
to the city of Cusco.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I had some very
clear, lucid dreams

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
where I saw myself walking
through some caves very close

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:90%
to archaeological ruins.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
go on an impulse.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And I made this trip to Cusco.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
In Cusco, I met a friend, Sergio
Waman, a shaman from the area.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell him anything about
the dream I had which motivated

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:90%
me to travel to the Andes.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to see
Sergio because he's

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
a very knowledgeable
shaman who had participated

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
in other experiences
with us on expeditions.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Then Sergio said to me, I
want to show you something.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you
some caves that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
are very close to some
archaeological ruins.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And I, obviously,
was taken aback

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't told him
anything about my dream.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, I
decided to go with him.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And we traveled to the
heights of the city of Cusco

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:90%
where there are some caves.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:10%
There at the top
of the Mountain,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:10%
there's a very famous
archaeological site

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:10%
called Sacsayhuaman.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:10%
The caves that I
mentioned were very

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:10%
close to those
archaeological ruins.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:84%
As you well know,
Emery, when you

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
go to Cusco, the
pyramids of Egypt

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
or to any archaeological
site, they are full of people.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't a soul there
when we arrived at these caves.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
These caves are known as
Zone X because according

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
to my local sources,
there are people

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:84%
who have been lost
in those caves

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and they are very
strange, magical.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Then the shaman said to
me, let's go into the caves

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and do a ceremony to
connect with the Earth.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Ceremony
of the Pachamama.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Just then, I see
out of the corner

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
of my eye at the bottom
of one of the caves,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
a white light quickly
go by, like a figure.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to go in to see
what it was and the shaman got

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
nervous and said,
no, let's not go in.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:90%
We have to leave.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And I stood very firm and said
to myself, no, I want to go in.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what's going
on, what it's all about.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And I got up and went into the
cave and the shaman said to me,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm staying here.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going with you.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Besides, I have a headache.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was then,
Emery, that I entered

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:84%
that blessed cave, that sparks
began to fly from the ceiling

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:90%
and walls of the cave.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a group of
natural caves there,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
traces of human handiwork

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
as if they had
polished some rocks,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:90%
making some type of beams.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists believe that
the deformation of some

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
of the rocks, or
making holes in them,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:90%
is part of the Incan Empire.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So as I was telling
you, sparks were

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
coming from this cave like
lights, like fireflies,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
A very bright white, as if
they were a very strong static.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a mental vision.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
happening, it was real.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Then a very bright,
dense fog arose

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:84%
from the bottom of
the cave and from it

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
emerged a tall, very
thin humanoid figure.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It was as if that figure were
made of that same bright fog.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I call it a fog,
but it wasn't fog.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a light with
substance, with density.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see features
on this luminous creature,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
only that they had a head
and a kind of human structure

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:90%
with arms.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I stayed completely still.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do anything
except contemplate it.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
This being, or whatever
it was, raised its arms

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:90%
in this position.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
I was doing the same thing.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And it came toward me
and it almost touched me,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:90%
joining its palms with mine.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:84%
The figure was taller
than me and very luminous.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
There were ideas which came
to me from this being, to me.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:10%
It told me something like this:
despite all the difficulties

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:10%
that you are facing
as a human species,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:10%
you should know that you are not
alone, that we other creatures

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:10%
are coexisting with you and
that to the best of our ability,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:10%
we will support you.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And then this figure
disappeared into the bright fog.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
When I came out of the
cave, practically running

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
with my heart pumping
like boom, boom, boom,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I went looking
for the shaman who

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
had stayed outside to tell
him: Sergio, Sergio, come

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:90%
into the cave with me.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Come with me, I want
to show you something.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And Sergio was
trembling, isn't it?

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Shaking, right?

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want
to tell you something.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I want to tell you something.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
stay outside alone.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And I followed you.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I was in the cave and after
seeing you standing there

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
with that tall,
luminous thing, I'm

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
not going to go
back in there again.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that the shaman
had quietly gone with me

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and he also saw the
same creature of light.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
This was my first clear,
definitive encounter

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:90%
with one of these entities.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who are they, Ricardo?

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:90%
And what are they?

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And what messages
did you receive?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Talking about
the nature of these entities

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:90%
is very complex, Emery.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give
you an example so you

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:90%
can see how fascinating it is.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
This experience
occurred in 1998.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:90%
I was a 24-year-old kid.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
thought that the being

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of light that I had seen could
be some luminous projection

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
of some extraterrestrial entity
because I was interpreting it

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
according to my paradigm, to
my knowledge at that time.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
However, when I asked
the shaman, what do

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%
you think it was that you saw?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
He told me it was the spirit of
one of our ancestors in Cusco.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: So who was right?

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.440 align:middle line:84%
The shaman or your
own perception?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: This is
a very good question

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:84%
because contact experiences
are always according

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:90%
to our own perceptions.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Our description is
the same and we both

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
observed the same entity,
but our cultural background,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
our prior knowledge made each
of us interpret in our own way

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:90%
what we had seen.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Now over the years and
with the other experiences

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that I've had with
these beings of energy,

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I now have a clearer idea
of what it was that I saw.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
As I was saying,
while it is true

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial beings
with a tangible body

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:84%
can generate
projections of light

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and one could also have a
vision of a human figure that

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to someone
who has passed,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:84%
or that a person sees a luminous
figure that could correspond

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.590 align:middle line:84%
according to his beliefs to
someone who has already passed,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:90%
who died.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a deeply rooted
belief within shamanism.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
In this case, what we
experienced in Cusco

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:90%
was something else.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.270 align:middle line:90%
A real revelation.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:10%
There are beings
of pure energy who

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:10%
emerge like this, who
were born like this,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:10%
who exist in that form.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:84%
There are not human spirits,
according to shamanism.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And they are also not
aliens projecting themselves

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:90%
as luminous figures.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
They are a type of
consciousness that lives

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:90%
in the vortices of the Earth.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:90%
And they are not in human form.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
That entity used a human form to
establish communication with me

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:90%
so I would feel comfortable.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: When people think
about beings of light,

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:10%
they may think also
they're inter-dimensional

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:10%
or they have some certain
density or frequency.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Not like us, we're 3D.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So how do you describe them?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I believe that
these beings have no human form.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:84%
From what I've learned, not
only from this experience,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:84%
but from similar experiences
that I have lived through

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:84%
over time, they are simply
consciousnesses of energy

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that are not governed by
our concept of space time.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So what they do
when they contact

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
a human is to adapt
themselves and they

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
can take on a human form to make
the dialogue more comfortable

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
so that the witness who
is living that experience

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
will feel more comfortable.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the origin of these
beings is a great mystery.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, the universe is
very well organized on Earth.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
With its own laws, geometry,
manifestations of energy

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
where these types of entities
which are unknown to us

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
could emerge from what
some call vortices.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
These entities predate
the human species itself.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And this has nothing to do with
conventional extraterrestrial

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do they
come into our dimension

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
so that we are aware of them and
are they also from Earth maybe?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Where are they from?

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Maybe they come
from a world parallel to ours,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:84%
as you say, but let me tell
you about a shamanic belief

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:90%
from Cusco.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, the
priests of the Andes

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
who lived in that
region believed

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that Pachamama,
Mother Earth, had

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
some sacred,
special points where

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:90%
the Gods manifested themselves.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.375 align:middle line:84%
The Andean belief suggests
that there are lines of force

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:14.625 align:middle line:90%
that run throughout the world.

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
The Native name for these lines
of energy is seches in Quechua

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and where these seches, or these
lines of force join, huacas,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:90%
sacred places are formed.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So according to this belief
in Cusco and in the Andes,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
in general, in the
huacas, you can

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:84%
connect with other universes
or other realities.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Then these beings of light
flow through the huacas,

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
or these portals,
from another reality.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
In Andean belief, these
beings are also called ñaupas,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
which means ancient ancestor.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
For a segment of
Peruvian shamanism,

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the ñaupas are the
spirits of the ancestors.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But for another
segment of shamanism,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:90%
the ñaupas are something else.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:84%
The ñaupas are considered
wise beings who lived on Earth

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:90%
before humans.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And a very fascinating
detail, Emery,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that will surely interest
you for your research,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
these places where
these entities of light

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:84%
manifests themselves are usually
sites of many reports of UFO

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:90%
sightings.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Two different phenomena,
coexisting in the same site

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.790 align:middle line:90%
and not by chance.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When these beings
of light interact with us,

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
is it some sort of higher
information being downloaded?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GONZALEZ: Yes.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there is a deep
level of information that comes

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:90%
from contact with these beings.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
In the experiences of
extraterrestrial contact

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that I've described before,
for example, with the Apunians,

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:90%
the information is profound.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It is extraordinary,
but different.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
In the case of these
beings of light,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
of energy, who are natural
guardians of the vortices

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, I would dare
call the experience initiatory

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.600 align:middle line:84%
because when entering
these vortices

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like entering a temple.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:84%
A temple that is not governed
by our laws of space and time.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And they function
as true oracles

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:84%
so the level of information
that emerges in these vortices

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
with these beings of light has
that initiatory and spiritually

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:90%
revelatory seal.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And these type of
vortices, of course,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
do not only exist in
the Peruvian Andes,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And it is likely that
someone has lived experiences

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
with these vortices
and with these beings

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and has labeled the experience
as extraterrestrial.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, it was another
even deeper phenomenon.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a connection
with these ethereal light

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:90%
beings and the UFO phenomenon?

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I have no doubt
about that connection.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't dare say that
these beings of light

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
work together with aliens
of physical aspect.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to describe
that kind of relationship.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But what I have
understood is that

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial beings that
are in our reality who manifest

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
themselves through vehicles and
devices in this zone of power

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:84%
are fully aware of the
existence of these vortices

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and their guardians.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And regarding
those vortices, I'm

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:84%
convinced that every approach
of extraterrestrial beings

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:90%
is connected.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm going to tell you
something very interesting.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
In the extraterrestrial
messages that I

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
affirm to have received,
both in my case,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
as well as from others
contacted in Latin America,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrial
beings suggested

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that we go to this or
that place in the world

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:84%
because important information
that we had to know

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
was located in those
places as if we

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
were going to cosmic
information terminals on Earth.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.925 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I traveled all
over the world, as you know,

00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
living extraordinary experiences
guided by extraterrestrials.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Although this sounds like a
dream, a science fiction movie,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
but they led us
to these vortices

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
to meet these guardians.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.300 align:middle line:84%
At first, obviously,
I lived this

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
in a very naive and simple
way like the experience

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I just discussed in Cusco.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:90%
But we came to know--

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and now we are convinced--
that everything is connected.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You called them the
guardians of the vortexes.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:10%
How do they refer to themselves?

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GONZALEZ: That is a very
complex question to answer.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I will try to develop an
explanation because they,

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:84%
although it is true,
do adapt to our reality

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and can assume human
form, do communicate

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
with you through
dreams or in person

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and you listen in your own
language what these beings are

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
transmitting,
usually these beings

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
do not present themselves
describing names or functions.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:90%
They just exist.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And what they tell us
is that they have long

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
been flowing through the
consciousness of vortices.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And they are the ones
who maintain the balance,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
or guard those
manifestations of energy.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So in one way or another,
they describe themselves

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.053 align:middle line:84%
as guardians of the
consciousness of the vortices.

00:16:25.053 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's go
back to the cave

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
when you were inside the cave.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
How did they
communicate with you

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and what did they say, Ricardo?

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: As I said, when
that being of light arose,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:90%
it approached me.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It had acquired a human
form made of that bright fog

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and brought, what I call,
its arms closer to me

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:90%
in this position.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I had
sensations, visions and a voice

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:90%
in my head speaking to me.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
What I felt came
from that entity,

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:84%
which gave me the message I
told you minutes ago, that we

00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:90%
are not alone.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:84%
That in some manner, these
beings have been with us.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the main
method of communication

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that these beings have is
through the dormant faculties

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of our mind, which allows us
to listen, feel and interpret

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:84%
subtle information
because these beings have

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:84%
no brain, no physical body,
no flesh and blood like us.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I would not use the term
telepathy as we know it.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I would call this phenomenon
spiritual communication.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, I'll try
to better explain it

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
difficult. For example,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in extraterrestrial contact,
when we have received messages

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
or had some kind of interaction
with extraterrestrial beings,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
the connection is
felt in a mental form

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:90%
when they have communicated.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure this has happened to
you with your own experiences.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You feel that communication
is more in this area.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But with these
beings of light, it's

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
happening at the same
time in your entire being.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:84%
It is more like a
communion of spirits.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I know this may sound like a
new age thing or too mystical,

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
but I have no better
words to describe it.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:84%
It is a spiritual communication
with beings of light

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:90%
who live with us on Earth.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can we initiate
contact with these light beings

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.210 align:middle line:90%
at will?

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Remember I told you
that the first contact happened

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
at a time in my life
of great innocence

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
because I'd only been
living these phenomena

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
for a few years,
investigating them.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I tried to face the experiences
without overthinking them.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, as the
years have gone by,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
you become more pensive,
more intellectual,

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:84%
trying to discern, to
explain everything.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was precisely,
Emery, that innocence,

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
which in reality was
nothing more than purity,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
that opens something.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I have the feeling that these
beings feel, powerfully,

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
what you are, what
it is that you think.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:90%
And I think I opened my heart.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I innocently turned myself
over to the experience.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to
manifest themselves.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in ancient
shamanic traditions in Peru,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
Gods of the huacas,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.170 align:middle line:84%
the natives fasted
for prolonged periods.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.230 align:middle line:84%
They went through many
purification techniques

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
to deserve to enter those
places in altered states

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
They even made use of
hallucinogenic plants

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
to try to more rapidly
enter into these vortices.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
They use psychotropics to
help their minds to penetrate

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:90%
these other states of reality.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.680 align:middle line:84%
However, what these beings
have somehow transmitted to

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
us is that we do
not need anything

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
outside ourselves,
only our consciousness

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:90%
and our true intentions.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
To open the portals of
the invisible worlds,

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter how much you
jump, dance, what you drink,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
what external things you do if
you don't have an open heart

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and if these beings do not
decide to, no matter what

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:90%
you do, it will be in vain.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
That is why many
researchers who go

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to these types of special places
pursuing an experience almost

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
always fail because these
matters should not be lived

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:90%
as if you were Indiana Jones.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:10%
You have to live them
with humility and respect.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: What do you think their
goal and agenda is, especially

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:10%
when they communicate
with humans?

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.212 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I believe
that there must

00:20:42.212 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
be a very deep purpose for these
beings to manifest themselves

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
to human beings.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in this sense,
the shamans are right, again.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
These beings want to give the
consciousness of the Earth back

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
to us from the sources of
wisdom of the Pachamama,

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:90%
or Mother Earth.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And when we feel alone or
affected by all the things

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that happen in the
world, we may always

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
return to the lap
of Mother Earth,

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to their natural temples, to
their vortices, which in a way,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:84%
touch our lack of knowledge in
an attempt to try to help us

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:84%
become wiser and
more responsible.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
goal of these beings

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
is to reveal to us that there
is this magical structure

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:84%
in our world, connected
to the universe which

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.213 align:middle line:90%
has important information.

00:21:31.213 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo,
why do you think

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
they chose you to have
this personal experience?

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: My
answer is not going

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to be much different
than what I've

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:90%
told you in other interviews.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.520 align:middle line:84%
When we have
spoken, for example,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of my extraterrestrial
contact without falling

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:90%
into a false humility.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a special person.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:84%
The special thing
is the experience,

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:90%
the message, not the messenger.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But in both extraterrestrial
contact, which we've already

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
discussed here and
this phenomenon

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:84%
of beings of light
and vortices, I

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:84%
think these intelligences took
into consideration my ability

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:90%
to reach other people.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how, but these
creatures, these entities

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
felt beforehand that
I was going to reach

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people in the world.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Think about this, I come from
Peru, a poor country considered

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:90%
third world.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
How could I imagine,
being so young,

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that I would be traveling
all over the world sharing

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
this information and
these experiences?

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:84%
This shows that, as
contact witnesses,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:90%
we are not important.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.080 align:middle line:84%
What is important is
the agenda behind it.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how, I swear, but
these beings knew ahead of time

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:84%
that I could reach many
people with this message.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:90%
And look at us now, Emery.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
We're back together
on your show,

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
sharing this information
which I am convinced--

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:84%
beyond reaching
only the intellect

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:84%
of the people who
are watching us now--

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:84%
we're also reaching
their hearts.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very well put, Ricardo.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:90%

different groups of

were involved in our

And this connection we have

civilizations, all that
information is in us.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:84%
