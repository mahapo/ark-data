00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy Cramer
who has participated

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:10%
in a covert military space
program for 18 years called

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:10%
the Earth Defense Force.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Today we are talking
about psionic warfare

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:90%
on humanity and global agendas.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.645 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:36.478 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Thanks
for having me, Emery.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a
psionic warfare agenda

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:90%
against humanity?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:90%
And if so, from whom?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think I would
answer that question or say that

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
more so than a psionic
warfare agenda,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that Terrans and
Earthlings are caught

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a psionic war.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's more of being in
the middle of something

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
more than it is being the
specific target of that thing,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
or that the agenda is against
everybody or every person.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It really is just that
we're the battlefield,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
planets the battlefield the
war is engaging psionically

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:90%
and everyone's in the way.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do you
decipher that if it's just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
through communication or
there's an actual threat?

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's
difficult to assess.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.395 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of--

00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've seen that
misinterpreted in the field

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Constantly.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is because the
nature of psionic warfare

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:84%
is to be evasive
and to be confusing

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and to project illusory things.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So that it doesn't
seem like you're doing

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:90%
what you're actually doing--

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.775 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Or the
attacker is wanting

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to not seem to be doing
what they're actually doing

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and make it look
like it's something

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:90%
different or something else.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Psionic combat becomes very
amorphous and very smoky,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and it can turn into
a lot of things.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And be a lot of
different things.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's tricky to
sort out for sure.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.542 align:middle line:90%
It's very tricky.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So who are
these opposing forces

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that we would be in
the middle of this?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Unfortunately, it's
the Neuschwabenlander Nazis

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.645 align:middle line:84%
and all of their friends
against everybody else.

00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So more specifically
what does that mean, Randy?

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The
Neuschwabenlanders who

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
are leftover Nazis are
going to do like Nazis do,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:84%
which is try to
take over the world

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
because they have an
agenda in which they

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:84%
don't think that anybody
else's ideas should be valid.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't think that anybody
else's genetics should

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
be valid, and they don't
think that anybody else's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
way of doing anything
should be valid as well.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:90%
So they have a--

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
through their own philosophy,
which to impose that,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
upon everyone in the world to
have their vision of the world

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:90%
enacted.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
In which they have some
friends and some allies,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and to which everyone
else is on the other side.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.355 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Those
friends and allies

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:01.852 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrial or human?

00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:03.185 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: There are some Terran.

00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Terrans,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And there
are some countries

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.365 align:middle line:84%
that are supporting and
going with that agenda.

00:03:10.365 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I want to name
names in this case or not,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.377 align:middle line:90%
but, yeah.

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
There are certainly some
extraterrestrial friends,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
but we're mostly talking
about the separation

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
between Allied countries
and a new World War III

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Axis of evil countries.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So let's
talk about this,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
Allies and the Axis.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
who's supporting them,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
like with the
extraterrestrial agenda?

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the earliest
friends that the Nazis had

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:90%
were Draconians.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But as the Draconians
have become

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:84%
less and less significant,
they've become less and less

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:90%
of a strong ally.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So really, I would say
that their major ally that

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
took over that role
of the Draconians

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
as the Draconian empires'
influence here began to fade

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
was the influence
of the Aldebarans.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say the
closest ET ally right now

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:90%
with the Nazis--

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
with the Neuschwabenlanders
are the Aldebarans.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.155 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're
supporting a negative agenda--

00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.655 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: For our humanity?

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:16.455 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:18.899 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's talk about
their physical characteristics

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:90%
for the audience.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So probably take
an average size human being.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.487 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Most of my
experience with them is dealing

00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:90%
with males, not females.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm better at describing
a male physiology.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a normal Terran
male, but with less muscle

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
mass on the arms, less
muscle mass in the legs.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
You see the bones in the
chest, very little muscle mass.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.415 align:middle line:90%
Almost no fat tissue whatsoever.

00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
pale or what color--

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, again, I would say almost
similar, almost exact same skin

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
tones and features as a Terran
human with this exception.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So like the face
would be similar--

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:90%
eyes, nose, mouth, everything.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
From here where my
fingers are back,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
is like if you were to just draw
a bigger mound around someone's

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:84%
head that extended an extra
couple of inches to the side,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
to the back, to the
top from here back--

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that had no hair and looked like
you could see the brain through

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.475 align:middle line:84%
the top of the
skull, but you can't.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.712 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't know
how else to describe that,

00:05:32.712 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
but the brain size is
actually quite large.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.090 align:middle line:84%
They're very
psionically developed,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
but my understanding
is they are also

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
a prime example of what
happens when a civilization

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:84%
species chooses to go up
the spiral of development

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and get to a certain point
and then stop and get lazy.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they
started to devolve.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And so my understanding is
they're about 1,500 years

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:90%
on a devolution scale.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So they have big brains
and a certain amount

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
of psionic ability that
is still significant.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding, it's a
fraction of what it used to be.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So they continue to get
weaker and weaker and weaker

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.748 align:middle line:84%
psionically because
they're getting

00:06:15.748 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:90%
lazier and lazier and lazier.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So their goal continues
to be enslave whoever

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:84%
they can to do all
their work for them

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't actually
have to lift a finger,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and use whatever power they have
left to stop losing more power.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not going on a
good path, let's just say that.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But they are at that
point with what's

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
a priority to them,
willing to work

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:84%
with anyone that has a similar
fascistic authoritarian

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:90%
designs.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
extraterrestrials

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to
advance humanity

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and then these other opposing
forces are trying to stop it?

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Always.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
As I've pointed out
many, many times,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
if this were not
the case, we would

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:84%
have a world that was either
totally great or horribly awful

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and not a struggle
between the two.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:84%
If the bad forces had
no opposing force,

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
we would all be chipped and
living in little tiny cubicles

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
and it would be Orwell's "1984."

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: If the good people
were totally in charge

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and had no opposing
force to them,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
then we would be living
in a fabulous world.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And everything would be great
and there would be no problems.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that neither
of these things is true

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
is how we know there is a
conflict between these two

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as there is
a conflict between these two

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
forces, we will see these
things fighting themselves out.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll know when one side wins
or the other, because then it

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
will shift in one direction
or the other, in totality.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
specifically are they

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
doing to psionically attack
humanity and suppress it?

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Suppression
technology.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:90%
We call them dampeners.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.562 align:middle line:84%
There are psionic dampeners in
the atmosphere in the orbit.

00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For physical
or emotional?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Just to keep
everybody's amplitudes down.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So most people, to
be honest with you,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
if those dampeners
were not in effect,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
would be experiencing
some pretty intense

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
psionically emergent
experiences right now.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.370 align:middle line:84%
The people who are
having those experiences

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:84%
are still having
them, but we're seeing

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
those experiences dampened
and in lesser number

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
than we would be if those
dampeners did not exist.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's through
a collective extraterrestrial

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
group that's doing
it, or is it AI?

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That is a combination
of covert military personnel,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency
personnel, and

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
some extraterrestrial
personnel who

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
are working with that to try
and keep a lid on something that

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
can't keep on forever.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But for the moment,
those people have

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
determined they would
like this lid to be on.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.532 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I want to
go on the record,

00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
special section does not
think that this dampener is

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:84%
good for the planet, that
it's good for people,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that is good for
society, and that it

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:90%
does more harm than good.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So we disagree with
that statement.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And through your
experience what else can you

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:90%
show us about psionic warfare?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Like examples?

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean examples
are case study, after case

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
study, after case
study, including

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:90%
my own personal experiences.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And including my partner's
personal experiences

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:84%
in which we have experienced
this in some cases

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.245 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: You know,
where it's been--

00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's front-line.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Front-line.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.235 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Front-line.

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Tip of the spear.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Punching bag all day long.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's rough and
I talked to a lot

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.910 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
front-line experiences here.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And we are certainly
engaging as a military agency

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and as a military body
against other forces

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:90%
in psionic battlefield.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And let
us explain Randy,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to the audience
what that entails.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I understand
what you're saying,

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk
about the energetics

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
that the attacks
upon you etherically,

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, physically.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And where they are
all coming from.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, well, I mean,
we are constantly working

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:90%
on tracking sourcing for that.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is it's almost
never the same source.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're constantly
tracking different sources,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and having to come up with
different defensive protocols

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
to neutralize the
attack or the attacker

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and/or counterattack
to neutralize

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:90%
the attack or the attacker.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How about on
a global level, Randy,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:90%
with psionic warfare.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:90%
How does that reach the masses?

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Just look
at the crazy level.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.175 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Turn it up, turn it down.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at the overall sort

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
of social anxious crazy level.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's escalated
a lot recently.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that a
tremendous amount of that

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is someone turning a knob up
to increase agitation, anger,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
frustration, and
violent tendencies.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that similar
to scalar in photometry?

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That may be one of
the types of frequency waves

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.117 align:middle line:84%
or wave technologies or
DW, Directed Energy weapons

00:11:22.117 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:90%
that are being used.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's a number
of ways in which we

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
can do that--
microwaves and scalar

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:90%
waves and geomagnetic waves.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds of waves
that can have psionic impact.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now how does the
perpetrator on the other end

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:90%
benefit from all this chaos?

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The psychological
profiling that we have done

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of the mass of people
on the entire planet,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:90%
not just in this country is--

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
there's a big board OK, at
special section headquarters

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that has a map of the entire
planet that breaks down

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
social psychological
demographics,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and psychological
personality types.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So that you can literally
see where people

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:84%
are at as individuals
and how they cluster

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
in groups towards action,
emotion, behavior, belief,

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:90%
so forth.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So what we have
noticed from seeing

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:84%
this is that this continued
level of assault on people

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
to get them to be
angry, to be paranoid,

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to want to act violently
towards their other fellow human

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:84%
beings, who they feel are
maybe doing something that's

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:90%
worth enacting violence upon.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Not saying that that's
true, saying that this

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:90%
has becomes a belief--

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that these people in all of
these various subgrouped,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
various organized ways,
create a complete lack

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:90%
of social cohesion.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Which benefits people who are
trying to make profits off

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
of things that are unhealthy
and not good for us.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
When we know from
looking at that big board

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that if you could get people
to agree on 10 logical truths,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:84%
that they would have to
understand and accept

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that somebody has lied
to them to tell them

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that one of these 10
logical truths is not true.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you could get everyone to
just accept 10 logical truths,

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
we would all vote in the same
direction by like 3/4 to 1/4.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So that we would have clean
air, clean water, fair laws,

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
fair taxation, fair every--
fair, just things so

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that civilization can
function and run itself.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is the utter confusion
that people have about those

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
10 logical facts that would make
life really simple and really

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
clear if we could
just agree on those.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But since there is
a tremendous amount

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
of confusion and propagandizing
to confuse people

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:90%
on those things--

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It hinders
that whole process.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It hinders the
whole cooperative process.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you could just get people
to agree upon those things,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%
we'd all be getting along--

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
which other civilizations
do quite well,

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
if I might throw
that in for a second.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.912 align:middle line:84%
That just say, you know what,
let's not fight over the things

00:14:15.912 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:90%
that we disagree about.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's be solution-oriented
on these 10 things.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they change
their civilization

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and get things done.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So if we could just stop
fighting for 10 minutes,

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
agree on 10 things and
make those things happen,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
then we could change our own
civilization for the better.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this
technology-based

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:90%
or exclusively mentally?

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, there
are psionic amplifiers.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So there are tools in which can
make psionic amplitudes much

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:90%
more focused and much greater.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So it is-- depending on
the evolution of a species,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:84%
will depend on whether they
feel they need an amplifier

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
or whether they are
self-independent to use

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:90%
their own minds.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But most people
at some point when

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
warfare and combat,

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
you want to bring
out your artillery.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So you use amplifiers
to amplify those waves

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.698 align:middle line:90%
to make them stronger.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, let's talk
about these amplifiers

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
because we both have used
them in our experiences.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe in it
because we see exactly what it

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:90%
does with your thought.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So probably the
coolest amplifier

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I ever used was a telekinetic
amplifier, which is basically

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.306 align:middle line:84%
like a glove that
you wear that has a--

00:15:28.306 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of a magneto, like
a coil that is front and back.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So that it creates this really,
really elevated magnetic field

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:90%
around your hand.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And it makes your hand
feel like it's inside

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:90%
like a ball of Play-Doh.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it creates an
amplified telekinetic wave out

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:90%
of the hand.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So that I could knock you
out of the chair from here,

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:90%
but that's all amplifier.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't be me
having to go-- mm, at all.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It would
just be all amplifier.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it would be like
having a fire hose.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Feels like a fire hose--

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --spraying
out of your hand.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.913 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I like what
you said about it

00:16:14.913 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:84%
feels like a ball around
you because that's

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:90%
the field of energy.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That it's palpable.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.267 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it is.

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:90%
It's so palpable.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.545 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Even though your hands
are right here, you have this--

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.787 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember just
like moving my hands around.

00:16:28.787 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Going, whoa, that
feels so weird.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Like it felt like a big giant--

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Tingly gloves
on my hand that were--

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a palpable feeling when
all of that psionic energy

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:90%
is moving.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:90%
You can really feel it.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:90%
It feels like dry water.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We had ones that would
go halfway around the neck

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.945 align:middle line:84%
and around the spine, around
the base of the skull.

00:16:50.945 --> 00:16:51.745 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yep.

00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the
thought transmission

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:90%
to even stop a heart.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Toward, like you said,
to make that person

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:90%
feel very uncomfortable.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Or give yourself maybe
five or 10 seconds

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.240 align:middle line:90%
to discombobulate them mentally.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.194 align:middle line:84%
So you could make the move
to get whatever you needed.

00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.665 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of the
halo-based, or whether you

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:84%
go on the head around the neck
or on the back of the neck

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
are going directly

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.590 align:middle line:90%
through the brain.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.848 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So you're amplifying
everything out of the brain.

00:17:24.848 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:84%
TK amplifiers are
specifically amplifying

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
the energy coming
out of the body,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:90%
directed through the brain.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.578 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And we should
probably mention it's not only

00:17:34.578 --> 00:17:35.655 align:middle line:90%
for negative warfare.

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.385 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: These energies you
could restart a heart possibly.

00:17:38.385 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER:
(ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Yeah.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You could-- heal
someone from bleeding out

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:90%
of their brain.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah, for sure.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you could do CPR.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:90%
I could do CPR from over here.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: If you passed out.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I'd be like, no.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Start back up again.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.077 align:middle line:84%
And get you just
started from over here.

00:17:54.077 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not to mention lift
heavy things off of people

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:84%
or protect people
from falling objects.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, let's
keep in mind that there

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
is 20 defensive capabilities
for every offensive capability

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:90%
that you can think of.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
That always makes me
think about the pyramids

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and other megalithic structures
that they had made where people

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
thought they were getting
this giant granite

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.650 align:middle line:84%
slab by itself to
do it, but really

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
it possibly could have been
these types of technologies

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.953 align:middle line:90%
that they were doing it.

00:18:25.953 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And it's certainly
one of the possibilities that

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:90%
could check off on that.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is
the end goal if they're

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:90%
successful on the Axis side?

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: If anyone were to
note in their history books

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
what past agendas looked
like and who was favored

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and who was disfavored, I
would suggest that there would

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.043 align:middle line:90%
be lots more of that and worse.

00:18:57.043 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it's just
escalating from the negativity

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
of our past history where
that would come to fruition.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.838 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say ethnic--

00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Without pointing
fingers or names.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.588 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Let's just say
ethnic-racial conflict

00:19:08.588 --> 00:19:11.412 align:middle line:90%
would reach an intense level.

00:19:11.412 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, vice-versa,
Randy, how would that

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.562 align:middle line:90%
benefit us on the Allied side?

00:19:15.562 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, well, then
it goes the other way.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.895 align:middle line:84%
So then we get to
live in a world

00:19:18.895 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
where we actually get to
treat everybody like--

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:90%
we all get to be equals.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does this psionic
energy and warfare--

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
everything we talked
about on both sides

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
affect the planet's
energetic system in any way?

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Effect?

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I would say, though, that
the planet's own energy

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:84%
system is strong enough
to not be hurt by this.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I think a fair way to say this
is as far as the planet is

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
concerned, if we don't sort
out what's happening up here

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.775 align:middle line:84%
on the surface, we're
going to get brushed off.

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fasted off, right?

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.937 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: She's going to
start over and try again.

00:19:57.937 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That makes sense.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's what nature does.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: She's done it before.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Many times.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
that Mom doesn't care.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that the
planet doesn't care about us.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But we have to also
demonstrate that we

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.230 align:middle line:84%
care enough about the
planet and ourselves

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to not destroy what
we've been gifted here.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have an
opportunity to make it work

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:90%
and to not get brushed off.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of that is up to
us as a collective species

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and what we really feel like
we're willing to do about it

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and sacrifices we might
be willing to make or not.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.845 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can we do to
prevent this from happening?

00:20:36.845 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: One of the things
that we teach at our school--

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
the University of
Conscious Evolution

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the personal state that
a person can be in consciously

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
not only impacts the
reality in which they exist,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
it impacts the larger reality
in which we all exist.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And there is a way in
which each individual can

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
do the best within themselves to
be grounded, centered, focused,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:90%
shielded.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So that other people
can be more grounded,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:90%
centered, focused, and shielded.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:14.630 align:middle line:84%
If you panic, you're going
to create more panic.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:84%
If you get centered
and calm and grounded,

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create more
calm grounded centeredness

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
we think individuals

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
got to do what
individuals got to do.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And the more individuals who
can be grounded and centered,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
the more that will help
the people around them.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:84%
The more those people
panic, the more

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that is just going to contribute
to more panic around them.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we think
some amount of accountability

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and responsibility
in what can we

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
do with our own
minds, our own bodies,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and our own emotional states
to stay grounded, centered,

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and focused.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.317 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the Earth
Defense Force that you're

00:21:55.317 --> 00:21:56.630 align:middle line:90%
involved with doing about this?

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Fighting every day.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are
psionic battle combat

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:90%
operations happening every day.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they are
attacking, defending,

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.942 align:middle line:84%
running intelligence operations
to fight a psionic war.

00:22:11.942 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how are we
coming along with that?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Winning.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Excellent.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
It's good news.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how will they
determine that we are winning?

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The same way that
one normally determines

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:90%
that one is winning in battle.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You give out more
licks than you take.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So right now we're
delivering more hard punches

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.657 align:middle line:84%
than we're taking, and so
therefore we're winning.

00:22:34.657 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
extraterrestrial forces working

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:90%
with us for that purpose?

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Certainly.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our allies are
always trying to help,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.858 align:middle line:84%
and enemies are always
trying to enemy.

00:22:44.858 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
a limit to how much

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:90%
they can help on both sides?

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.295 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, but it's--

00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With the
treaties and whatnot?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.535 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's
boundaries, right?

00:22:54.535 --> 00:22:55.335 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And more so than
it being about strict rules,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
it's about guidelines that
are there for a reason.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And do you have to be in
the lines all the time

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:84%
or can you be just
outside the lines to

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
make sure that
something gets done?

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So the guideline is
say, between here

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and here, but maybe
you do something that's

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.172 align:middle line:90%
just slightly over here--

00:23:21.172 --> 00:23:22.588 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Just a
little bit, right.

00:23:22.588 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: That's not out here.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Outside the guidelines,
it's just over here.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So guidelines are trying to
be followed and enforced,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.740 align:middle line:90%
but not religiously.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say that.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
There can be some
wiggle room there.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are human
psionic abilities

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
different or similar to
extraterrestrial psionic

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:90%
abilities?

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The general abilities
themselves are the same.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We were born with it?

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:90%
We're born with them.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And psionics isn't
really about a skill set.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's more about
physics of what can you

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:84%
do to bend matter and
energy around you.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And how does your creative
part of your brain

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:90%
understand the physics of that?

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
options come out of.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So whether a species we
or someone else comes up

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:84%
with a specific tactic or
option is a combination

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the
principles and the physics,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and having enough of
creativity to come up

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.167 align:middle line:90%
with something new and fresh.

00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there's definitely
some additional training

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
for most of us that
would be needed to--

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.935 align:middle line:84%
let's just say, get
better psionic abilities.

00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, military personnel,
psionic specialists,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:84%
it's like an 18-month
training program.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's every
day for 18 months,

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
all day long, practicing
focused meditation,

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.300 align:middle line:90%
psionic development.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And then from
there on after forever?

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they have training
sessions every day.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They are working every
day forever after that.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So they don't get days
off or they're like,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking a day off
from my psionics today.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't happen.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So they continue to get
better and better and better.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Civilians just have to cut
out some time in their lives

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and carve it out every day
and make some time every day,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
if you want any
kind of development

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.123 align:middle line:84%
that could be achieved by real,
real progress and development.

00:25:22.123 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing it once a
week, you're not doing it.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing it twice a
week, you're still not doing it.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying a person
will get zero benefit

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:84%
from meditating or doing
a practice once a week

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:90%
or twice a week.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying you will not make
real developmental progress

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:84%
unless you're doing
it every day period.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Period.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the secret.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:84%
The secret is do your practice
and your disciplines every day,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:90%
and you will make progress.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why psionics Randy,
and not other conventional ways

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:90%
of warfare?

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think the
most important thing there

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:90%
is psionics are in your brain.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
If you forget your rifle
or you run out of ammo,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:90%
you're in trouble.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
If your ammunition
is mental waves,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
then you've got ammo
until you're fatigued,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:84%
which is not the same thing
as running out of bullets

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
so there are many
advantages, many advantages

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to psionic combat
with someone who

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:84%
has the level of development
necessary for that

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:90%
to be effective.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But it can be
incredibly effective--

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you say the
warfare is within the soldier

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:90%
The best soldiers with--

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You know
what I mean by that?

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:31.805 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I do.

00:26:31.805 --> 00:26:32.605 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:26:32.605 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And the person
with the greatest ability

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to have field-capable psionic
abilities doesn't need a rifle.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nope.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Doesn't need one.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Not at all.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Will
brain implants that

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
have been talked about recently
help enhance psionic abilities?

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: They can.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a funny thing
about hardware

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
adding hardware

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to the brain and the body
to amplify its own work.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.860 align:middle line:84%
There's some good
technology there

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and there's some really
crappy technology there.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.487 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't just want
anything put into my body that

00:27:08.487 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to help that.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd want to be really
picky about it.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But there are certainly some
cybernetic tools and amplifiers

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:90%
that can enhance the process.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Definitely, definitely.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I think what we have is sort
of military-level technology,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Civilian-level
technology.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Civilian-level technology is
nowhere close at this point.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think I heard
the Neurolink studies,

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
a whole bunch of chimpanzees
died from the procedure.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:90%
So they're not--

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
From what I've heard we
really haven't perfected that.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.835 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, no, no.

00:27:40.835 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely not.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.285 align:middle line:90%
Definitely not.

00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's a little scary.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For our
viewers, Randy, maybe

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
you could inform them
ways to protect themselves

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:90%
from psionic.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The most
important basic thing

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:84%
for people to have is some
form of psionic self-defense.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And that really
means having a field

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in which you are putting time,
energy, and development into.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Think of that field
around you as something

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that is as thin as paper
when you start out.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But every day, it gets
thicker and thicker.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you stack 20
sheets of paper together,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:90%
it will stop a bullet, right?

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So one sheet of paper
thin, 20 sheets of paper

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:84%
like a piece of wood that
bullets can't go through.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think
about the development

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
of psionic shielding as
something that starts out

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:90%
very thin and very weak.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But that over time
becomes stronger

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and stronger and stronger.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So that it starts to
keep out thoughts,

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:84%
emotions, energies,
directed energy weapons,

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and can even bend physical
objects around that field

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't come
into contact with you.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So it is really
just about, again,

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.240 align:middle line:84%
a diligent daily
practice of focusing on

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
one's psionic energy
fields in such a way as

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to bolster that defense
every day every day,

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:84%
every day, every day,
to keep that stuff out.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:84%
If we were born on a planet
in which we were taught this

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.190 align:middle line:84%
from the time that
we were young,

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:19.890 align:middle line:84%
it would be habit by
the time we were 12.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But since we're
not, for those of us

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.310 align:middle line:84%
who are starting later in life,
you just got to start somewhere

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and you start at square one.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And so square one is
not very impressive,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:84%
but you start at square
one, and by the time

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
you get to square 50, you've
got something that works.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Randy,
thank you so much.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
great information

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:90%
to share with our viewers.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for
being on the show.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.997 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: My pleasure.

00:29:43.997 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
