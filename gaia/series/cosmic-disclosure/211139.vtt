00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Randy Cramer,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:10%
who has participated in a covert
military space program for 18

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
years called the
Earth Defense Force.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking
about how to know if you've

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:90%
been in a secret space program.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me, Emery.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Before exploring how we
can find out if someone was

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:84%
in a covert space program,
what is the "secret"

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.187 align:middle line:90%
in "secret space program"?

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Mostly, it has to do with the
level of compartmentalization

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and secrecy about how the
personnel are acquired,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:84%
trained, and deployed, which is
so covert that most individuals

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:84%
return from a tour of service
without even remembering full

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
recollection of what
they experienced.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
It's so secret that
more often than not,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
the soldiers and personnel
themselves, when they return

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.993 align:middle line:90%
from duty, don't remember.

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
That's how secret it is,
that they're not even

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:84%
supposed to remember where
they were and what they did.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of people
watching that suspect they were

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:84%
in a covert, secret
space program,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and why wouldn't they know
they were in a covert,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:90%
secret space program?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the, quote,
unquote, "memory wipe"

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:84%
which I have talked
about before,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
which is not so much a
memory wipe as it is a memory

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:90%
suppression.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of
the brain as a bowl

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and you think of the contents
of the brain, of your mind,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
as a fluid or liquid within
the bowl, water or whatever,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
that's all your thoughts, all
your memories, and everything.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
The memories associated
with a covert tour of duty

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
would be like a balloon
filled with water,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and then put a cork in
it so that it's separate,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
contained, but within
the wholeness of the mind

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and the brain itself,
so that the person

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
in their regular
daytime thinking

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.789 align:middle line:84%
is floating around
in the thoughts that

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
are in the open bowl, but the
compartmentalized portion,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
if they can't get through
that cork, which is usually

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
through technological,
cryptographical code words

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and things that can access
back and forth into that memory

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
compartment, most of
the time-- otherwise,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
the memory is completely
corked off, contained,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and separate from their
normal day-to-day experiences.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So most people
just don't remember

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
what's in there, again, because
it's self-contained here,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
so what's happening
here is separate.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
What happens is some of
this memory over here

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
starts to seep out,
starts to bleed out

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, and so
flashes of things,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.328 align:middle line:84%
random unaccounted-for
traumas or reactions.

00:02:53.328 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What may trigger that?

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.615 align:middle line:90%
What causes that, Randy?

00:02:55.615 --> 00:02:56.552 align:middle line:90%
>> What causes the--

00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The leak-out of
that memory, let's say.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, scientifically, we
understand that it's probably

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of
natural causes, that the--

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
if we were to think of, again,
this, your brain and your mind

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:84%
here, if the mind has a
kind of a will of its own--

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
which it does, and we'll
call it the subconscious

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:84%
for this conversation-- the
mind, your subconscious,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
has a sense of the
wholeness here,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and it has a sense
that something

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:90%
is separate from the whole.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And so your
subconscious is going

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to want to return what is
separate back into the whole,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to want
to pull some of that

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
out so that it can get access
to it and pull the cork out.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Most people, the subconscious
has a drive towards wholeness.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't like
feeling separate.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't like feeling
divided amongst itself,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and it wants to
return to wholeness.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
There does also seem to be a
time factor, as if you were

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
to set a timer when you
create this compartment,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and there are so many decades
later when it just starts--

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
that cork starts to
come apart, or it's

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:84%
going to naturally start to
pop out because of something

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:90%
that has to do with time.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Over time, a certain
number of decades,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.310 align:middle line:84%
20, 30 years in some cases,
when people start to--

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
this compartment, the
cork starts to move,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:90%
or it starts to seep out.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And they start having
really intense emotional,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.235 align:middle line:84%
psychological, or
physical experiences.

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, are there any common
childhood memories one would

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
have?

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll say that there's sort
of a Venn diagram of some

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:84%
different experiences that
not every person will have,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
but that if a person has one
or more of those experiences,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
it starts to check
boxes on that, you know,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
you're pointing in a direction
that they may have been

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:90%
in a program.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So most common things
are dreams, recollections

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:84%
or memories, and any
type of experience

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't seem linear,
meaning you can't just

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
place it back-- oh, this
happened exactly when I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
was this years old, and it
happened this linear way.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:90%
They kind of just pop in.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when something just
pops in and it's not linear--

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and there's usually
an association

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
with military activity,
military structure,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.235 align:middle line:90%
military organization.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
With someone who's never
been in the military

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
describes to me an
experience of being a child

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and being mustered--
which, anyone who's

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
been in the military knows,
when you muster troops,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.252 align:middle line:84%
you're organizing them
and pulling them together,

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:31.752 align:middle line:84%
there's a certain
protocol for that.

00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's never
been in the military

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
would have no idea why
or how that would happen,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have any idea
why they would remember it

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
from an eight-year-old
brain or recollection.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not, when people

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
come to me, that's a very
common thing, to say,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
well, I remember
something weird.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, it seemed
like they were organizing us

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.662 align:middle line:84%
together and
putting us in a line

00:05:52.662 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and walking us from
one place to another.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, you got mustered
and walked from point A

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:90%
to point B.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
That's a check that
makes a question mark,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and I won't give someone a
thumbs-up or a thumbs-down

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
until I've had a chance to fully
assess what they do remember,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
what they know about their
childhood, their childhood

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
experiences, parents, parents'
jobs, parents' careers that

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
can sometimes come into
play there, and make

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:90%
an assessment of that.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.798 align:middle line:84%
But there's more than, you know,
a handful of things that have

00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
to appear on that
list, but that'll--

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And what techniques are
you're using to extract this

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.427 align:middle line:90%
information from--

00:06:28.427 --> 00:06:31.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Mostly just
conversational interview.

00:06:31.435 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just, I know
what I'm looking for,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle line:84%
so I start asking
questions that are

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
going to get me the answers
of what I'm looking for or not

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:90%
what I'm looking for.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.077 align:middle line:84%
And things that aren't
what I'm looking for

00:06:42.077 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
will go into this
category, and things

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that are what I'm looking
for will check boxes.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And once I check
enough boxes, then we

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.845 align:middle line:90%
move on to another step.

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there are people that
have been subject to mil-lab

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
programming that think they
may have been part of a covert

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:84%
secret space program
but they have not.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.636 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately, there is a
real messy area here that--

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
again, another Venn
diagram of things

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
crossing over with
one another, where

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
you have a legitimate
experience,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
you have brain injury
or psychological trauma,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and you have mental
health conditions.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
This is not to say that a
person having legit experiences

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is crazy or has a head
injury, but it's also possible

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
that a person may
have one or more

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of all of these things
happening at once.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible for someone
to have anxiety, depression,

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and some other mental
health symptoms,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
have also some experiences
of a legitimate experience,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and also have symptoms or
signs of a head injury or brain

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
trauma, in which case, then,
you're trying to decode

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:84%
or decipher what to do
with all of those things.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And the sad truth is I call
this place where all of this

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.990 align:middle line:84%
comes together in this Venn
diagram "brain oatmeal,"

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately, there
are a lot of people who,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
the process is really
hard on the psyche,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
on the emotional body,
and on the physical body,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:90%
on the neurons.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a number of people that
come out of these experiences

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.137 align:middle line:84%
with what a doctor might call
a minor traumatic brain injury,

00:08:17.137 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
but if you were probably
to do a SPECT scan,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.913 align:middle line:84%
you'd probably find lumps and
holes and things that are--

00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:24.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Physical brain damage.

00:08:24.955 --> 00:08:25.225 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:27.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, indicative of some
real physical brain damage.

00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I know several people,
including myself,

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that have had to actually
heal that brain damage

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and recover neurological brain
activity because of that.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
And so we know how to walk
people through the process.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:90%
We know how to go through steps.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:10%
It's never a guarantee because
the person has to be really

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:10%
fully engaged in the process,
and unfortunately that "brain

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:10%
oatmeal" part means that
some people we can work with,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:10%
and some people we
can really help.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.288 align:middle line:84%
And some people, it's
not a matter of, again,

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to say, I'm
sorry, I don't think you

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.247 align:middle line:90%
had a legitimate experience.

00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:01.435 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, you may have.

00:09:01.435 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
You check a certain
number of boxes over here

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:84%
on legitimate
experience, but I'm also

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
seeing tremendous
amount of anxiety,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
tremendous amount of
depression, chronic maybe,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:90%
or even paranoia.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:90%
That's hard to work with.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
having more conversation,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're finding gaps in logic
or pathing or problem solving

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that become indicative
of a brain injury.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things can
be possible at the same time

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
when you're dealing with
someone who's been post-program,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:84%
so it's tricky to
assess all of that

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and then do what
best I can, we can,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
to direct them to
someone more professional

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
if it looks like they
need medical attention

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and they need to get
something looked at.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I actually have a
student who was an Iraqi vet

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and had an IED go
off next to him

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and got a severe traumatic
brain injury from it.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
He's recovered himself almost,
like, a hundred percent.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he couldn't talk
right and couldn't hardly

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:90%
motor-skill right.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They put him back
on the job, and he

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
was dedicated to
repairing serious brain

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:90%
damage from an explosion.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So I want to point out,
first and foremost,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
don't listen to anybody
in medical science

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
tell you that you
can't fix brain damage

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
or you can't fix damaged
brain tissue, because you can.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a tremendous
amount of time, energy, focus,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.368 align:middle line:90%
and work.

00:10:25.368 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> How about the people out
there that do get triggered

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:84%
by watching a space
program or movie or a show,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that they start to believe that
they possibly may have been

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.305 align:middle line:90%
part of a covert space program?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That's something, again,
that, you know, 20 questions,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to suss that out by
question five, OK, for sure.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it happens,
and it's rampant.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
I don't know what

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the answer to the cure of our
social narcissistic personality

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
disorder problems are,
but yeah, it's a mess.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.962 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of them, and I think

00:11:01.962 --> 00:11:03.045 align:middle line:90%
they should all be vetted.

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.255 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:03.255 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they should all
have to take polygraphs.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I think they should all be
willing to be scrutinized,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.582 align:middle line:84%
because I think, in many cases,
it's just patently ridiculous.

00:11:11.582 --> 00:11:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that
may be the pot calling

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.582 align:middle line:84%
the kettle black in some
cases, in some people's minds,

00:11:15.582 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:90%
but for someone--

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe this show brings
that out in people as well.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well, again--

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they hear
your story or my story,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.775 align:middle line:84%
they go out and they
start researching,

00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
thing you know,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
they have recall of some
sort that they believe.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.125 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and like I
said, if I were,

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and my partner, if we
were discerning a subject

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to determine what to do
for them and with them

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and guide them
through the process,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
sussing out whether
someone's just not worth

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
my time, her time, or
our time, and you know,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
might suggest they go talk
to somebody else or something

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.922 align:middle line:90%
and, you know--

00:11:51.922 --> 00:11:54.505 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the audience, I think
they should know this happens

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot more often, I think,
not speaking for yourself,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
but even myself and Gaia
TV, where they do their due

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
diligence in looking
for people like that.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I mean, it does.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It certainly is a--
it's a difficult thing.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, I go through
the screening process

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:90%
with everybody.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.975 align:middle line:84%
That's the best I
can do at this point.

00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people who watch
this show who, all of a sudden,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:84%
they have-- they believe
and think they have a memory

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:90%
of something similar.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.967 align:middle line:84%
So how do we discern
that from the reality?

00:12:24.967 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, there's a list, and
someone comes to me and says,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I have this one thing, I
go, OK, that's one thing.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
ask a bunch of questions,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and if they have a
legitimate experience

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
with legitimate memories and
a psychological, emotional

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:84%
pattern that matches a
legitimate experience,

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to pick that out
in a five-minute conversation.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting pretty
good at this, so

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't take very
long for me to suss out

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:90%
where someone is on that chart.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So if-- within 20
questions, again,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
really clear that, OK,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
this person has one thing that
they think they have a memory

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.222 align:middle line:84%
of or maybe have a memory
of, nothing else, right,

00:13:07.222 --> 00:13:08.555 align:middle line:90%
is basically what I'm going to--

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:10.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, right, like what if
they only have a few memories

00:13:10.972 --> 00:13:13.265 align:middle line:84%
and don't complete
the entire story?

00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I would basically direct that
person to some self-awareness

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and some self-discovery and
see what they come up with.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, someone's
kind of on their journey,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
but if they start pulling
up stuff that seems,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
again, legitimate, I'll be
like, OK, let's work with that.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible, Randy,
that the more people that come

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
forward, like yourself, that
this creates a, let's just say,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
an energy entity in the
morphogenic field which others

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.725 align:middle line:84%
maybe pick up and
get downloaded?

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's also
possible in some cases.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who come to me,
I would say the vast majority

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:84%
are incredibly
skeptical of what's

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
happening, of what their own
experiences are occurring.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.095 align:middle line:84%
So, usually, the
first thing is, I

00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's
happening here,

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I might be losing my
mind or something,

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:90%
er, I got some questions.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So a healthy
skepticism is a sign

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of a healthy mind in this
situation, so someone who's

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
a little too ready to embrace
this much information--

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, got it.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --too ready to run
with it without more--

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
confirming their own data
and doing their own deep work

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
into their own
mind-- because you

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.323 align:middle line:84%
have to have an understanding
of the relationship

00:14:28.323 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:84%
with your conscious and
your subconscious mind

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
get at these memories

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that I'm describing,
like in this bowl, right?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.925 align:middle line:84%
There's no other way
to do that than--

00:14:36.925 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
couple things that we

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:43.523 align:middle line:84%
can do to prod the brain,
but the individual themselves

00:14:43.523 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
has to get out the
pickax and the shovel

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.715 align:middle line:90%
and start doing the work--

00:14:46.715 --> 00:14:46.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:46.913 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> --as they're digging away.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to that, is
there any specific way to test

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.904 align:middle line:84%
if the individual-- you know,
if you could verify that they

00:14:54.904 --> 00:14:55.862 align:middle line:90%
actually were enlisted?

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:56.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:56.662 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I can run name, date, date
of birth through a database,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.845 align:middle line:84%
and we can find out all kinds
of stuff from the database.

00:15:03.845 --> 00:15:04.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:15:04.645 --> 00:15:05.575 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty recent.

00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:06.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's really great.

00:15:06.325 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>> That's within the
last couple of years,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.808 align:middle line:84%
that that database has come
together and that we have

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:10.765 align:middle line:90%
access to that, so--

00:15:10.765 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> How would someone on their
own be able to go through this

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.944 align:middle line:90%
verification process?

00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:16.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Complete and total guesswork.

00:15:16.277 --> 00:15:17.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:17.117 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're not a
professional in this field--

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
which, at this point, I'm
probably the most qualified

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:84%
professional in this
field just by having

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
to be a person who has had
to do it myself and walk lots

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:90%
of people through the process.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not a
professional in the field

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and you don't understand this
fully, then you're guessing,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and so I encourage
people not to guess.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people
to want to get

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.625 align:middle line:90%
to the truth and the facts--

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:43.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:46.642 align:middle line:84%
>> --so that they can
be an appropriate actor

00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
in their lives,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
because it may or may not
be what they think it is.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.507 align:middle line:84%
And it may or may not be--
you know, may have to-- they

00:15:53.507 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
think, oh, maybe I
have to go do this.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
No, maybe it's really over here,
and you want to go do this.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.181 align:middle line:84%
But getting clarity and truth
is the most important thing.

00:16:01.181 --> 00:16:01.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:16:01.981 --> 00:16:03.314 align:middle line:90%
And what would you tell someone?

00:16:03.314 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
What would they do
after they verify

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.475 align:middle line:90%
they were in the program?

00:16:06.475 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> At that point, it's teaching
basic psionic self-defense,

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
basic meditative skills, same--
all the stuff that we teach

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Conscious Evolution,

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:84%
so that people can
then center themselves,

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.777 align:middle line:84%
get their own memories back, and
work on psionic self-defense,

00:16:20.777 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
because I guarantee one of
the first things that's going

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
to happen when someone starts to
dig into their own memory core

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.527 align:middle line:84%
is there will--
attacks will come.

00:16:28.527 --> 00:16:29.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:29.327 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Tripwires will happen, and
so without solid grounding,

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:84%
centering, anchoring,
psionic self-defense,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:84%
you're just asking
to be a punching bag.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's, again,
protocols that we

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
teach people to make this as
least difficult, least horrible

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.117 align:middle line:90%
of a process as possible.

00:16:46.117 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to make
it pleasant and nice.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.913 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to be honest,
there's no way to do that.

00:16:49.913 --> 00:16:50.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:16:50.205 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But there is ways
to make it not suck,

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's really the goal here,
is to help people make it not

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:90%
suck.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That brings me to--

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I hear a lot of people--

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I just want to say this.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people who
come to me or who I talk about,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:90%
and they are struggling so hard.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.242 align:middle line:84%
And they can't get out of the
part where it's just miserable

00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and it sucks all
the time for them,

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
so I just want everybody
to know, I feel your pain.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.307 align:middle line:84%
We've been there,
and we just want

00:17:14.307 --> 00:17:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to help people walk through
the process, really.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, some individuals say
they have been, you know,

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:84%
mind-wiped of all
this information,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
of their memories of this,
and it slowly trickles back.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.457 align:middle line:84%
Well, why in the first place
do they have to mind-wipe them?

00:17:28.457 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that they have to.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a--

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it a protection thing?

00:17:32.837 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a choice
based on, you know,

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.067 align:middle line:84%
keeping things and
information secure.

00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:38.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:38.867 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:10%
>> So if your goal is to keep
a vast amount of information

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:10%
completely secure, and you've
set up a barrier so that

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:10%
the personnel who have the
experiences of that information

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.860 align:middle line:10%
themselves don't recall it,
anything less than that is

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:10%
going to feel less secure.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:10%
So we're really trying to
motivate people internally

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:10%
to get away from this because
the damage of what we have

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:10%
to keep repairing and
picking up from people

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:10%
is really unnecessary,
in my opinion.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the personnel who
make that secrecy a priority,

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:84%
it's important to them enough
to do it and ruin people's lives

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And we think that it's
more important to not

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
ruin people's lives,
and there's better ways

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:90%
to keep that information secure.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So how does it work
when they've already been

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
mind-wiped, but yet, now they're
going on another mission?

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, it's
not a mind-wipe.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.338 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
either a suppression

00:18:39.338 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
or a compartmentalization,
so again--

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that open up again for
them to realize what they went

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.105 align:middle line:90%
through?

00:18:44.105 --> 00:18:45.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me try and describe that.

00:18:45.438 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have the
bowl of your brain.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The water, the fluid,
that's your mind,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and a balloon with
a cork in it, that's

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
the compartmentalized
knowledge and information.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So instead of the
cork coming out,

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:84%
what happens is, when
the person is redeployed,

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
it's more like hooking
two jumper cables up

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to the compartment
and connecting it

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
straight to the frontal lobe so
that it doesn't have to connect

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the mind.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It just jumps straight into
the front of the brain,

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and then with a mere
flip of a switch,

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
it's frontal lobe-connect
or frontal lobe-disconnect

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.397 align:middle line:90%
from that compartment.

00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So I get letters.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:90%
You get letters, emails.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:84%
People are wondering how
they can join a covert space

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.785 align:middle line:84%
>> The selection process is
not on a volunteer basis.

00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> How do they select?

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a long list of
criteria which can be used

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:90%
to select.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Almost certainly,
at the top of that

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
list will be some understanding
of the person's genetic coding

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or their history
of family genetics

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:90%
that would incline them to be--

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
have certain
propensities genetically

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
or be able to have genetic
augmentation or gene

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
therapy that would enhance
those genes to make them

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:90%
field operable, preferable.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's not always that.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes-- it's not
always from birth.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not always from families.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.097 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
when they're kids.

00:20:12.097 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's testing when
they're in elementary school

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:90%
or kindergarten.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Some say their parents were
military or with government

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
agencies, and is this
something you see in common?

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, also if the person in
question has family members who

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
are military
intelligence branch.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
There was certainly
a time period,

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
especially in the '60s,
if someone had parents

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:84%
who were in the military,
in an intelligence program,

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:84%
those people were encouraged
to bring their kids

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:90%
in for testing.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So that was a dense period
of, if you had family,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.640 align:middle line:84%
then there was a really
good chance that someone

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
was bringing you in for
testing at some point.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you pass
enough tests, then you

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
move on to something
else, into a program.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
the new Space Force.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in joining a space
force or a space program,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.802 align:middle line:84%
does that give you
better access to the SSP?

00:21:06.802 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I don't know
about whether Space--

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.968 align:middle line:90%
what's true with Space Force.

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I guess if there was a
department that would probably

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.157 align:middle line:84%
have the quickest
access, I would

00:21:14.157 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:84%
say that someone would want to
find their way into Naval Space

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Command.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:90%
That would probably be--

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I believe that, too.

00:21:19.275 --> 00:21:21.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, probably, but
good luck with that, too.

00:21:21.307 --> 00:21:22.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:22.107 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That's not super
easy-peasy either,

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:90%
but that would be my suggestion.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.290 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.725 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to nitpick
or pick on Space Force.

00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:29.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, you don't want to--

00:21:29.933 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But they're new, so until
they're not new anymore,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to make fun.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But they've got a
long ways to come

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.935 align:middle line:90%
before I feel like they're a--

00:21:38.935 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they're new.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.732 align:middle line:84%
Like, we both know they're new
because that's the title that's

00:21:42.732 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
out there, but it's
kind of already

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.197 align:middle line:84%
been there for quite a long
time under different-- you know.

00:21:47.197 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I haven't
heard what everyone's trying

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to lateral in and bring
under the umbrella.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.328 align:middle line:84%
I've been hearing that there's
been some arguments about that,

00:21:55.328 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and some people are saying we're
supposed to bring everything

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
into this umbrella.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.235 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people saying,

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
F you, we're not coming
under your umbrella.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.897 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've
heard, so I don't know.

00:22:03.897 --> 00:22:05.355 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've heard
different, but--

00:22:05.355 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do have a lot of
people out there claiming,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that are non-military, that
they were part of the SSP,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.495 align:middle line:84%
compared to the-- of the
military that do claim that

00:22:13.495 --> 00:22:14.295 align:middle line:90%
they were.

00:22:14.295 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.525 align:middle line:84%
Most military personnel
would know to shut up--

00:22:16.525 --> 00:22:17.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:17.325 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, and would just be
conditioned and trained to shut

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.632 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to do this.

00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I was conditioned and
trained to shut up,

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:90%
and I had to be convinced.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So people, I think, who
are military trained

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
are trained to button it up,
and loose lips sink ships.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So why do these people that
are non-military claiming to be

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
with the SSP be chosen for it,
number one, and number two,

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
have these memories and come
forward without keeping it

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.380 align:middle line:90%
classified?

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the number one reason
is really personnel shortfalls.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So the covert military space
programs, across the board,

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough
boots to fill--

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
enough people to fill
boots to do jobs.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So they are always looking
at personnel shortfalls.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So where they are
recruiting from,

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:09.366 align:middle line:84%
drawing from, in some cases,
is not from, you know,

00:23:09.366 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:84%
disciplined, organized,
trained ranks.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
In many cases,
they're people who

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
are being brought in almost
as civilian-- the equivalent

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:84%
of civilian contractors
to do a task or a job

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
because they've got a propensity
to do one thing or maybe

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:90%
two things.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And so at that
point, that person

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is just a cog that someone
said, you'll fit nicely here,

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and stuck them there
because they needed a cog

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.770 align:middle line:90%
to go in that spot.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And why keep them around?

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't they be
just so expendable

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that we'll just find
another Randy Cramer

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.052 align:middle line:90%
or clone that person?

00:23:45.052 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there
are people watching,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:84%
our neighbors from out of town,
who are watching how we conduct

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:58.400 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, and if we just went
around vaporizing our personnel

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:90%
when they were retired--

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Randy just had a
heart attack last night for no

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:90%
reason.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --it would reflect badly
on the way that we treat

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:90%
our veterans.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So we can't just vaporize
people once that they're done.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
rules on how we're

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be treating
those personnel,

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
how we're supposed to be getting
them back into civilian life,

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and how we're supposed to be
taking care of their health

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:90%
care and so forth.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.977 align:middle line:84%
These are things
that are treaty--

00:24:21.977 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
locked into treaties,
and we're not

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.310 align:middle line:90%
doing a hundred percent of that.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.365 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of, any of
these veteran SSP people that

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
you've mentioned, is there an
organization that they belong

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:90%
to that you guys meet up or--

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:84%
No, everyone's just kind of
winging it at the moment,

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:84%
trying to sort out, through
their chain of command,

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:84%
what options they have
and what they can do,

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's different
for every person

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:90%
to try and sort that out.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I know a number
of different people

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that have had a very
successful process with that

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and some people who
have had an incredibly

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:90%
unsuccessful process with that.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:90%
So it can go either way.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Why doesn't a covert space
program recruit from within

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.180 align:middle line:90%
their own ranks?

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, they certainly
do, but again,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:90%
it's personnel shortfalls.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:84%
They just need way more
bodies in boots and jobs

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:90%
than they have.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
looking elsewhere,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
looking to corporate
contractors,

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.010 align:middle line:84%
looking to other personnel
agencies that will find you

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.545 align:middle line:90%
those personnel that you need.

00:25:25.545 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, you send
them a list, I

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
need a hundred of
these people that

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
have these characteristics,
can do these jobs,

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and another agency
will go, all right,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll go find a
hundred people that

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
match these qualities
and characteristics

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and bring them to you.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.265 align:middle line:84%
>> How are those people
approached, then?

00:25:39.265 --> 00:25:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not
always approached.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're just taken
in the middle of the night

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and then integrated
into a program

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
without them knowing about
it, but-- or sometimes not.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they do
recruit from internal,

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:90%
in the military personnel.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
There are regular Army, regular
Marine Corps, regular Navy,

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
regular Air Force
personnel who do get moved

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:90%
into one of these programs.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
If they're excellent enough
and they're outstanding enough,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
then that can happen, or
they have a skill that's

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.955 align:middle line:90%
really specialized and needed.

00:26:07.955 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people
that I've talked to

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and who've gone from
regular military jobs

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to covert military jobs, it
was something really technical

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that they were really
good at, that there

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
was one out of a
thousand people that

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:84%
could do that job that way,
and that's why they got

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:24.625 align:middle line:90%
moved into a different position.

00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think the
numbers are out there, Randy,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of people like yourself that
are aware, not to say they all,

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of course, came to the
front with the information,

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
but that are out
there right now?

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I have to be careful.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:84%
I can't necessarily give
any kind of exact numbers,

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:47.260 align:middle line:84%
but just based on numbers of
personnel recruited and entered

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:84%
into programs per year
for the last 30 years,

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and then those people that would
exit those programs so that you

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:59.245 align:middle line:84%
would have so many veterans,
so many decades later, exiting

00:26:59.245 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:90%
those programs every year--

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> With recall, mm-hmm.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.355 align:middle line:84%
Well, with-- not--
with or without, right?

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> How about with recall?

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with-- let's
just say, total,

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that number would be more than
a hundred thousand personnel per

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
year more than personnel per
year that would be exiting

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:84%
a tour of duty and coming
back into civilian life.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.445 align:middle line:84%
So you add up a couple of
decades of more than a hundred

00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
thousand people per year,
you're talking about more

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:90%
than millions of people.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.
