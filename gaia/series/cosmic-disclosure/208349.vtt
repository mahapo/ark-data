00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor from Germany
who analyzes and suggests

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:10%
various strategies in relation
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Richard Doty,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:10%
a retired
counterintelligence agent

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to be
talking about portals and time.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get a US
perspective from you, Rick,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and from you, Tim, of
course, a German perspective.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So Rick, you've seen
so many documents

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:90%
about this type of subject.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:90%
What could you start off with?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Well, during
my counterintelligence career,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I was assigned to Area 51.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the operations
that I perfected

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
a counterintelligence
operation for

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
was an operation
or a project that

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
was run by the
National Laboratories

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
in investigating
how to time travel,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it was feasible,
different methods

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and different
procedures that could

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
be developed to move
from one area of time

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:90%
to another area of time.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually developed a
counterintelligence operation

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:90%
based on the project.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time when we get
these projects in that we

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
had to do a counterintelligence
operation for, you just read

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
a summary, the objectives,
but not everything.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I was so fascinated
by time travel

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that I read the
entire document, even

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:90%
the scientific portions of it.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So what we were trying to
do, what the United States

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
government was
trying to do is open

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
a portal or a tunnel
in the fabric of space

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:90%
in order to travel.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not disclosing anything
that's classified anymore.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of this has already
been written about.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Theories have been taught in
a college class at one time.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But what they were trying
to do is perfect procedures.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:90%
They used high-energy lasers.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:84%
They used magnetisms,
high-energy, large magnets

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to shoot lasers and other
things through a portal

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
or create a portal,
open up the time,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and then try to figure
out how to keep it open.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were using
different sheaths

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to put in there to
try to keep it open.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to then
maintain it with gases.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They used I know argon gas and a
number of other different types

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.980 align:middle line:84%
of gases they would send
through these portals.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:90%
And it actually worked.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:90%
They were able to open it.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
The problem was to keep it
open and to prevent any damage

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
or injuries to anything
that went through there.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
They were using cockroaches
to put through there.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
They were using
mice and rats and I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%
believe some other animals.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But nothing-- they couldn't
perfect it at that time.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But later on, they developed
different techniques

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.248 align:middle line:84%
and different methods
that were able to do that.

00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:22.415 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What year was this?

00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: This was in the
1980s, early to mid-1980s.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:84%
The project actually
started back in the '60s.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe Sandia
National Laboratories

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:90%
started the project.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
elementary stages back then.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Scientists were able to document
on paper how to do this.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But then when they were trying
to perfect it in reality, so

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
to speak, they ran into all
sorts of different obstacles,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
whether atmosphere, all sorts
of things that were preventing

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:90%
the time portal to open.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
They actually opened
some, but they

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
couldn't keep it open in
order for any at least humans

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:90%
to go through there.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they opened it, there
was a lot of different things

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
When you open a portal,
there were small explosions

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%
that are recurring.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:10%
There were distortions of
the atmosphere, distortions

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:10%
of the viewing as you
looked into the portal.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:10%
There was so much distortion.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
they determined was they

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:10%
didn't know that this portal
was going forward in time

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:10%
or back in time.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:10%
And that was a big
question on their part.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
perfect things that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
could determine this,
whether they were going

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:90%
forward or backwards in time.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, they did.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
They were able to perfect
the way to open a portal.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But the only problem
is the portals

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
were only open in the early
days for a millisecond.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And later on, they kept
them open for a few seconds.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they perfected something
called a nuclear injection

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
where they had a small, very
small nuclear detonation

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:90%
that they fired into--

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
they fired this ball
of nuclear material--

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they
did it-- into the portal,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and there would be a
small nuclear detonation.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:90%
That seemed to open it.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And as they try to put
the sheath in there--

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and the sheath was made of
some anti-magnetic material--

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
it would stay open
for a few seconds,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
and it would close and
destroy that sheath.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:84%
When I was there
in the early '90s

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and was part of that
project, they also

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.680 align:middle line:90%
were using special alignments.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
They found out that they had the
Earth and the different types

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of space alignments
because there's

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:90%
ley lines also in space.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And they still
did not perfect it

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:90%
at all where they could do it.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:90%
So how about you, Tim?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:90%
What have you heard?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And what have you
experienced and read about?

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: We know that
Germany was probably

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
be the first nation
in modern history

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that had experiments
on time travel.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows the
theoretical physics

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that time can be
approachable dimension.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
That is something Germans came
up with in the 1920s, '30s.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
They did experiments on that
I think about the 1940s.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Their approach was to
use high-voltage in order

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to melt down the
fabric of space, which

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
can be used in order to
move temporal dynamics,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
but absolutely not stable.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And it would also be pretty
toxic for everyone who stands

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:90%
around that kind of field.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty sure
that they did not

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
succeed in any way at that time
in the 1940s to make it stable.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.090 align:middle line:84%
What Richard was
talking about, people

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
have used that,
the same mechanics,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
allegedly way back
in the ancient times

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
where we find all those
ancient sites that were indeed

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:84%
aligned to the different
lines and star constellations.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And they used the natural
occurring energies in order

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:90%
to open certain gates.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So you were talking about
the '70s, '80s, I guess,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and you were talking
about the '90s.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:90%
I guess it was about the 2000--

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
2010-ish years where
the Greys decided

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
to give at least a certain
group of people on Earth

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
the ability to have a stable
and functioning technology.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure that
that is highly classified

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in terms of not everyone
having access to that.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the Greys
took that pretty seriously

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and made access to only a
very certain amount of people

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:90%
or a group of people.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And they exist.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So there are people that are
going through these portals,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and they are also in a
future version encapsulated

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:90%
in time of the Earth.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And their mission
is to have a look

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:90%
on how Earth is developing.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I know, they
are active in this time

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:90%
right now, even present.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I believe they're
picking specific organizations

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.239 align:middle line:84%
and people that are going to be
responsible for utilizing that.

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.755 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now are these portals
also in space, not just Earth?

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So one
thing I like to add

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
is that temporal dynamics is
capable of being weaponized.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So one can build a very
highly efficient weapon

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:90%
using temporal dynamics.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is the reason why

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Greys decided to give
it only to a very

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.998 align:middle line:90%
specific group of people.

00:09:05.998 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, could
you add to that?

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, one
of the things that

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
was developed during the
experiments in time travel

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
out at the Nevada
test site in Area 51

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:84%
was a peripheral part of
the time travel projects

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:84%
they developed,
they found that they

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
could develop an energy weapon,
a high-energy weapons system.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the objective.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But while they were
experimenting over these years,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
they realized that
there were some things

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that they could do to take
advantage of these portals.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
They were in a
process of developing

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.237 align:middle line:90%
when I left an energy weapon.

00:09:42.237 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was that a side--

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
was that a side effect,
this energy weapon was

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:90%
opening a portal?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Absolutely.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:90%
It was opening a portal.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And so when I left, they
were trying to perfect it.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably
over the years,

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:90%
they might have done that.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
When I worked for a private
laboratory in Texas,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
we were able to look
at some of the things

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that DARPA was doing in
that area of perfecting

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:90%
this type of energy weapon.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick,
they're experimenting

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:90%
with opening a portal.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
How do they know what's
on the other side?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, one
of the objectives

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:84%
was to determine exactly that
and how they would measure it

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:90%
or how they would see into it.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So they had subcontractors
working on that too.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so they developed some
techniques and some equipment,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.303 align:middle line:84%
which probably are
still classified.

00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
go into that part.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But they had actually
equipment, something

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:84%
similar to an oscilloscope
that was projecting.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
They could determine wave
patterns, normal Earth wave

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they opened
the fabric, there

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:84%
was a strange wave
pattern detected

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't
duplicate anywhere else

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:90%
but looking into that portal.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So when this
strange wave pattern

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:84%
appeared on their
scopes, they knew

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:90%
that they'd opened a portal.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem was
in the early stages,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
where that was going.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Was that going back in time, or
was it going forward in time?

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Now eventually, they took
this to another location

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:90%
in a mountain in California.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And they duplicated it, and they
realized that the wave patterns

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
there were different
than the wave patterns

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
in the desert of Nevada,
at the Nevada test

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
site, which was the
main location that they

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:90%
were testing this.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So now they figured,
wait a minute.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Why is the wave pattern
different there in California

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:90%
than what we had?

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And bingo.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They figured, that's
going one way because

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
of the altitude or the area
where they're doing it in,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and in Nevada, it was
going someplace else.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And when I left--

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and even when I worked for
the private laboratory,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.507 align:middle line:84%
this was being
developed rapidly.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do you think, Tim?

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So we all know that
dimensions are units or a way

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
to measure the location of
something inside of space.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So if we have three
dimensions, we can,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.710 align:middle line:84%
by using a triangular
method, we have a way

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
to figure out where in
space something is located.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So every particle in physics
has a specific location,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:90%
a specific position where it is.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with
temporal dynamics

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
as using time and temporal
factors as another dimension.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:84%
The problematic and confusing
thing is the geometric way

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
how to see temporal dynamics
because every particle

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
inside of a fourth dimension
of temporal dynamics

00:12:54.990 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is also located to different
other positions inside

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.930 align:middle line:90%
of this temporal dimension.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And that also brings
some challenges in order

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
how to manipulate time
because everything

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.060 align:middle line:84%
has an effect on the
past and the future,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:84%
so it kind of ripples
from that position.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when we're talking
only three positions or three

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, it's a pretty
hard and sanitized process

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:90%
to locate everything.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that
people had challenges

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how to use that.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And also, in order
to stabilize time,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to not interrupt
the flow of time,

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
but to have certain
impulses, certain

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
points in order to have
the correct ripples that

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
go around this position
of where it's located.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think what the
Greys did teach people

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and brought them to is the
algorithm and the way--

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
how to figure out and to
use temporal dynamics.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's your theory
on when people time travel

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and they go back--

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and I get this question a lot.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they go back
and stop Hitler, you know?

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
back to this time.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Would that create another
timeline and we still

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:90%
are on this timeline?

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Does that create a whole--

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
are there so many
multiple timelines,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
or is it really just
the same timeline?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So you can imagine
having a time string

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of everything.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
That is the most stable
time string where

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:90%
we have successful timelines.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:84%
If you do what you just
said and manipulate things

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and you have this rippling
effect around the impulse

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that you set into
temporal dynamics,

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
it could have a
disastrous outcome, which

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
means if you prevent
World War II,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Nazis wouldn't have happened,
and they will eventually

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
play a very big role in the
evolution of at least Earth

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:90%
at some time.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:90%
So they are necessary.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
The experience that the
universe has unfortunately

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
made in World War II is
something from probability

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and possibility
views is necessary

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:84%
in order to elevate
consciousness,

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:90%
to make that experience.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you take that away, the
timeline will eventually--

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:90%
it fails.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets reintegrated
into the mainstream,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and it would have
never happened.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So probabilities
and possibilities

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
will, if they are important
enough, will play out,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:84%
will play themselves out
maybe in a different way,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.612 align:middle line:84%
but the same effect and
experience will happen.

00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
please elaborate-- you

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
told me earlier the Greys
have given us this technology

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:90%
for time travel.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And are teams now
utilizing this?

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle line:90%
What are these teams doing?

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:90%
What is their agenda?

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: All right.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:10%
So the psychological
mission of the Greys

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:10%
was to show human people
the possible effects

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:10%
of their agenda and what
they did to themselves,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:10%
to the planet, of course,
because the Greys have

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:10%
the stock in humanity.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
They are depending on
humanity and their evolution

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:84%
in order to preserve the
overall evolution of everything.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think the previous ways
to communicate with people

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
in order to go to
the governments,

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
in terms of connecting to people
on the streets in some way--

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:84%
abduction phenomenon,
we're talking about that--

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I think they all were not
that successful in order

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to do a change, to
bring change to the way

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:90%
the human people were.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it also
like a reconnaissance

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:90%
to kind of see what's going on?

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
To come back and
say, hey, we might

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
need to change some things
so it doesn't go south.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, go into a negative.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Absolutely.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.194 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is
giving technology

00:17:23.194 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to a certain group of
people, and those people,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
they have built some
kind of presence

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
in a future version
of this planet.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
They are somehow
encapsulated in that time,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
so they're not
accidentally changing

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:90%
the future in some ways.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But through that, they are
reaching back to the version

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
we are here and right now so
that all the observers that

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing
that right now can

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.275 align:middle line:84%
be led into a possible
and productive way.

00:17:58.275 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, you
spoke about the Greys

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
having this technology
and giving it

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:90%
to a very select, elite few.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%
How do we trust them?

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Can we trust them
with this technology?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I think, hmm, the
Greys had their own benefit

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and agenda in mind when they
gave it to this kind of group.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure by what factors
they selected that group.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, I know
that those people

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
feel related to the human
race and to the benefit

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
are an elite group

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
of power in some ways--

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're not speaking about
elites that are right now here.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
There are some different
factors why they are selected.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Pretty intelligent
people, and they

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:90%
know about the consequences.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And their only mission
is to stabilize

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:90%
the timeline we're on here.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I do
trust these people,

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and I know they are present
here, and they're helpful.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this group of
elites part of the government;

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.865 align:middle line:90%
corporations; a faction?

00:19:10.865 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Who are they belonging to?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They are working together
with other influential groups

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, but they are
not connected to governments,

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
not connected to companies,
and even very loosely connected

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:90%
to the military.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Speaking of that,
Rick, through documentation

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff you've seen,
what was the agenda back then?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:84%
What were they trying to do
with time travel and portals?

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Was it for military use?

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Was it for scientific use?

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Was it for exploration?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Did you read anything
about the agenda?

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the primary
agenda was military.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.610 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to determine
whether they could use it

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:84%
in some sort of a weapons system
or maybe a counter insurgency,

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, or something
to scare the enemy.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things they found,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:84%
which was quite
surprising to them--

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
in particular, one of
the scientists, one

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:84%
of the chief scientists
involved in this at Sandia Labs,

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
he was worried about what
they were actually doing.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Were they actually opening
up a portal of time,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
or were they opening up
into another dimension?

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
That was something that they
were very concerned about.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that happened-- and this

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
is kind of tough to explain
and tough to talk about it.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:90%
But in one particular exercise--

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see this, but
I was told about it.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And it happened at
a Nevada test site.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And it happened-- they
always did these experiments

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
either very late at night or
very early in the morning,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:90%
sometime after midnight.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
they did was they

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
did this infusion of
a small nuclear device

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:90%
to open something.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot
of reactionary coming

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:90%
from the other side.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Things were thrown out.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
They'd never-- that had never
happened as far as I know.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of worried them.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Like, what did we just do?

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%
What did we just do to time?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:84%
They were really
concerned about what they

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:90%
were getting themselves into.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And when they shut this down--

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
they closed it down for
the evening at 2:00 or 3:00

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:90%
They were cleaning up.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
They saw these strange
figures down range.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking
distance downrange.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, miles downrange.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And they saw these
strange figures.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
One technician was
picking up some equipment

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and came back to one of
the directors and said,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:90%
who's downrange?

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:90%
There's people downrange.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.633 align:middle line:84%
There's not supposed
to be, obviously.

00:22:08.633 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It was very dangerous
to be down there.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But these things, whatever they
were, appeared for some time.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
10, 15 minutes, and
then they disappeared.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:90%
So what did they just do?

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Did they just open
up a dimension?

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the scientists was
very instrumental of trying

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
to convince the other scientists
that we didn't open up

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:90%
a time portal.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
We opened up a dimension, and
we brought something into this,

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.742 align:middle line:90%
back into this dimension.

00:22:39.742 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Now when everything was
clear-- and they always

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
waited 24 hours before they went
downrange for the radiation,

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
When they went down there,
they didn't find anything.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But they found pieces
of clay and pieces

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
of other debris that
had come back in.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know what
the analysis of that was.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It's probably still classified.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But they rounded that
all up and took it

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:90%
to a laboratory to examine it.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But that was one of the very,
very, very strange things

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.372 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I wasn't
there and witnessed it,

00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:84%
but I read about it, and I
was told about this later.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've actually
witnessed dimensions together,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
just for a moment in
time, where you're

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:90%
in two places at the same time.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And maybe Tim can explain that
because the fourth dimension,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking
about earlier,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
can overlap
dimensions sometimes.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Hmm.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
we need to clarify

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
is that we are talking about
different realities that

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
might in some way or another
share the same space.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So what Richard is talking
about-- and that can happen,

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
is that things that
are overlapping,

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
by putting enormous energy
into that, the frequencies

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
come closer together and
people and things can appear.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
We have the same effect in some
spaces and locations on Earth

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.830 align:middle line:84%
where people are
reporting to, for example,

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.235 align:middle line:90%
have seen ghosts or something.

00:24:16.235 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
the same effect.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The natural dynamics
of energy compress

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:90%
so much that things can appear.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
But also something I
would like to talk about

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is that there are
species and beings that

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:84%
have naturally, without
using technology,

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
comprehended and understood
the mechanics or the techniques

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:90%
in order to move through time.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So there are living
beings inside

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:84%
of temporal dimensions,
which is pretty interesting

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:90%
to understand that.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So as we are
thinking, theorizing

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that time, temporal time
can be a temporal dimension,

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
there are also non-terrestrial
beings that are only

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:90%
living inside of that time.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And they have understood that
every point in the universe

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
is connected, and that by
using the status of observer,

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
of being the observer, that
they can position and reposition

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.060 align:middle line:84%
themselves inside of
temporal dimensions.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So these are
the time travelers.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: No, these are beings
or life forms that live inside

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:90%
of temporal dimensions.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So as we experience
the 3D as a dimension,

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
as a space that is
livable and that

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
can be used in
order to live there,

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:90%
they also live inside of time.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:84%
In some way or
another, they also

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
create time, which also
influences the timelines we're

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:90%
experiencing here.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, was
there any concern

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
when you guys were
experimenting with opening

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.198 align:middle line:84%
these portals of anything
coming back through?

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, after the incident
where something came through

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and they saw figures downrange,
they were very, very concerned,

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:84%
number one, with, did they
just open a portal into time

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and now time travelers
are coming through?

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Or was it the dimension?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Did they tap into a
dimension, whether it

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:84%
was the fourth, fifth,
or whatever dimension?

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Or-- I didn't read this until
later on when I worked with

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:90%
a private laboratory--

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.468 align:middle line:90%
was a parallel universe.

00:26:40.468 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:84%
That was something that
was also brought up

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and a whole paper
written about that.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
But they were very, very
concerned at the time

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
after that incident that they
were going to bring something

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.335 align:middle line:90%
back, and maybe harm him.

00:26:54.335 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Open up the portal, and
somebody from the other side

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:84%
seeing that portal open
and coming through it,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.950 align:middle line:90%
trying to come through it.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Now we are with archaic--

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.810 align:middle line:84%
probably archaic
equipment on our side.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:84%
On the other side, maybe they're
1,000 years in the future.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And we try to bring them back
or they jump through or however

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:90%
that works, and we harm them.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was a main--
that was a concern.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Very much a concern.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.688 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Did it ever happen?

00:27:23.688 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: One particular
incident where

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
they found something at the
other end and I wasn't there.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew about it, but they
did find what they described

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:90%
as a very charred body.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you saw
this charred body.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Did it come through, or you
just saw it through the portal?

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, I wasn't there.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
But I read and I was told
in a classified meeting

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that, 24 hours later,
they went downrange

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.810 align:middle line:90%
when everything was safe.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:84%
They found a very charred
body, and they could never

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:90%
identify that.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.690 align:middle line:84%
They knew it wasn't
any of the workers.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was accounted for.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And they knew it wasn't anybody
from any of the other test site

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:90%
areas.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.365 align:middle line:84%
So was it somebody
they brought back?

00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the consensus
among scientists

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.240 align:middle line:84%
were they brought
something through,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:84%
or something voluntarily
tried to get through

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:90%
and was damaged by our side.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So could you
tell by the charred body

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:90%
if it was bipedal?

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Was it-- or was it
just completely--

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't tell
anything about it?

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, I never had the--

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:84%
there are some people that would
know this, other people that

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:90%
were involved in this.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But I was never involved
in the examination of it

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that,
and I never saw any--

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
other than it was a
charred body in the report.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.602 align:middle line:84%
And they believed
it was a humanoid.

00:28:51.602 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, do you have
anything to say about that?

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So one thing I
found super interesting

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:01.590 align:middle line:90%
to acknowledge is that time--

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
we are actually moving
backwards through time

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:90%
while approaching forwards.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So that describes the temporal
dynamics a little bit.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
See, if we see this table,
this is actually light

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that comes to our
perception, but it takes time

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to bring that memory
to the operating system

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:90%
that the consciousness using--

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness unit
is using in order

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:84%
to interpret the data that
is coming from this table.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So even if this is just like
a nanosecond or something,

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:84%
the image that I'm
seeing from this table

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:90%
is actually in the past.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So everything we are
experiencing right now

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:53.580 align:middle line:84%
is light that is coming
from a source very far away.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And we are moving
inside of that light,

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:90%
coming towards that source.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So we are experiencing a
very, very, very old presence

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:90%
of source.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.930 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of outdated, what
we're experiencing right now.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Still, we are moving
forward in time.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that temporal
dynamics have these two

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:84%
lines that are going
in opposite directions

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.740 align:middle line:84%
while having the observer
in the midst of it,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of it.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:84%
That is what I mean by saying
there are wrinkles around that.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So these
photons are actually

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.060 align:middle line:84%
in the past that
are coming of light.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Everything-- everything
we are observing right now,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.890 align:middle line:84%
you and me and Richard, we're
actually not here anymore.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:90%
The source is somewhere else.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very, very old
source or experience of thought

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that we are
experiencing right now.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If we are an old
projection of ourselves,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:90%
where do I exist?

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: You do not exist as
an I. So we are all source.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
We are this source that
radiates different potentials

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and probabilities from the
center of the universe, which

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.110 align:middle line:84%
is actually what people call
the zero point or something.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So it is the middle, the
center of everything.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And what we are experiencing
from that time and this version

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%
of the universe is
particularly based upon light.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
other versions

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that are based on
different other things,

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:84%
but what we are
experiencing here,

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:84%
everything radiates light,
photons, so to speak.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.910 align:middle line:90%
So the table radiates light.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:46.710 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And the bodies, the
biological bodies

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have in
this version, they

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:84%
are interpreting the data
that comes from that.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you zoom out
from that, everything--

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:90%
we're not actually here.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very old beam of
light that we are experiencing.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.660 align:middle line:90%
And there are beings that are--

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all models are wrong.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Some are useful.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine that's a
point of source somewhere.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we have this
light that radiates from that.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are at this
point as an observer

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.920 align:middle line:90%
very far away from source.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
We are actually
moving towards source,

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.260 align:middle line:84%
which makes
everything more dense

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
until we hit it and
we're unified again.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And from that point,
we have another version

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:90%
of the universe unfolding.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are beings
that are coming

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
from that out--
they use the waste

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
outside of the linear
timeline, and they go there

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and they repair
whatever is there

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:84%
because we are experiencing a
paradox of probability here,

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:90%
which needs to be decided.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And they are doing that,
coming and repairing everything

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
so that in the end,
eventually we can unify again.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.110 align:middle line:90%
We come together one more time.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we build a
new version of the universe.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Tim, do you
know of any instances

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
where beings came
through a portal?

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, all the time.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have two kinds of beings,
one that have evolved in a way

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.330 align:middle line:84%
that they acknowledge the
potential of traveling

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
through temporal dynamics
by themselves, by using

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the observer status in order to
relocate themselves somewhere.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't tend to
use portals anymore.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They use the natural
abilities that every one of us

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:90%
has when we get aware of that.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Aware.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:51.660 align:middle line:84%
The second option, those
are less evolved beings,

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:84%
but technologically
very advanced.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:84%
They use different portals
and different technologies

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:90%
in order to move through that.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And allegedly, we have
had a time on this planet

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:11.670 align:middle line:84%
where entities were using
the natural flow of energies

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.699 align:middle line:84%
and portals all over
the planet in order

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:19.020 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
people from their time.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.786 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: One of the things
I want to ask you about--

00:34:21.786 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and during this discussion,
we had an incident

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
when I worked for a
private laboratory

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.659 align:middle line:90%
where we advertised--

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and part of this continued
program in time travel.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:90%
This was in the '90s.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.239 align:middle line:84%
We advertised for
time travelers.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We put it in magazines, and
we didn't have the internet

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:90%
back then, but in magazines.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:84%
We had a person come forth
and said, I'm a time traveler.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:84%
This person looked
extraordinary.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
My experiences and my
background with ETs,

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:84%
as soon as we met this person in
a location in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:90%
he was tall and lanky.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
His arms were not
proportional to his body.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
He had very, very,
very light skin.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things-- and
I was pretty blunt with him

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
when we he introduced
himself as George Arthur.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Now you can look
in the internet,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and there's stories about
this George Arthur guy.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I said,
where did you come from?

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:34.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you want to know
exactly where I come from

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:90%
or where I'm at right now?

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, where were you born?

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's very difficult
to explain because I was born

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.350 align:middle line:90%
1,000 years into the future.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I came back in time.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, we did a lot of
vetting on this guy.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.780 align:middle line:84%
We could not--
and one of my jobs

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
there was to do a complete
background on him.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.600 align:middle line:90%
We could find zero, nothing.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find anything.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Now he told us--

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that was very baffling.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.800 align:middle line:84%
He told us he could
show us how to do this,

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.890 align:middle line:90%
how to go back in time.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.980 align:middle line:90%
There's a place in Arizona.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.050 align:middle line:90%
He called it Secret Mountain.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Randy
Cramer about this.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:90%
He knows where the place is.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:90%
We went there.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Scientists brought equipment.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
We drove from Austin,
Texas, out there.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:90%
He met us.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:90%
He took us out there.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:27.610 align:middle line:90%
We had four-wheel drives.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Took us a long
time to get there.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going to
walk down this canyon--

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:90%
it was an actual canyon--

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to show
you how to do it.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:90%
But don't follow me yet.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So he walks down this canyon,
and it's a one-way canyon.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.120 align:middle line:84%
There's only one way
in and one way out.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.560 align:middle line:90%
He walks down this canyon.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We waited 45 minutes
and he doesn't come out.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And the canyon curves a
little bit to the left.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
So we decided--

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I was the guinea pig who said,
I'll go down and look for him.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.550 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Wow.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He disappeared.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:84%
There's only one way
he could have got out--

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:12.410 align:middle line:84%
was climbing a 2,000-foot
cliff because the canyon--

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
the path going in the
canyon stopped at a wall.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:90%
It was 2,000 feet up.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.070 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any portholes
that we could find.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
caves or tunnels.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It had rained a day before.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a little
puddle of water,

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:90%
but it was only six inches deep.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:90%
He disappeared.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:84%
My question to you
is, in today's time,

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:90%
have you met any humans--

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not beings, but
humans that have traveled

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:90%
forward or back in time?

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I know the
people that are part

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:90%
of this group of time units.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I mean,
that's the translation

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I would give to that.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if people from
now are using technology

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.180 align:middle line:90%
in order to go somewhere else.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how far
the conventional military

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:90%
is using those technologies.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's it.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which brings me
to the next question is,

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
are there areas on planet
Earth such as this place that

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:84%
have been known to be ancient
portals that are already there,

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:30.710 align:middle line:84%
that either need to be activated
or are always activated?

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:84%
The way I understand it is
that there was a time where

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:84%
human people were
in a closed context

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:44.120 align:middle line:84%
to different other species,
and it was pretty common

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that they used the
natural flow of energies

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
in order to go through
portals and in order

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:90%
to connect with human people.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And through time, the memory
or the collective memory

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:90%
has forgotten about that.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Also, because we-- or humans
experienced a time of chaos

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:07.580 align:middle line:84%
back then, and people
tried to bring out

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
the influences on Earth in
order to see what went wrong.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.525 align:middle line:84%
And we already
talked about that,

00:39:14.525 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that there were some harmful
influences and a lot of chaos

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.760 align:middle line:90%
that went down the road.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So the way I understand it, it
was pretty common that species

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:84%
connected through portals
with human people on Earth.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you heard
of any of this, Rick,

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:90%
in your documentation?

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.505 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No, other than--

00:39:44.505 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
knowledge of what

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Tim was talking about as
far as a group of people.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, back in--

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.000 align:middle line:84%
we might have had
them back in my days,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.700 align:middle line:84%
but I was never briefed in
any kind of program like that.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:02.220 align:middle line:84%
We just solicited during
the '90s people that

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:90%
claimed to be time travelers.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And George Arthur
was the only one

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that actually was able
to prove something to us.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were offering
a lot of money, $50,000.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he never got
his money because-- but one

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:84%
of the questions I have is that
the people that were recruited

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.600 align:middle line:90%
as--

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the humans that were
recruited into the program

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:30.280 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrials, were
they from this time period

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:84%
or were they from a
future time period?

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They were
from the time period

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.320 align:middle line:90%
of the 2000, 2010-ish years.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they came from the
present or the present time

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:90%
and were recruited by--

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which kind
of factor they used.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Those people are
pretty intelligent,

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:84%
smart guys, and also pretty
dedicated to the mission

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:90%
of protecting the timeline.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.110 align:middle line:90%
I think those were the factors.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.274 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were thoroughly
vetted and investigated

00:41:05.274 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:90%
and trained?

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Did they have to go to training?

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the Greys put
up a training system.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.770 align:middle line:84%
They also explained
the technology.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.030 align:middle line:84%
They gave the algorithms
and how to use that.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So from that time on, I think
they are pretty autonomous.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How advanced now is
the technology of portal travel?

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are we allowed to go
through and come back at will?

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So from the
conversations I've had,

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I learned that back
in the ancient days,

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.710 align:middle line:84%
those portals were utilizing
natural dynamics, natural flows

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:84%
of energy, and they used some
kind of stone, stony device

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.780 align:middle line:84%
in order to put up
coordinations upon that.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.807 align:middle line:84%
And also, using it as a
kind of consciousness--

00:41:57.807 --> 00:41:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a
consciousness-assisted

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:90%
technology of some sort.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, but
build from stone--

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Organic.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, it was organic.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:84%
They used stones
and carved inside

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.140 align:middle line:84%
of that coordinates and
different hieroglyphs.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And they used those
stones in order

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:84%
to approach or go through
natural occurring portals

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:84%
where they need specific time
correlations and specific

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.810 align:middle line:90%
alignments with stars.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't go
through that spontaneously.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very certain times.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think the equinoxes are
used-- they're utilized there.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.310 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking--

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, natural
technology that uses

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
natural things and
natural physics

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:90%
in order to go through that.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Time moved on.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Technology is different today.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It's more sophisticated
in some ways.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So as much as I'm aware, people
can open or even relocate

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:84%
even singular matter or atoms
inside of a time dimension.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's more
sophisticated today.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: One of the
things that I found out

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
during my time in
counterintelligence

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.400 align:middle line:84%
working on this
time travel project,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.330 align:middle line:84%
the United States government
prepares for everything.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And they prepared a group of
people for time traveling.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.530 align:middle line:84%
This was probably
in the early '70s.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
when this happened.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But some of them were
astronauts and some of them

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.640 align:middle line:84%
were just military
personnel, and there

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.010 align:middle line:90%
were a few scientists.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
project, they thought

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:84%
they could complete the
project and actually open up

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.690 align:middle line:90%
fabrics of space.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.510 align:middle line:84%
They prepared this team
of people to go in.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe there were 15
or 20 in the first group.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they did was they

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:90%
gave him these markers.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
would be when you walk--

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.770 align:middle line:84%
if they got through the portal,
number one, where are they?

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They've got to find this
other side of this portal

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
to come back, so they
had these markers.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was all sorts of
different types of systems that

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:32.015 align:middle line:84%
they were using to mark some
location so it wouldn't--

00:44:32.015 --> 00:44:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they didn't have GPS.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.740 align:middle line:84%
If they were going through, they
wouldn't have a GPS or the MTR,

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.040 align:middle line:84%
the military back in the-- the
military satellite they used

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.890 align:middle line:90%
back in the '60s before GPS.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:90%
So they had to prepare for that.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I saw the training manual.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Very thick.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And they went through virtually
everything to prepare.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things-- we
talked about this a little bit

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:90%
earlier--

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that they
prepared for and they told

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:84%
these astronauts-- they
call them time astronauts--

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.230 align:middle line:84%
was when you got to
a location and you

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:84%
found that you
were back in time,

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you can't manipulate
anything because you've

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:90%
got a paradox there.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.030 align:middle line:84%
If you go back and find
yourself walking down the street

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.550 align:middle line:90%
or somehow--

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:22.420 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.040 align:middle line:90%
There would be a paradox.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.075 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that training
manual was fascinating,

00:45:28.075 --> 00:45:30.963 align:middle line:84%
and I wish I could find
it to bring it forth.

00:45:30.963 --> 00:45:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were so many
things they trained them.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.882 align:middle line:84%
I can't go into
great details now.

00:45:34.882 --> 00:45:35.840 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the time.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But there were so
many other things

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that they prepared
them for, just in case

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:90%
they could go back in time.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.485 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's called
the quantum collapse.

00:45:44.485 --> 00:45:48.460 align:middle line:84%
If people meet different
versions of themselves

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and they interact with them,
a quantum collapse can occur

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and timelines would fail.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's say
you went back in time

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and you had killed
your grandfather.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.570 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
that timeline now?

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you exist when you come back?

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you not exist?

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a whole 'nother
timeline that's created?

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.722 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So you have a
dead grandpa, for sure.

00:46:15.722 --> 00:46:16.680 align:middle line:90%
That's going to happen.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:90%
But besides that, the--

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.710 align:middle line:84%
so there's nothing
that can fade away.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Things that are probable and
possible still will occur.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So if someone goes back in
time, kills their grandfather,

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:38.040 align:middle line:84%
they have this
memory inside of time

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.470 align:middle line:84%
that they go somewhere
and do something.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So a different time
string would appear then.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
One thing would
fade, but you still

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:52.240 align:middle line:84%
exist because you're still
aware of your existence

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and you just--

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:57.550 align:middle line:84%
the universe will merge
the failed timelines

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:58.990 align:middle line:90%
into a stable one.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:84%
If you do something that
has a tremendous effect

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:08.440 align:middle line:84%
on the stability of a timeline,
then a quantum collapse

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.960 align:middle line:84%
can occur, which
means that a stable--

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.960 align:middle line:90%
once stable timeline would fail.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, the universe
then tries the best logic

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.900 align:middle line:84%
it has in order to
merge it again back

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:84%
to the time string in the middle
of it to make it stable again.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think this is
a fascinating discussion.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:30.730 align:middle line:90%
I talked about the past.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I talked about what we did
in the 1970s and 1980s, what

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.380 align:middle line:84%
we did experimenting with time
travel, the different projects

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in
regarding time travel.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And now Tim brings
us up to the present

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.160 align:middle line:90%
and even into the future.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating discussion.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I love that.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.545 align:middle line:84%
I love the perspectives, and
I'm really thankful that we can

00:47:52.545 --> 00:47:54.450 align:middle line:90%
talk about that, discuss it.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And also, one thing that makes
me feel pretty comfortable

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.090 align:middle line:84%
in my position is just to
know that the universe got us

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:06.090 align:middle line:84%
covered, that we
cannot ultimately fail,

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:11.860 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately can only
succeed whatever we do.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well said, gentlemen.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

>>DOTY: Thank you.

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Huge pleasure.

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.497 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: Next on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:48:27.497 --> 00:48:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, how do you think
the Greys actually perceive us?

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: In some ways, they depend
on some people on this planet,

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:39.618 align:middle line:84%
but they also do not
care if there are losses.

00:48:39.618 --> 00:48:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do the
interfrequentials

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.170 align:middle line:90%
view our world?

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They do want to help
because their existence depends

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:50.150 align:middle line:84%
on a well-evolving
universe because everything

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:51.080 align:middle line:90%
is connected.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why is Earth attractive
to all these different ETs?

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The potential of
evolution of humans on Earth

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:01.460 align:middle line:84%
is pretty high because
they have all this chaos.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.730 align:middle line:84%
With all that stress and
all their challenges,

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.410 align:middle line:90%
they have to evolve quickly.
