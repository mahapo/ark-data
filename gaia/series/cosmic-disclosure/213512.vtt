00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
We're with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:10%
a retired special agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Today, we discuss a covert
defense research agency, DARPA.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here, Emery.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard, what is DARPA?

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DARPA is an agency controlled
by the Department of Defense.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It monitors all
government contracts.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Defense Advanced
Research Project Agency.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:10%
That's the abbreviation DARPA.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And they deal almost exclusively
with special access programs

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
dealing with high technology
or advanced technology.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're given
to-- given contracts

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:84%
to a number of different
defense contractors

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
all over the United States
and even all over the world.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
foreign companies

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that can get contracts
through DARPA.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> What number of contracts
are we talking here worldwide

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:90%
for just DARPA?

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, thousands and
thousands of contracts.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:10%
For instance, the new
plane, new bomber that's

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:10%
being built, the B-21.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:10%
That's given out, that's-- we're
talking about a $300 billion

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:10%
contract and building about
hundreds of those planes.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
That's just an example of a
contract that is monitored

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and controlled by DARPA.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, DARPA doesn't
make anything.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
DARPA just controls
the money that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is transferred from the
Department of Defense

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to DARPA and from DARPA
to the defense contractor.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> What's DARPA's primary focus?

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In the '60s, they created
DARPA to control and manage

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:90%
the number--

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
the high number
of contracts that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
are being given to
defense contractors.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's what DARPA does.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:90%
They just manage the contracts.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>> And who do they report to.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> They report to the
Department of Defense,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the acquisition and
budgeting office.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Is DARPA strictly in the
United States of America?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Or is it like an
international body?

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:10%
>> They're primarily
in the United States,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:10%
but they have satellite offices
all over the United States that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:10%
controls contractor
contracts within the defense

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:10%
contractor's area of operation.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But they also have contracts
with foreign governments.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:90%
For instance, Australia.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of contracts
being monitored and managed

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
by DARPA from
Australian contractors.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:10%
If you go to Pine Gap near
Alice Springs in Australia,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:10%
you can find an
NSA facility there.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And then an NSA facility,
National Security Agency

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
facility, control satellites
both uplink and downlink

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
of information from
defense satellites and even

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Australian satellites.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And so there's contractors there
that are controlled by DARPA.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:84%
DARPA gives them contracts
to help manage the facilities

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:90%
at Pine Gap.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So Pine Gap, I know, has
been there quite a while.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:90%
So these are ongoing contracts.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not just for building
things, and they're done.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>> No, they're
ongoing contracts.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:90%
They're reoccurring.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
They call them
reoccurring contracts,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
which every year, at the end
of fiscal year, September,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
they re-examine the
contracts, give them

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
more money or less money,
but they renew the contracts

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:90%
for the next fiscal year.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Some contracts are for one
year or multiple years,

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:90%
I think, up to five years.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I think law within
our government,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
you can give a contract
for a period of five years.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it has to be maybe
reissued or out for bidding

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the relevance to
extraterrestrial reality?

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DARPA creates contracts for
certain defense contractors that

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
relate directly to
nonhuman intelligence,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
nonhuman technology,
and nonhuman biologics.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
They give these contracts to
certain defense contractors,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
such as Raytheon, Lockheed
Martin, Skunk Works, Grumman.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
There's, I think, 190 different
companies that currently have--

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
within the last
fiscal year, currently

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
have billions and billions of
dollars in defense contracts

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:90%
through DARPA.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And the majority
of those dealing

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:90%
with reverse engineering.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, can you give us an
example of a task that DARPA

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:90%
would be issued to do?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the items that I was
privately involved with was

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
a communications device that
we had acquired on a crashed

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial craft.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Motorola Corporation, which
makes defense radios and police

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
radios, two-way radios,
advanced communications devices,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
they were given a
very large contract.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact amount,
but it was up around $35 to $40

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
billion to examine and
try to reverse engineer

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
a communications device
that we got from a nonhuman

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they spent years
and years and years

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand and
try to reverse engineer

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.177 align:middle line:84%
this particular
communications device.

00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you telling me that's
where the iPhone came from?

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.562 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:05:58.562 --> 00:06:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they accomplish
the mission?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>> They didn't.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.725 align:middle line:90%
They haven't yet.

00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:90%
No, they haven't yet.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the technology
is so advanced.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
We have to develop newer
technology to understand

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial technology.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to advance our
technology to the point

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
where we could look in
at something that's alien

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:90%
and try to understand it.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And they estimate
that we would have

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
to advance our technology
20 to 25 years in order

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand this
communications device.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> All that makes
complete sense.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's get an example of how
DARPA task another contractor

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:90%
out for, like, biologics.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's at
Johns Hopkins University,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
which everybody knows is one
of the most advanced research

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:90%
centers in the East Coast.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:10%
And they built a
facility a few years ago,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:10%
which pertains directly
to nonhuman intelligence.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And they received a $119
million contract through DARPA.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's public information?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's information.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But the $119 million, where it
went is not public information.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But the rumors out
there is that they're

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:84%
studying extraterrestrial
biologics at this facility.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:90%
It's heavily armed.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It has advanced
systems for security.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of top-level
scientists and doctors working

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:90%
at that facility.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, people
suspect it to be pertaining

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
to a special access
program, which

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:90%
deals with extraterrestrials.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think they would
include John Hopkins in this

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
when that facility should be
like on Kirtland Air Force base?

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that John Hopkins
for years have dealt with this

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
program, have experimented with
tissues that were sent there,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
because they have advanced
research facilities there

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and high-level trained doctors.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I think one of the
reasons is that they--

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
because the facility is such
a renowned facility and that

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
they have a Defense
Department contract facility

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
in a different building
than from where

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the hospital and the
Medical Center is,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
one of the reasons.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And you and I both know the
best place to hide something is

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
in broad daylight,
right down the street.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why they put it there.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's other facility
that deals with this.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Lovelace Research Center
at Kirtland Air Force Base

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
is another facility that
they've done research

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:90%
with nonhuman biologics.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
There's very little known
about that facility other

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
than some of the
people have spoken out.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
There was an article
in a newspaper,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
an Albuquerque newspaper
some years ago about somebody

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
speaking up and saying, we
have nonhuman pieces of bodies

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
at that facility that
they've dealt with.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And this person
wasn't a scientist.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
It was somebody who
just worked there,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
but he opened up the gate,
so to speak, to question what

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:90%
that facility was used for.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I directly worked for
Lovelace While at Kirtland Air

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Force Base, and they were
definitely doing that.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You know.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.850 align:middle line:84%
What our special access
programs and how are they

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:90%
related to DARPA's mission?

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Special access programs
contains one of the highest

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
classifications of any type of
programs that the government

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:90%
has.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And they deal exclusively,
almost exclusively

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial biologics,
extraterrestrial biological

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
entities, technologies
pertaining

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrial crafts,
communications devices

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
pertaining to extraterrestrials.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Anything extraterrestrials is
covered under a special access

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
program, which contains
sensitive compartmented

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
information that
can't be disclosed.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's laws
out there on the books,

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
titled 50 United
States code, Title 18.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:10%
There's a number of laws that
protects the special access

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:10%
programs from being disclosed
or even talked about.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that the government

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
does, they hide some of these
special access programs in Title

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:84%
40 United States Code, which
is the Atomic Energy Act.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Atomic Energy Act
is exempt from FOIA requests.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you put something
in the Atomic Energy

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Act, which is Title
42 United States Code,

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:90%
you can't get it through FOIA.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>> They hide it all.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>> They hide it all.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Not even you could
get it or, I mean, OSI.

00:10:36.248 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If there was a need to know,
a government agency could get

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.270 align:middle line:90%
it, yes.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
What advanced
technology can you talk

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:90%
about that's related to DARPA?

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Alien technology.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:90%
What they--

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.982 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of examples
could you give us?

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, DARPA doesn't
hold this technology.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
They give it to the
defense contractors.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And they monitor those
programs, these contracts

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that these defense
contractors are working on.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're directly related
to nonhuman intelligence.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And everything that this
defense contractor is doing

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:90%
is being reported back to DARPA.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And almost every facility,
every contract facility

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
where there's a DARPA
contract, there's

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
DARPA personnel that work there
that monitor these programs.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
There's also AFOSI agents
at every single one

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
of these facilities monitoring
that security program.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're in
charge of security?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They're in
charge of security.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any other
contracted security that's part

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:90%
of that?

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The company can
contract out security.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.402 align:middle line:84%
But the overall
security, the not

00:11:46.402 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
necessarily the
physical security--

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> They oversee.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The administrative
security is done by AFOSI.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, is DARPA the
only organization

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that's in control of all
extraterrestrial technology

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:90%
and biology?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's compartmented.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.490 align:middle line:84%
DARPA gets the contract
or the requirement

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
for the contract from the
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.652 align:middle line:84%
>> So they don't
have another place,

00:12:11.652 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the Defense Intelligence
Agency says, no,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
send it to DARPA,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:90%
let's send it over here instead?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> No, everything is
filtered through DARPA.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:84%
By law, DARPA has to
control these contracts.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
They're professionals
that do that, manage it.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Contract administration,
they call

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
it, where they're
administering those contracts,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
make sure every I is
dotted, every T is crossed,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and every requirement
in those contracts

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
are being applied
through the contractor.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what DARPA's
responsibility is.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
The information that
is reported back

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:84%
to DARPA regarding
whatever contract

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
they're on, for
instance, if there

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of
extraterrestrial widget

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
that is being given
to Boeing, and Boeing

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to remanufacture
that or reverse engineer

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that, that information
eventually goes back

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
to the intelligence agency,
Defense Intelligence Agency,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:90%
through DARPA.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So what have we learned
about reverse-engineered

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial technology?

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we learned that there's
a lot of items out there that we

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
obtained through crash
retrieval or maybe given to us

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's rumors out there
that they've left crafts for us

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:90%
to reverse engineer or to use.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They even left some ETs here to
assist us in reverse engineering

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:90%
those or to fly them.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so those
technologies are here

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
that we, the United
States government,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:84%
is trying to reverse engineer to
use to advance our technology.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, most of the
ET technology, as I understand,

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is far more advanced than
ours, maybe thousands of years,

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
maybe 10,000 of years,
maybe a million years.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we're given this
widget, but sometimes we

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
can't even understand what this
is for or how it could be used.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to advance our
technology to the point

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that we can understand
this, this widget, and all

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
the components within that or
how it's being manufactured.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a large
learning curve.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.185 align:middle line:84%
>> It must take time and even
more programs to do that.

00:14:27.185 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, and money.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Programs for programs.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of money.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So when the military, Air
Force, Navy, Army, Marines,

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
finds a craft or a body,
how is that handled?

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Does it go right to DARPA?

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:90%
What's the protocol for that?

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they immediately have
to notify the crash recovery

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:90%
teams.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's included in a
military regulations, Department

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
of Defense regulation.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:84%
The crash retrieval
people, the Air Force,

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
would respond and
recover the items

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that nothing
is kept by whoever found it.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's one job of AFOSI
coming in and debriefing

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and assuring that all the
materials found at that crash

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:84%
site has been turned
over to the government.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And once that's done,
then all that material

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:90%
goes to the Air Force.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a process
whereby the Defense Intelligence

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Agency Foreign Technology
Division gets involved

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:84%
in dishing out contracts
to try to understand what

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:84%
this craft, how this craft
lies, what this craft is,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.855 align:middle line:90%
how it's made, and so forth.

00:15:33.855 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You're telling me there's
definitely a lot of research

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
before anything
is actually made.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I think at one time I was
told that from the time

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
a craft is found at a
crash site and recovered,

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:84%
everything recovered and
the crash site cleaned up,

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
the time that a contract
is given to a contractor

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:90%
can be up to five years.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Air Force keeps that
in captivity or in storage

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
at Papoose Lake or
Area 51 or Tonopah.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're probably
analyzing it themselves.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But they have to, number
one, make sure it's safe,

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
the craft is safe to
give to a contractor,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
that there's not some
kind of defense mechanism

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:90%
that could harm people.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And number two, whether
there's hazardous materials

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
in that craft that
could make humans sick.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And then number
three, that they have

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
a way of transporting that
craft from point A to point B.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do they
triage that, Richard?

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Because let's say
a craft came down

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
today, tomorrow and the next
day, and they have three

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:90%
craft now.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say which one
gets put on the shelf

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and which one are they
going to move forward with?

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's what they
can understand and how quick

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:84%
they can answer those three
questions of whether it's safe

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
for a human, if there's
any defense mechanism,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
a weapon system on board that
if a defense contractor touches

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.950 align:middle line:84%
this, this thing is going to
explode or something like that.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
And then a method or
a way to transport it.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Once they've answered
all those questions,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
then they can decide on,
number one, who gets it?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a sole
source bid, meaning

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
only one particular
contractor, like

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Skunk Works would get
this, because they're

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
the only ones who could deal
with it and reverse-engineer it,

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's going
to be put out for bid.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's put
out for bid, that's

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
another strange
entity within DARPA,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
because they can't tell
everybody exactly what it is.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So they have to work
around all that, where

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:90%
they speak in generalities.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:90%
They have a foreign aircraft.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:90%
They have a foreign--

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
they don't call it
extraterrestrial at that point.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But once the final
contract is written,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:84%
then you'll see the word
extraterrestrial or nonhuman

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, nonhuman craft
or some terminology like that.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> They ever like cater
to a specific contractor,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
knowing in the past this
contractor did better than this

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:90%
one?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Is there a lack of manpower?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> They use sole source.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:84%
It's called a sole
source bid, meaning

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Skunk Works will say we want it
because we've done 20 of them

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:90%
before or whatever.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:90%
And so the government knows.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's provisions
in US law that

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
allow sole-source
contracts to be issued.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can--

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.430 align:middle line:84%
even during my time, we had
only one particular defense

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:84%
contractor that
could do something.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we always
gave them the bed,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
because there was nobody else
out there that was qualified

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:90%
to do that particular work.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And for instance, Skunk Works
have done these things before.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:84%
They have the facilities,
they have the techniques,

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and they have the
scientists and technicians.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
something like this,

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
the only place to send it to
would be Skunk Works or maybe

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Boeing.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's called
sole-source bidding.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So how much of this tech is
within the government compared

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to within the
civilian corporations?

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
the civilian contractors do,

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
developmental programs.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They work-- say, for
instance, this year they just

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
reverse-engineered or
had a craft that they

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:90%
were reverse-engineering.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Now they learn a lot from that.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Now there's only a certain
amount of information

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
they can maintain as
a proprietary item.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> To bring to the public.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:90%
But they get the idea.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't take the idea
out of the scientist's mind.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So they can have their own
research and development

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of them do.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Skunk Works, Lockheed, Skunk
Works, Boeing, Raytheon,

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Grumman had them,
a number of other,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
L3Harris, a number
of contractors

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
have their own research
and development going on

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.600 align:middle line:84%
based on what they learned
from extraterrestrial crafts.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So they can do their own
research and development

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
for items that can be used
in the general public.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:84%
But they can't connect that item
with a reverse-engineered alien

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:84%
craft, because that would
be a violation of law.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And where do you see
all this research taking us

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, hopefully,
at some point,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and I think a bill in Congress
would have to be generated

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
to allow some of this
information and some of this

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
technology that we have
developed or obtained from

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials to be
filtered through the public.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know Colonel Corso
wrote a book about this.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I believe in what he
wrote, although maybe not

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
everything in the book is
absolutely 100% correct.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think everything he
wrote about reverse-engineering

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and what we got from
extraterrestrials is fact.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
There's many other people
have reported this, including

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
a scientist from Boeing once
that talked about it at a UFO

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:90%
convention some years ago.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:90%
So I believe that.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
have gotten technology

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.250 align:middle line:90%
from extraterrestrials.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And we filtered
it in to society.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we hope we can do

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:84%
with some of this other
technology that wouldn't damage

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
national security, wouldn't
upset the apple cart,

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, or let the
North Koreans or the Russians

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.262 align:middle line:90%
or Chinese or Iranians--

00:21:31.262 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Use it something negative.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of the positive
things that you could mention

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:90%
that will help humanity?

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Medical research.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:84%
There's so much out there, I
don't know a whole lot about it,

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:84%
but there's people out
there a lot smarter than me

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that are doctors
and like yourself,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
who is medically qualified
to understand that there's

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
medicines that we
could obtain or learn

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:84%
to make from extraterrestrial
technology or something that can

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
cure cancer, some
kind of new apparatus

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that can-- diagnostic
system that can tell

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
whether a person has or
will eventually have cancer

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:90%
or some other genetic defect.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I think those things that
we should be working on

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:90%
to get that out to the public.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think right now we
do know about these things

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials
either given us

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:84%
or we've obtained from them
through reverse-engineering.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important factor

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:90%
in the disclosure process.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
We need that information
out for mankind.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Why holding that back would
harm national security?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't. harm
national security.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
It would help us and
to help all mankind.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I agree with that,
and that's very beautiful.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:84%
How much is DARPA centric to
extraterrestrial technology?

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, certainly not
everything that DARPA

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
administers pertains to
extraterrestrial technology.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of programs
on the outside, so to speak,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that aren't special
access programs.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the B-21
aircraft or some contracts

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that deals with advanced
propulsion systems,

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:84%
they can be used in
the private sector.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anything to
do with advanced technology

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of alien
technology, things like that,

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:90%
or just a new fountain pen.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know about
this until somebody directed me

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.545 align:middle line:84%
There's a company
out there, and I

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
can't remember the
name of the company,

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
but that has a
contract through DARPA

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
to develop a special pen to be
used by military personnel that

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
can write in any
type of environment,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
including space and
anti-gravity and all sorts

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
of different environments.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And this company is
actually working on that.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure at
some point, if they

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:84%
do create a pen
like that, which I'm

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
sure they will, that's
going to be an easy way

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to get to the public, because
it's not advanced technology.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a pen you can
write upside down or--

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It can't be used against you.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, in the water,
in a deep environment,

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
positive pressure
environment, all these things.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
That's just one
example of something

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:90%
DARPA is administering.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
That has nothing to do with
extraterrestrial technology,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
but could help the
public today or tomorrow.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, they have
a they're working

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:84%
on a new similar
to a thumb drive,

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very small
device that a person

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
can hold in their hand
and touch the computer.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And now everything
from that computer

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
is going into that device,
not through the computer,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:90%
but through your body.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.280 align:middle line:90%
There's a way that that--

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.203 align:middle line:84%
I saw it demonstrated at
a scientific convention--

00:24:45.203 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fascinating.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> --where you have-- you hold
this thing in your and then you

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
touch the computer, and what's
on the screen goes into this,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and then you play
it the same way.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:84%
You download it
into this computer.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
That's amazing that you don't
need to put it in the computer

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can be
some distance away.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I guess it works on frequencies.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It would have to
be bigger for me,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:84%
because that little thing
I'd lose in two seconds.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's, there's a lot
of technology out there.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
A new keyboard system
that's all voice-controlled,

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:84%
these things are
going on within DARPA

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
right now, which I don't
know that it's classified,

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
but there's companies out there
working on a new voice control

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.417 align:middle line:90%
keyboard for your computer.

00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to type it.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:90%
You just talk.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And it automatically
goes in there

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and it makes
corrections for you.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's software probably
more than the hardware,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:84%
but it's a program that that's
being developed by a contractor,

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I think, L3Harris that will
do away with a keyboard.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> As a percentage, how much of
that is extraterrestrial and how

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
much is not, you
think, with DARPA?

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>> A guess, and I wouldn't--

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this
for a fact, but I

00:25:54.910 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
guess it's about a 60% to 70%
pertains to nonhuman technology,

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and the other 40% or 50%
contains to just nothing

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:84%
to do with human
nonhuman intelligence.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a lot.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's more than half.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So that means half--
more than half

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:84%
their budget is going
towards extraterrestrials.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But you got to
understand that the budget,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:84%
as directly proportional to what
they're trying to develop out

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:84%
here in the defense industry,
it takes a lot of money,

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:84%
because they have to
advance their technology.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:84%
They might have to
build a new machine

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to examine something
or take something apart

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
that's of alien technology.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a particular
example of this.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, a
defense contractor

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:84%
got a piece, not the whole
thing, but a piece of a craft.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And they gave it to a
particular defense contractor.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And defense contractor
says, number one,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:84%
we have to develop
something to develop this

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:90%
or to understand it.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So they spent millions and
millions of dollars on--

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I guess, they got the engineers
to develop it and create

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:84%
a machine that could do
what they needed to do.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And now that's millions
of dollars spent just

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
to develop a machine
that can analyze

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrial device.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
That's just an example of
what they're dealing with.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> There have these really
private secret auctions at Los

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Alamos that once they build
something-- like one time,

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.110 align:middle line:84%
they had a piece of a craft,
and they needed to get a piece

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of that craft, but they didn't
have anything strong enough

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.900 align:middle line:90%
to get a sample of it.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So they had to build this giant
diamond cutting graphene machine

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:90%
just to get a sample of it.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And once they did
it, that machine

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
is now never going
to be used again.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:84%
It sits on a shelf
for 20 years or so,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and then they sell
this stuff after 30,

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:90%
40 years at the auction.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's amazing how much money
they put into something just

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to get something and then
trash the whole laboratory.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a good example
right there, Emery.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of any nonhuman
intelligences working for DARPA

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:84%
or working with the
scientists in DARPA?

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:84%
- Well, I think we know of
one at Area 51 named J-Rod.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly what that
entity is, but as I understand,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:90%
he's assisting.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number
of defense contractors

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:84%
out there at Papoose
and Area 51 that

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:84%
are assisting in
reverse-engineering

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:90%
of flying crafts.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's primarily
what they do out there.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, I would
believe that we

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:84%
have at least one particular
extraterrestrial that

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
is assisting in these DARPA
project or DARPA contracts.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And we may have more than one.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
There are rumors
that we have maybe up

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
to 10 different
extraterrestrials.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But I know of one, and
that would be J-Rod.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything about DARPA
that may be part of disclosure?

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I think revealing the
defense contractors who

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
are dealing directly
with nonhuman technology,

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I think we can--

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that should
be a hidden secret.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that people should
know that we do have somebody

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
out there, defense contractor,
that is trying to understand

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.880 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial technology,
because that's going to be one

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:90%
of the questions people ask.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> If we do a disclosure
right now and say, you know,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:84%
we have a craft from 1947
or maybe before that,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying
to analyze that.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've had 25 or 30 crash
recovery operations since then,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to
understand all this,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:90%
that all comes into play.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the fact that
the people want to know this,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to-- they
don't have to be told everything

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:84%
about these crafts,
but just the fact

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that we do have defense
contractors trying to understand

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.827 align:middle line:90%
these to better our technology.

00:29:50.827 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the government
would step up and protect those

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.252 align:middle line:84%
defense contractors if they
were ordered to tell all?

00:29:58.252 --> 00:29:59.335 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:29:59.335 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to
keep their own secrets.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And they don't want
to share anything.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And the defense contractors--

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how they
make the money.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> --are just exactly like that.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in summary, DARPA is
the center of control for all

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:90%
this information to come into.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:90%
And there are no others, right?

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not that I know of.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.052 align:middle line:90%
DARPA controls the contracts.

00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And the information
comes back through DARPA

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:84%
to the government, or
do they report directly

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:90%
to the government.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.350 align:middle line:90%
DARPA reports directly to--

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, the contractors.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The contractors
report to DARPA,

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and they don't report to the
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
or CIA or wherever the
contract comes from.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.590 align:middle line:90%
DARPA controls that.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a one-way street
in, and DARPA puts--

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.580 align:middle line:84%
brings it back out the
opposite direction to DARPA.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.810 align:middle line:84%
There's only about 200
people that work at DARPA.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're contract
administrators or security

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.070 align:middle line:90%
administrators.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're also what we call
keepers of the special access

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And OSI agents are
assigned to DARPA,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and then they go out to
these defense contractors.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have to have an
office within those plants,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:90%
the OSI has to.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's paid for
through that contract.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And so all the
information pertaining

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
to reverse engineering,
everything the contractors found

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and reports comes
back through DARPA,

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it's filtered
to either the Air Force

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:84%
or primarily to the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:10%
Plus, there's a council,
a council of that

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:10%
controls who gets everything.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not one person.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a contract.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And they have a legal division
because these contracts

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:90%
have to be a legal document.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So all these people get
together to decide in which

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:90%
contractor gets which item.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But as I said before, we
have sole source contractors

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:84%
that does this work and has done
this work for years and years

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and years.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're most likely going
to get these high-level special

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:84%
access program,
reverse-engineering contracts.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The most knowledgeable person
within a DARPA structure

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that knows everything
there is or close

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to everything there is
about nonhuman intelligence

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and nonhuman technology
would be the director

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:28.400 align:middle line:84%
of DARPA, the single
person within DARPA that

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:84%
might know everything there is
to know about these contracts

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and what's required of these
defense contractors relating

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.020 align:middle line:90%
to nonhuman technology.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
