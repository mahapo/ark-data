00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today,
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:84%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.760 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.532 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When we last
spoke, you needed

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
to be vague about
certain topics.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:84%
What has changed since
then in the world?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: We have the
Pentagon Report, which has,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:10%
at least, acknowledged
the existence

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:10%
of different phenomena
in the world.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And we also see that mainstream
media are covering the stories.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way information
gets spread all over the world.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You were very hesitant
to speak about the different ET

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
races when you
were asked, but you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
mentioned at least two big
players of the universe.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Can we explore that
together today?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So in this phase
of the global development,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:90%
we can talk more about ET races.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to explore
one of the big players,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
maybe today, which
are the Greys.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the other ET
races you are familiar with,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and can you describe them?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Most common are two types
of lizard or reptilian kind

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
of beings, which
is, on the one hand,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
a type of being that looks
like a lizard, which means

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
it has a snout and
a tail, they're

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
the second kind of common
being, type of lizard being.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
These are reptilian beings
that do not look like lizards.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
They do have some
other type of structure

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:90%
they developed over that.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't say
that this is lizard.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
They appear on Earth and
they tend to be more--

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
they tend to have a greater
consciousness about what's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how are they getting
here, and what type of craft

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:90%
are you aware of, if any?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I'm not
an expert on crafts,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
but when they appear on Earth,
they try to do it covertly.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they kind of can move
the appearance of their skin

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:84%
into the direction they
want, but they also

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
used to bring out their
consciousness around them

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
so they can appear
in certain ways.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What you're saying
is they have the ability

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
to morph into something through
consciousness by blocking like,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
a field of energy
where I wouldn't

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:90%
know if you were reptilian.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
You could be blocking me and
all these cameras right now.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: True.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is,
there is technology

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:90%
that can reveal that.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So you either use scanners
to monitor the frequency,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:90%
or you use a DNA test.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you use
a DNA test, which

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is through the
nose or something,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you can find out which DNA
parts of the world have.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, from
your intel background,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
what can you say
about these beings?

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So, we on the one hand,
we have insectoids that--

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, those
praying mantis

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:84%
types, which are closely
allied to the Greys.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:90%
They used to work with them.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
They have a scientific role
in the system of the Greys.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, we, for example,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:84%
find evidence for another
kind of insectoid species

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth, which is
resembling an ant-type species.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And we also find in old
text that this species

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
had a role when the flood came
and the ancient people went

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:90%
down, down into the Earth.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:90%
So they rescued them.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you Google it,
you will see all these carvings

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
on the wall from
ancient people who

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
drew this kind of
ant people that

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:90%
helped them survive the floods.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we know
where they come from

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:90%
and what they may want with us?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So some come from
a total different reality,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and they interact
with this reality

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.866 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
connected, as you know.

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Some others come from different
planets inside of this star

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:90%
system or outside of it.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And they all have
their own agenda.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
There are also
beings that are here

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to consume experiences
which they could not

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:90%
make in other places.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:90%
These are pretty exotic beings.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
there is one type

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
of being that gets into
the experience of humans

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and tries to extract it
so then, they can benefit

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
from that without making
the traumatic experience,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:90%
for example, war.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
This is something they do not
see a sense in experiencing,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
while people on Earth, there
are some that have the destiny

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:90%
to experience that.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.437 align:middle line:84%
And they consume this kind of
experience so they can learn.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How do they do that?

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:90%
And who are they?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So this is a special type
of higher frequential being.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They do not have a
planetary system anymore.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
their origin is from,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
but what they do is to take
the experience that a human has

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:90%
made and collect it.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'll make it more clear
to you in an example.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:90%
We've found one military person.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of drawn from
his craft and was away.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So we've learned that
this interfrequential

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
being used technology to
draw the consciousness

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and the experience of somebody.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the way this person
feels that everything

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing
in this field is just

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
like some kind of
dream, and they will--

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
what they experience
in that case will--

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
it's like waking up
gently from a dream.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
From an outside
perspective, it seems

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that this pilot
experienced a sudden death,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
but from an inside
perspective, both consciousness

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
of the beings and the
consciousness of the pilot,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:90%
they merged.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So that means that this pilot
suddenly experienced a shift

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to his consciousness
and reality,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and it also clears the
traumatic experiences

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:90%
that he had in this lifetime.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You have deep
knowledge about the Greys

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that we will explore
over the course

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:90%
of the next few episodes.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Why are the Greys
so significant?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Because they are
kind of the stereotype

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of alien beings in
pop culture, as well

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:90%
as on a governmental level.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is that?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: OK, the Greys
are lacking kind

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.530 align:middle line:90%
of a spiritual development.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
They have evolved
artificially, and they also--

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:90%
and we will come to that later.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
They also came to a dead
end in a previous version

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:10%
So what they now do
is trying to correct

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:10%
their own life and their
own breedings by evolving,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:10%
and by also benefiting from the
experience other species have.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth has a
very high potential--

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:90%
and we will come back to that--

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
in experiences, and the
Greys do benefit from that.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which ET races do
our governments interact with?

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So there
are three reasons

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to interact from the viewpoint
of the government with an ET

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:90%
race.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:84%
One, technology, which is a
very, very important issue

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:90%
for the government.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Two is the threat.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
There are ET races that oppose
a threat onto the status quo

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:90%
system of the government.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And the third option is trade.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So what we see in
the last category,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that especially
humanoid species, when

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
we have similar
conditions of the planets

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:84%
fall under this
category, we have

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:84%
species that are also
warrior-type species,

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:90%
just as humans are.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Because humans have many--
have been manipulated this way,

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that they develop
some kind of attitude

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
towards military
and war, which is

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:90%
called a warrior-type species.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
warrior-type species.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And the first option
is technology.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And under this category
falls, for example, the Greys.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The Greys offered
a lot of technology

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth system
and the government

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
in order to move the development
of the Earth and the society

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.570 align:middle line:84%
into a certain
direction, but they also

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
were contracting
or doing contracts

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of governments.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, what are their
agendas to influence humanity

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.300 align:middle line:90%
that you know of?

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
Greys in particular

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
have a certain agenda to
the planet because they have

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
human material here
on Earth that they

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
need to ascend to another
level of consciousness, which

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the genetic
manipulation of the species

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And we will come
to that in detail.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But I give you an example of
a contract that has been made.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
We all know, for
example, that some crafts

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
are given to the species,
the human species,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to make them move forward
technological wise.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they reach
out to individuals,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.823 align:middle line:84%
or do they interact with our
government and militaries only?

00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interesting question.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So normally, species
interact on the level

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that they know or
they are used to.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
We have, for example,
interfrequential beings

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.116 align:middle line:90%
do not--

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:84%
who went further than having
a governmental structure

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
or something, so they
tend to communicate

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
on a different level, mostly
on an individual level.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But we also have species
that are very hierarchically

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:84%
organized and have
this kind of society.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys fall under
this kind of category,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:84%
so they very much communicated
to the governments,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:90%
especially in the first days.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, Tim, in what
way are they influencing us

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: One thing that the Greys
always have been very cautious

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:90%
about is the way--

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
the health of the timeline and
the development on this planet.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
In the last step, what
was really important

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
was giving an outlook on
what the future will be.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is a technology you
knew from Einstein and physics,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that moving through time is
something that is theoretically

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
possible, but in mainstream
technology, not been done.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And back in the 1930s, we
had a lot of discussion

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:84%
about the theory of time travel,
especially in the German kind

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:90%
of approach to physics.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But also, and I think
this is nothing new,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:90%
the Germans back then--

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking
about the Nazis--

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:90%
were experimenting on that.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
They had different
experiments on time travel,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and they did not
succeed on this.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking
about the Greys,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
they are, indeed, a
time travel species.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the only one.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
There are different
time traveling species

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that have influenced
the human history a lot.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So this was a tactical
move from the Greys

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:84%
to show how to use this
technology while still keeping

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
something for their agenda,
giving it to the government.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they reach
out to individuals

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
or do they interact with our
governments and militaries

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.170 align:middle line:90%
only?

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That depends
on the species.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
When we are talking about
interfrequentials or higher

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.240 align:middle line:84%
frequential beings,
they usually tend

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
subjects or individuals

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because they tend to have
developed further than having

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:90%
a society in that way.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking
about authoritarian species,

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:84%
like the Greys
are, they are used

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to reach out to
governmental structures,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:90%
so that's what they did.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
manipulator species,

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and they do reach
out to individuals,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%
which are kind of the breed.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, when we're
talking about hybrids,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
hybrids on this planet.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, some reptilian
species are doing manipulation

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
on the genetics of
humans, and they also

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:84%
have mostly genetically
influenced reptilian breeds

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So in order to prevent
that, these breeds

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:84%
get lost in the
trouble and busyness

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:90%
of the planetary system.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And also, in the challenges
that the installation that we

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:84%
have on this planet right now,
which is going to be removed,

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
they reach out to the breed
and they communicate with them

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So coming back to
your question, we

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
have authoritarian species
that are reaching out

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to the government because
they are used to communicating

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:90%
with the government.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:84%
We have interfrequentials
who reach out

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to individuals that are on
a kind of spiritual path,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
for example, or are open-minded
enough, or even receiving

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
some ideas that seems
to come from nowhere,

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
but they are clearly
communicating with them.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But we also have some species,
like reptilians, also,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the Greys and
different others, that

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
are reaching out to their
own breedings or hybrids.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which of
these ET races are

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
adversarial towards humans
versus supportive or neutral

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.275 align:middle line:90%
towards us?

00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we're going
to examine something

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:84%
in a future episode which
is called a installation.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a type of
installation that

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
has been said to be
put over the planet

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:84%
to stop and to hinder
humanity from developing.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So everyone listening to
this will, at some point,

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
experience how challenging
it is to move forward

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
into the spiritual
path on this planet,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
and that's kind of
this installation.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's done by a specific
reptilian race, at least,

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:15.720 align:middle line:84%
this is what the Greys
are accusing them of.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that there
are many similar cases

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
where a planet that

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
has a high potential
of development

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
gets hindered by some
kind of installation.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Some are more
sophisticated, more subtle.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Some others are pretty--

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the slaverish type of
planetary installation.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:84%
The reason why this is
happening on Earth for so long

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
is that the one here is
pretending that everything

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:90%
developed naturally.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.722 align:middle line:84%
And it's also playing with the
free will of the humans that

00:17:57.722 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:90%
are involved with this.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
involved with this right

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
now, even if a different
species come to this planet.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So for example, those
beings we talked about,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
lizard beings that can project
their consciousness outside

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:84%
to move and manipulate
their appearance,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
they cannot do that for too long
because the overall structure

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of this planet and this
installation kind of hinders

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:90%
their ability too.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that only humans
are affected by this, but also,

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:35.530 align:middle line:84%
every other kind of species
that gets into this planet.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what we find is that some
species that have already been

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:47.310 align:middle line:84%
liberated, they also tend
to be very, very helpful

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
in removing installations and
hinderings all over the place.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are
these ETs who actually

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:90%
installed the installations?

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's been said that this
is a special type of reptilian

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:84%
race that knows that humans
have a very high potential

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:90%
of development of evolution.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
There is a model that
defines the overall potential

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of evolution of species, and
humans, especially those humans

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth, tend to have
a very, very high potential.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They do not live up to that
yet because this installation,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
which has been put here
for thousands of years,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.222 align:middle line:90%
is hindering them.

00:19:44.222 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
beings out there

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
that support humanity
and are working

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:90%
against these installations?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: There are, Emery.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's right now where this
installation gets removed

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
by a consortium of
different species

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that are either working together
very closely or loosely.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it took some time
to realize what's happening

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
on Earth because it seemed that
all the potential that has been

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
let out came from the
free will of humans,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:90%
but it kind of doesn't.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Because this installation
we're talking about

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.440 align:middle line:84%
is designed to make it
very, very complex and hard

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to maintain your spiritual
path and to grow and to bring

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:90%
into your--

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to come into your
perfect potential.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's quite
a list of beings

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that are, in some
way or another,

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
trying to remove
this installation.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
We have humanoid species that
went through some similar kind

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:84%
of process, and
they come here, they

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:84%
function as tactical
advisors as well.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that
there is an effort

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
by the earthly
governments to remove it.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So even they have
a great interest

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:90%
in removing this installation.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they do right now.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Of all the
types you've met,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
who do you feel the
most connected to?

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I might sound a
bit biased because there's

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
so much information
on the Greys that

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to be released
because they're

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:90%
very relevant for the process.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
species that claims

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:84%
to have the origin of
Venus, which I've met,

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and they're pretty
harmonious in their lifestyle

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and the way they think.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I can
relate very much to them.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:84%
As well, we will explore
what we call the Being Six

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in an upcoming episode,
which are blue beings,

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to reveal
where their origin come from.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What more can you tell
us about these Venus beings?

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They claim to have
originated on the planet Venus.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:90%
They evolved from that.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So they are in a very
high consciousness state.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:40.590 align:middle line:84%
They can appear as humans, and
they do influence human people

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.853 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:22:42.853 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In a positive
or negative way?

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Oh, in a
total positive way.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, they had a very
non-challenging way to evolve.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.550 align:middle line:90%
They did not know any conflicts.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:90%
They did not know any war.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They came to realize that we
are all one, which means they

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:90%
have no room for competing.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:84%
They have no room
for war, et cetera.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No ego.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And also, they're very
loving and very harmonious,

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:90%
which totally makes sense.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
If everything is one,
then it's totally--

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:84%
it totally makes sense to
uplift and to cooperate,

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
which is a thing in the
universe and in nature itself.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And because they did that
as a collective memory or as

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
a collective, they uplifted
themselves very quickly.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But they came when they
found humans and structures,

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and they were, from
their perspective,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
working with people in the
past and the ancient worlds.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But when more challenging
influences came to Earth,

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.200 align:middle line:84%
they also came to
find that they needed

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to go away from Earth
because they are threatened.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They cannot preserve the
positive evolution here

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
on Earth because there were too
many influences right on this

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Human
emotion, human love,

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
these are things that define
humanity and our spirituality.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Does that exist in the
extraterrestrial world

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of beings?

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
There are beings that have
more deep, profound emotions.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:84%
There are other beings
that are capable of feeling

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:90%
less emotions.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But high frequential emotions
have a very, very important

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
role in the universe
because the higher

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of an
emotion and of an emotional

00:24:54.710 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
status there is, the higher the
potential of a stable universe.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
mother love, which

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:84%
is one of the ranking very high
on the table of high frequency

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:16.450 align:middle line:84%
emotions, this is something
that is super stable and also

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
connected with the natural
form of the universe

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:90%
as the universe--

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
it is just some kind
of intelligent energy

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
that became aware of the
probabilities of itself.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But through gaining mother love
as a driving factor, it becomes

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
so compassionate
and so connected

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
with the creative force
and with every one of us

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that this is something
that really keeps us alive,

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.250 align:middle line:90%
makes us stable.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Other forms-- and
not all species

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
feel that and are
capable of that.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is also a reason
why the Greys are having

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.535 align:middle line:84%
their stocks in humanity
because humans are capable

00:26:08.535 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of positive
and great emotions.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
These emotions
come from a status,

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
from a stable status
of the universe,

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and we are experiencing
them, mother

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
love as the creative love that
comes from a source that would

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:90%
be alone without the creation.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And through having the
creation, the child of creation,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.720 align:middle line:84%
it can reconnect and has a
sense and a reason to be alive,

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:90%
and that is super, super stable.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That's also the reason
why in a so-called--

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
we call that theoretical
second, the universe was female.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But we all know the universe
is neither male nor female

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.350 align:middle line:90%
but everything all at once.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is only a
theoretical second,

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:84%
but some practical-- at least,
some beings, for example,

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Being Six says that
some practical reality

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
comes from that, and
also, some challenges.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
The Greys have gotten
rid of a lot of emotions

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:84%
because they saw
them as a hindering,

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
blocking factor to
their evolution,

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:84%
but now, are realizing that
those emotional frequencies are

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
very strongly linked to
the sense and the reason

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
for being, and through
that, stability occurs.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
hate, jealousy, abuse,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and those kinds of things?

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: One might think in
an idealistic worldview

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that strong, negative emotional
states that bring frequency

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
down, like hate or
anger, are detached

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:84%
from the unified
model of source,

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:90%
and that's not the case.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:90%
It's still source.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:90%
It's still the universe.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, there is this
misunderstood concept of gods,

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know, some opponent
or counter player to that,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's pretty hard to
explain that both forces are

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:90%
the same being.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But the one status is
pretty destabilized

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and will eventually fail
because it's self-destruction,

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and self-destructing,
and the other status

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
is something where the
universe is an alternative form

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.630 align:middle line:84%
to itself where it is
compassion, and love,

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and affection, or friendship,
or fun with itself.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And that is where we want to go.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
We want to acknowledge that we
have this amazing opportunity

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to love each other,
to be together.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And even though we are one,
we can all inspire ourselves.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
We can receive ideas from
that wondrous cosmos and all

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:29.095 align:middle line:84%
those ideas, and even
explore ourselves a lot.

00:29:29.095 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So the one version will
finally and eventually fail,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and through that, in a
self-selecting process,

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:84%
fade off, and the other version
that is stable and will remain

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful, harmonious,
and living concept of home.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
