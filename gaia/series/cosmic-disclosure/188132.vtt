00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hi.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm Emery Smith, and today
we have a very special guest

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.928 align:middle line:90%
with us, David Adair.

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
David, thanks for
coming on the show.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Hello,
glad to be back again.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: We have a very
exciting topic today,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:10%
and that is the
topic of time travel.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering, what's
your take on time travel?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The whole concept
of time travel is--

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:84%
it's abstract at
best, because we don't

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:90%
have it to work with every day.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.496 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
we're familiar with.

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I've had people come up and
tell me they're scared to death

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that people will mess
with time travel.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, they'll wake
up the next morning,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
then somebody else is
president, you know,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
married to somebody
else and all that.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, that's not how
this works, in time travel,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
if you mess up, fortunately
for us, the general public,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:90%
the world, it's real personal.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
It's only going to
screw up the person who

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is directly interfacing
with the time travel.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So if they alter
their reality, they

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
altered their dimensional
space, it's only on them.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.047 align:middle line:90%
And you and I would just be--

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We're still here.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, we're still here.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Here in the same
spot, the same space.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's maybe another
level that's created.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Another branch on a tree.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But we will stay
right where we're

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:90%
at on the-- in the tree trunk.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.223 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why do
you think that is?

00:01:41.223 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Why-- why do you think
by creating other time

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
riffs that it doesn't
change anything for the time

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:90%
that you left?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You've got to have a
point of reference, like space.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have a
point reference in time.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And so time travel, what
it will do is lock on you.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And when it locks on
you, things go bad.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:90%
It hits on you, dude.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I'm going to go home
to my present wife and family,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:90%
not, you know, good luck.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I wonder whatever
happened to Emery.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:90%
He's out there in the ether.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.645 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said if people are
new working with time travel,

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:90%
don't worry about it.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.603 align:middle line:90%
Don't have any fear of it.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Let them have at it.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
They'll eventually,
by trial and by error,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
they'll get some of
the things right.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.268 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, there
have been a lot

00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
of people from the inside
projects coming forward

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:90%
that I've listened to.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And they have claimed that
they have time traveled.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.117 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: OK.

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I go
back to that position

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:84%
where if I didn't put my hands
on it, if I hadn't touched it,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.173 align:middle line:84%
I haven't worked
with it, I really

00:02:38.173 --> 00:02:39.756 align:middle line:84%
don't want to say
about it, because it

00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:90%
would be speculating.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How would it work if,
let's just say, hypothetically,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
since they made these
claims, how would that work?

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I would think you'd need
massive amounts of energy.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this earlier.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.265 align:middle line:84%
What did Doc say in
"Back to the Future"?

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, Doc Brown
from "Back to the Future."

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Where am I going to
get 10 gigawatts?

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:84%
He got out with
a lightning bolt.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And from what I've
understood and heard

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
from others in that realm,
well, apparently lightning bolts

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:90%
make mini black holes.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the black
holes, I think,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:90%
would be an integral part.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Because black holes, on
a nuts and bolts level,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:84%
would be the very thing that
would give you a wormhole.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
The very-- your time tunnel
that you travel through.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So the matrix of that
logic makes sense to me.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
But still, the power needs.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
That's like massive
amounts of power,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
that you just push a button,
and all of a sudden here,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.463 align:middle line:84%
you have all this
amazing amount of energy.

00:03:43.463 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Being that
I haven't built one,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:90%
or even are familiar with one.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:10%
But the reason so
much power is required

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:10%
is that you're going to have
to override the containment

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:10%
field of our reality.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to be able
to literally force

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
your way through that.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:10%
And that would require
like 10 nuclear power

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:10%
plants wired together.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
That's-- a gigawatt would be
what one nuclear power plant

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
would put out.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you need 10,
you've got 10 of them.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
So, the power is
just extraordinarily

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.032 align:middle line:90%
awesome in this type of work.

00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It also could
be very dangerous,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that amount of power, without
the proper containment.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And it can get away
from you, quick.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.782 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
been concerns.

00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Which it's interesting.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Concern rhymes with CERN.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:90%
You ever notice that?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I thought, boy,
that's an appropriate name,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
they doing over there?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.942 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Or slip of the
word, or slip of the lip.

00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:10%
But CERN could be
what our real science

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:57.187 align:middle line:10%
is doing to knock on the door
of time travel and stuff.

00:04:57.187 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:90%
I know what they're looking for.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for a thing
called the God Particle,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.977 align:middle line:90%
the creation of everything.

00:05:01.977 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which is a
gateway, isn't it?

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the opening.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:10%
Because it's the lowest
level of measurement.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not the-- yes.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you go inside an atom,
and then inside the atom,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
you'll find the neutron,
protons, electrons.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Go inside them, you'll
find the quarks.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Go inside the quarks, and
you'll find the strings.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't got
past the strings.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
CERN is probably
pushing on the strings

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to see what is next after
that, which I haven't

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:90%
a clue what that would be.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you see that in
our future of space travel?

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, wouldn't that
be the normal way?

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials,
now, they're claiming

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
they're interdimensional.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It-- well,
it would certainly

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:84%
solve the problems of
distance, linear distance,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and time to get
there, and the age

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:90%
of your lifespan as a species.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Time travel would be very handy.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know any
others, besides CERN,

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that is experimenting with
this type of technology?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
CERN is probably the leading
group right now working

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:90%
on such things.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But there are other cyclotrons,
not just CERN, on the planet.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:90%
There's two or three others.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In Russia too, right?

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes, Russia has one.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
China probably even has one.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is a
cyclotron, for the audience?

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's a very--

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:90%
think of what we did.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We buried a horse
track under the ground.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
You know how a horse
track is round?

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
You've got lanes
in it and all that.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's pretty much,
in a very simplified way,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:90%
is what a cyclotron would be.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just a big, round
track with magnetic fields.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And we charge particles
through there.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And we spin them till they
get to the speed of light,

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:90%
as fast as they can go.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And then at that point,
you have to decide what you

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
want to do in your experiment.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to do matter
annihilation, where

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:90%
you have them hit head-on?

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.212 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it on a
very controlled level.

00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't want to
be doing that, or otherwise

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:84%
you end up with a
nuclear weapon going off.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could they create
anti-matter from this?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.553 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
You can study
anti-matter that way.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.035 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It has a lot of things.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Dark matter.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff can be
researched through this process.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's fascinating science.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And they are making
strides in those areas.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect if we're ever
going to hit time travel

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
or be aware of it, even the
fundamentals, foundation

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to be formed, it's going to
be a group like CERN that's

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:90%
going to find it for us.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.655 align:middle line:84%
And there's always been a
lot of fears and concerns

00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
about thinking that they're
going to create a black hole,

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and the whole world gets sucked
into the 16-mile diameter

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So far, they haven't
had a problem yet.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Is it possible?

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, probable-- probably not.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.685 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
way to go about it

00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:84%
in a more sane approach, where
you don't make it that massive.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:90%
The size of CERN is 16.6 miles.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Why they make them so massive
is so they can have flexibility

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
to do different
projects and things.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you condense it
down, you can have it

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
where it will fit on
your kitchen table.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
different realm.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
It's very contained,
very precise in what

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
you're using it for.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:90%
You don't have much options.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:90%
It's just for one thing.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, the energy
that these devices

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:84%
make, that you have
experience with,

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and myself, I would
like to let the people

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
know that there's a
lot of positive things

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that can come out
of these energies,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:84%
like transmutation and
teletransportation and things

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.770 align:middle line:84%
We could easily clean up
the oceans, for instance.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's the science
behind that of transmutation,

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of the energies that come
from these devices that

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:90%
are capable of time travel?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: See, the technology
that you're dealing with

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:90%
is going to have spin-offs.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And the spin-offs
themselves are amazing.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
To accomplish time
travel, you would

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
have to have a fully
functional transporter working.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.643 align:middle line:84%
So imagine having a
transporter available.

00:09:21.643 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
does a transporter do?

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, the transporter
takes matter, breaks it down,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the energy, transfers it
from point A to point B,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.915 align:middle line:84%
reassembles it back
together, and there you are.

00:09:32.915 --> 00:09:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these
computers that

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.412 align:middle line:84%
are reassembling you,
your atomic structure?

00:09:36.412 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It would have to be.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
human that could--

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.433 align:middle line:84%
the capacity, the numbers
are in the trillions.

00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to have to
move at the speed of light

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:90%
to keep up with everything.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:90%
These would be super computers.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you have that technology
already in your pocket,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to get to time travel, the
practical applications you just

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:84%
said, all that filth and
trash we've got in the ocean.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Put your little markers
out there and outline it.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.275 align:middle line:84%
Then have the thing lock
onto it and transport it out

00:10:12.275 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:90%
of there to--

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.795 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe where we
came from, a Tupperware planet.

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:18.595 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Or I would
transport it into the sun.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Just burn it up, and it's gone.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fantastic idea.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That would be
the easiest thing to do.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You hear people
talk of multiverses.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
How does time travel
fit into multiverses?

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: You know,
we're kind of locked on,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:10%
because we're linear
travel creatures.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
We probably are so
alien to other worlds.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:90%
We linear travel.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We live chronologically,
on a timeline,

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:90%
in consecutive numbers.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, if we told
the people from Andromeda

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.643 align:middle line:84%
that we have an
appointment at 6:00 PM,

00:10:55.643 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:90%
what would they probably do?

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Laugh at us?

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Probably bust
out laughing, going,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
nothing lives like that.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And so let's explain
to them why that's a fun pun.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Because time really
does not exist.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's this time
line that we have--

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
The reason we desire time travel
so much, it's a natural desire.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:90%
You want to be unstuck in time.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:90%
We're stuck in time.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.887 align:middle line:84%
We live day-to-day, minute by
minute, by minute, by minute.

00:11:24.887 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And you want to get out of that.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, other races,
they jump all over the place.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Because time is always there.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a constant.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned that from
Einstein and other things.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:90%
It is a constant.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Which means that you can
go back anywhere in time.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:84%
You can also go to
forward anywhere in time.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.712 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to stay just
at the present, like we do.

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
in this dimension,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:84%
we're limited to the
science of this dimension,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and so are those beings
that come here, I believe,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and craft that are working
here in this dimension.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you have something
come from another dimension,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I do believe it
changes in our view

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and looks completely different,
maybe, a ball of light.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I bring this
up is the Bermuda Triangle.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:90%
What's going on out there?

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Is this some
energetic anomaly that

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
teletransportation and time

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:90%
travel?

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That
brings up the story

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
that I had with this fellow
I met [LAUGHS] in the Navy.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:90%
This is such a hoot.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I was called into Norfolk,
of [?COMNAVSURFLANT?]..

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:84%
[?COMNAVSURFLANT?] is the
command of the entire Western

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere Navy, US Navy.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's where all
the admirals are.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And an admiral called
me, and he said,

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.328 align:middle line:84%
Adair, we've got a problem
with our satellites.

00:12:49.328 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They go through the
Bermuda Triangle.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.287 align:middle line:84%
When they come out
the other side,

00:12:52.287 --> 00:12:54.023 align:middle line:84%
we've got to
reprogram immediately,

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to spin off
out of orbit, because they've

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:90%
lost their memory.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Something is coming out of
the bottom of the ocean,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:84%
emitting something,
we don't know.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm listening to him, and I
said, let me get this straight.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
You want me to go down and
fix the Bermuda Triangle?

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Can I do that before
or after lunch?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
He looks up at
me, and I thought,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.106 align:middle line:90%
that was the wrong thing to say.

00:13:18.106 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And he smiles.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:90%
He says, oh, you can have lunch.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.295 align:middle line:90%
And then go.

00:13:23.295 --> 00:13:24.095 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I go back to command,
and I have lunch.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Get in a jet, and
fly to Key West.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:10%
So when I get down
to Key West, I

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:10%
report to the
commander of the base.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:10%
He's sitting at his desk.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:10%
And I walk into his office.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:10%
And he tells me, oh, you're
here to work on the satellite

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:10%
problem.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.205 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh yeah, yeah, like I--

00:13:44.205 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that's what I'm going
to do, all right.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.958 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't got a
clue of what's going on.

00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this little
guy sitting on a couch over here

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.790 align:middle line:90%
on the left.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of a
meek, little shy fellow.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
He has this really
cool looking goatee.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:10%
And he's got this Omega
Pipe by Dr. Garbo.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting there, and
he's looking up at me.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Admiral tells me,
oh, when you get through

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
with the satellites, you're
going to be working with him.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, my, who is him?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:10%
And he says, his
name is Dr. Hynek.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:10%
And I thought I
recognized his name,

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:10%
but I've never really had
anything to do with any of it.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:90%
So I asked him.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, weren't you with a
thing called Project Blue Book?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, yes,
that's over with now.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:10%
This is later.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:10%
And I said, would you excuse me
and the commander for a minute?

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.533 align:middle line:90%
So he goes out.

00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And I talk to the commander.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I go, what, are
you assigning me

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:90%
to a UFO hunter guy?

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't know
anything about this stuff.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:10%
You know, [?COMNAVSURFLANT?]
sent me down here to work

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:90%
on satellites.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Now you're telling me I've
got to work with UFO people.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.432 align:middle line:90%
I said, man, what is going on?

00:14:54.432 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, calm down.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.848 align:middle line:90%
Just focus on the satellites.

00:14:56.848 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, that helps.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So I-- but he did say, do you
understand the word order?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, god.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm ordered to work
with this civilian.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So I go down the hall
with him, and we're

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:90%
walking down the hall.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:10%
And I asked Allen,
I said, did you

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:10%
notice that big globe sitting
in the office of the Commander?

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
He says, yes,
impressive, isn't it?

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, we're going to come
back and steal that tonight.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And Allen stopped, and he
looked at me, and he said,

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I've heard about you.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, god.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, apparently there must
be some truth to it because

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:90%
of what you're just saying.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not as larceny
as you think, Allen.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:10%
Just bear with me.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:10%
So we go in a motor pool that
night, get a pickup truck,

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:10%
throw a big old tire in the back
of the bed of the pickup truck.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:10%
We drive back to the
commander's office.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.640 align:middle line:10%
Guards are there.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I tell them, open the door.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm under orders.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:90%
I've got to work.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: [LAUGHS]
Oh my goodness.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They just opened
the doors, you know?

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:10%
So we walk in there,
and I get out.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.308 align:middle line:10%
I'm on the other
side of the globe.

00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:10%
And he said, pull
that big pin to you.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:10%
And we did.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.220 align:middle line:90%
And the thing goes, boom.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So that's where
they got the idea in "Close

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Encounters of the Third Kind,"
when they ran up in the--

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I didn't
know that at the time.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --and then dropped
off and made the big thump.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.438 align:middle line:90%
And they rolled it out.

00:16:15.438 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yes, this is
way before that movie.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:10%
And Allen calls me
later and tells me,

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:10%
hey, I put you in that
movie, "Close Encounters."

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm a consultant to a
guy named Spielberg.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And I went, you did what?

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:10%
You can't be telling
this kind of stuff.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:10%
He said, no, there's no names,
but you'll recognize it.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You did it.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
You're responsible
for the globe fall.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.363 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I guess so.

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
When we pulled the globe,
it's a big old thing.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.312 align:middle line:84%
We're rolling it
down the hallway.

00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at the glass.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:10%
And Allen starts laughing,
and I asked what.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.260 align:middle line:10%
He said, we look like Felix
the Cat with a big ball.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, man,
this guy is a hoot.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:10%
So we go out, roll
this big old globe out

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:10%
into the pickup truck, into the
tire, so it will stay steady.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
We drive over to the
shop I had set up.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:10%
And we started in on this globe.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:10%
And I take a drill.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
And I'm drilling really
small holes in this globe.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
And Allen's saying we're
going to be throwing the--

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Your commander's
going to kick your butt.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're going to
Leavenworth for this.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm a modeler.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:84%
I'll-- I'll patch
the holes, paint it.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You won't even know
I was ever there.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:90%
But I need to scale this globe.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.504 align:middle line:10%
Look at the scale.

00:17:22.504 --> 00:17:24.004 align:middle line:10%
And I told Allen,
measure the scale.

00:17:24.004 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:10%
And he's really good
at this kind of stuff.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:10%
Measure the scale.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:10%
Give me three sticks, you know,
to the scale, is what I wanted.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And we put in three
legs into each corner

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
of the Bermuda Triangle.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Then I took a soda straw and
glued it to the three legs.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I took a welder's
rod, a really long one.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.198 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: A long one,
all the way through.

00:17:43.198 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yes, and I went
down through the soda straw,

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:84%
so we have an apex point
over the Bermuda Triangle.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And right where it hit the
globe, I drilled a hole.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Sent a rod out through
the other side.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
We turned the globe over.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'm tapping it really hard.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And you see a little--

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.693 align:middle line:84%
I told Allen, feel for
a pucker in the globe.

00:18:02.693 --> 00:18:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, here's
another damaging hole,

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:90%
over here, that I'm making.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And I drill a little hole there,
and the rod comes through.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.085 align:middle line:84%
And Allen was the
first to notice.

00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm just trying
to get things set up.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And he stands there.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.560 align:middle line:90%
He breaks out his pipe.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Stroking his goatee.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
David, look where
that rod came out at.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:10%
It's in the center
of the Devil's Oval

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:10%
in the Sea of Japan.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's got the same
exact problems that we

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:90%
have in the Bermuda Triangle.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, look what you've done.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.985 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, I know.

00:18:33.985 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm poking holes in this globe.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
No, look, you--
the welder's rod,

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
it's through the
entire planet now,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.723 align:middle line:84%
and those two directly
line up with each other.

00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:45.765 align:middle line:84%
Well, Allen's jumping up
and down on all of this,

00:18:45.765 --> 00:18:47.012 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just--

00:18:47.012 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm worried about satellites.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.637 align:middle line:84%
I'm not worried
about, you know, I

00:18:49.637 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
want to get the globe done and
back in place before morning.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I get
the coordinates.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:10%
I picked up a phone, and
they patched me to NORAD.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling NORAD
about the satellites,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
giving them a
longitude and latitude.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Because what I have
now with welders

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
rod all the way through
the planet, way above here,

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.260 align:middle line:84%
over the Bermuda
Triangle, out in space,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I find the-- the very
point that the satellites

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.625 align:middle line:90%
hit that whatever it is.

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And then Allen
asked me, he said,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.083 align:middle line:90%
what do you think that is?

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, Allen, I'm
trying to fix satellites.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know, I'm a pilot.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, maybe it's a vortex.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It goes from planet to
planet, and they use

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.312 align:middle line:90%
it like we do for navigation.

00:19:31.312 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:84%
That's how they know
where to go on that planet

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.495 align:middle line:90%
when they get there.

00:19:34.495 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:10%
And Allen's sitting
there, going,

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:10%
that's a really good thought.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Work on that, Allen.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.213 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I call
in the coordinates.

00:19:42.213 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So when the satellites
come in, all they

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:84%
do is they just do a
little curve maneuver,

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and they go around this
energy beam or whatever it is.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's real.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.217 align:middle line:84%
And so the satellites
come around

00:19:54.217 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:90%
and go out the other side.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:10%
And I asked NORAD
how they're doing.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle line:10%
Perfect.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to
reprogram anything.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Problem solved.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Did the same thing when
we got to Sea of Japan.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:10%
Because they had to reprogram
it twice on every orbit.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.982 align:middle line:84%
And that became very
old, in doing it.

00:20:10.982 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The
satellites could still

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.043 align:middle line:84%
see into the Bermuda Triangle
from different angles

00:20:15.043 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.285 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:20:16.285 --> 00:20:17.827 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're
stereo tactically

00:20:17.827 --> 00:20:20.553 align:middle line:84%
placed in different areas
to get down in there.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: All they had to do
is change the angular momentum

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
of the platform in the
satellite to make adjustments

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:84%
for that little
bump we went around,

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and it worked just fine.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle line:90%
So I told Allen--

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:90%
we took all the rods out.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:90%
I patched the globe, painted it.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't even tell
we were ever there.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Drove the globe back to
the commander's office.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.346 align:middle line:84%
Put it back in the same--
put the pins back in it,

00:20:43.346 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:90%
and then we're done.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Allen was so relieved.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
He thought, we're not going
to go to Leavenworth now.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.067 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He never found out?

00:20:50.067 --> 00:20:50.867 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:52.373 align:middle line:84%
Commander never
knew we did a thing.

00:20:52.373 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, goodness.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And so I
said, well, that's it,

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Allen, I'm going home.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.018 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
working with me.

00:21:01.018 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I went, well, I solved
the satellite problem.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:90%
No, we've got a--

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
what is it you're
doing here, by the way?

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
What's your mission plan
or whatever you've got?

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And it was a contract.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And what it was, I guess
because of his experience

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
with Blue Book and the
contacts that he had.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.025 align:middle line:90%
He had very high level contacts.

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I
said, wait a minute.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They shut down
Project Blue Book,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
but you're now
here with the Navy,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:90%
searching underwater UFOs.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yeah.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:90%
I thought they shut it all down.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.290 align:middle line:90%
He says, yeah.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They've got you thinking
right, don't they?

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And I went, so
it's not shut down.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:90%
He says, no, still looking.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So the military's still
concerned about it.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there a
name for that program?

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
He-- it was, but he
had some kind of name,

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:90%
but I was never privy to it.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it was all on
a need to know basis.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was happy not knowing.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to get done.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:90%
But we went everywhere.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.967 align:middle line:10%
We went into the
swamps of Okefenokee.

00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Okefenokee.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.052 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: And we would
go out into the islands.

00:22:06.052 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were
you looking for?

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:90%
What were you studying there?

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, we were
following up on reports.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:84%
People said they'd seen things
moving in the waters and stuff.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And we talked to them.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:10%
And there was a very disturbing
pattern that would show up.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
That these people are--

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
some of them are so illiterate,
they can't even read and write.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But the things they
were telling us--

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way in God's
name, 2,000 miles between them,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:90%
they even knew each other.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling you
the exact same thing,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.650 align:middle line:90%
describing it to a T.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Which is?

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You know,
underwater discs,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
with a certain light
that would come and go.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Either they would
come in to the oceans,

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:84%
or they would move and
come out and I thought,

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:90%
this many people?

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have Cajuns tell
you that, you got Islanders

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:90%
telling you that.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you seen any
of the UFOs that they have?

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.333 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I didn't-- in all
the time we were there,

00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get to see
anything, except one time.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- it
was enough for me.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:10%
We came up on this island.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:10%
There was-- destroyers
were there, patrol boats.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:90%
This island is just blocked off.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.030 align:middle line:90%
All the way around.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you
can get near it.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.465 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Where's the island?

00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: It's in the Bermuda
Triangle area, but I can't--

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:10%
I can't-- lot of the
stuff is still classified.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:10%
But we came out to this island.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking, and I'm--

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:10%
and Hynek just starts
laughing, right?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:10%
And he's looking at me,
and he says, he said,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.630 align:middle line:10%
the look on your face is
worth this whole project.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is it?

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:84%
It-- you could see
like a Frisbee came in.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Skipped across the water.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Hits the beach.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.643 align:middle line:84%
Slides all the way
across the beach.

00:23:49.643 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Plows into these palm trees,
and it's sitting there.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a disk.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, what are
we going to do about this?

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:10%
And he said, we're
going to go look at it.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:10%
So we pull up to it.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm only about maybe
100, 200 feet away.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: And what year was this?

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:10%
I know it's--

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Early '70s.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm pulling the
bow of the boat up.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's more of a skiff.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And Allen jumps off.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And he walks over, and
he meets with a crew

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:90%
that's already there.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
There's ship's
company with the disk.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's guards around it.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:90%
You know, they take precautions.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So, Allen was gone
for several hours.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting a little bored.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's not
comfortable sitting

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:90%
on a small boat.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So I got off and
told my guy, I've

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
got to stretch my
legs on the sand.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So I tightened the
bow down, and I just

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:90%
get off and walk on the sand.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And I just meander over
toward where the saucer is.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's about 100
feet in diameter,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:84%
so they're on the
other side of it.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So I walk up onto the
edge of it and grab hold.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I just had to get
my hands on it.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.212 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What did it feel like?

00:24:56.212 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It was
solid, like steel.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's always hot
in the Caribbean.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Sun shining straight down on it.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, my boat's painted
white, but it's still

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:90%
warm to the touch.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:15.200 align:middle line:84%
This thing is actually cool to
the touch, in direct sunlight.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
how does it do that?

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.150 align:middle line:10%
And I hit it with my
fist a couple of times,

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.400 align:middle line:10%
see if I could get it to ring.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.692 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No reverb or anything.

00:25:22.692 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yes, which I'm sure
Alan and everybody would

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.293 align:middle line:90%
love that insight.

00:25:26.293 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So this is daytime.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:90%
You can actually see this.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:90%
This is in broad daylight.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:90%
it's right there.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It's and-- But you've got
Navy cruisers out there

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:90%
on the perimeter.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was the disk
just flat across,

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
or did it have that
classical hump in the middle?

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: No, there was
a hump in the middle.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.845 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What color was it?

00:25:43.845 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There was a hump
both at the top and bottom.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.417 align:middle line:84%
And they looked
like a sizable area.

00:25:50.417 --> 00:25:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was there damage?

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Did you see any
damage to the hull?

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I didn't
see any damage.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The thing looked like
it just slid into home.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Like you just run to a
base, and get your legs,

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and slide up to it.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he
mention an entrance

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:90%
to the inside of this vehicle?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There was
where they were.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Underneath, it was like a ramp.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:90%
You could walk up in it.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And ship's people who
were there, the cruisers,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:10%
apparently, they had
access to it for a while.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:10%
And when Allen came back,
he gets up on the boat.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:10%
And I'm up on the boat.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And we pulled the bow line
in, and we-- we leave.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.720 align:middle line:90%
We just turn around drive off.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there
any inhabitants?

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:90%
By the way he was--

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:84%
if he had met an alien
crew, I would know.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Allen couldn't-- he
couldn't hide that.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.963 align:middle line:84%
He would-- he was
never good at poker.

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:10%
He didn't know
what a poker face--

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: So did you ask him?

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.423 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: I didn't have to.

00:26:41.423 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:10%
He said-- he just looked at me.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at him.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:90%
He said, unoccupied.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:10%
But that, it's the
way he said it.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was more
disappointment or--

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:90%
it actually bothered him.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.063 align:middle line:10%
I think it bothered him because
they took the crew somewhere,

00:27:00.063 --> 00:27:02.480 align:middle line:10%
and he didn't care for that,
you know, separating the crew

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:10%
from the ship.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just learned
to leave it alone.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:84%
He sat down on the
bow of the boat

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
while I'm getting the
lines in and stuff.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing he
did was pull out his pipe

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and light it up, and he started
doing this with his goatee.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And he's staring.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.920 align:middle line:90%
He's doing this.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.942 align:middle line:84%
And I know something's
bothering him.

00:27:20.942 --> 00:27:22.525 align:middle line:84%
I've known him good
enough, where when

00:27:22.525 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:90%
he starts doing this--

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Something's irritating
him, what he saw out there.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Something irritating.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:90%
He's thinking about it.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's something he
saw he didn't care for.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the
crew was removed, maybe.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They probably removed
the crew before he got there.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And after I get
Allen and me on board,

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:90%
I pull the line in.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:84%
We turned the boat
around, and we swing out

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:90%
around a little point.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we did that, I could
see underneath it really well.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And there was a big hump there.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was a ramp
down from the craft.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting, because
you didn't see any seams

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:90%
or lines anywhere else.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering how
that ramp came down,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't close
enough to see.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's how they were
getting in and out of it.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.088 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
see the inside at all?

00:28:03.088 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No, nothing.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.400 align:middle line:90%
Other than it was not dark.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, like a-- the ramp
goes up into a dark void.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:84%
No, there was some
kind of light in there.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did the ramp
have a stairwell,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
or was it just more
of a flat ramp?

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It was a--

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:90%
it looked like it had ribs.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So they must have been
bipedal and anthropoid too,

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and they just slip
on a smooth ramp.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't
something we put on.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It was part of the
deck of the ramp.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But Allen's just
sitting there on the bow

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:84%
out there, bobbing up
and down, doing his pipe

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and smoking a
storm up out there.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Something was bothering him.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he ever
mention about us having

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:90%
the ability to shoot down UFOs?

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yes, we
talked about that.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:90%
He made a passing remark.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:10%
He said, you know,
it doesn't bode

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:10%
very well about
a group of people

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:10%
when you come to visit them,
the first thing they do,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.740 align:middle line:10%
you stick your foot outside
and draw back a stump.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we chewed it
off or ate it off.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.236 align:middle line:90%
And he said we're--

00:29:13.236 --> 00:29:15.650 align:middle line:84%
he just thought we
were very hostile

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.400 align:middle line:90%
as a race toward other species.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So Allen was always,
very cautious.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And he said if he ever meant
an alien race, first thing I

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.210 align:middle line:10%
would say to them,
be careful with us.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.415 align:middle line:90%
Don't turn your back on us.

00:29:31.415 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Apologize
ahead of time.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.957 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes, ahead of time.

00:29:33.957 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way Allen was.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:10%
And we never spoke
too much about it,

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:10%
but he knew that this
made a big impact on me.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the first real
hardware, nuts and bolts

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
thing that I ever saw in
the whole five months.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.858 align:middle line:10%
And it was-- that one day
was worth the whole thing.

00:29:50.858 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he ever tell you
anything about the Philadelphia

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Experiment?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: You know, we
had to talk about that.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And Allen and I had a
good talk about Tesla.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:10%
Because Tesla is really
the cause of what

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:10%
happened with Philadelphia.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:10%
They brought Tesla in.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:10%
And they wanted him
to phase shift a ship.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that
was for-- to block--

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, why can
you see me right now?

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting here in the studio.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.750 align:middle line:90%
The white lights are hitting me.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a solid mass.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm blocking the white light.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It outlines me, and
that's how you see me.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea is you've
got a ship on a horizon,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:90%
you can see that thing.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.138 align:middle line:84%
It looks like one of
those little rubber ducks,

00:30:35.138 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
bing, bing, it goes
back and forth.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Except when you
hit one of these,

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:10%
they just sink and
lose the whole crew.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Navy don't--

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
believe me, the Navy's
not happy with that.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.810 align:middle line:10%
So what the idea was is
phase shift the ship,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:10%
where it would no longer
block white light.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:10%
And if it does that,
it's disappeared,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:10%
but it's still sitting there.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.702 align:middle line:84%
And they can still be
on it, looking at you,

00:30:59.702 --> 00:31:00.660 align:middle line:90%
but you can't see them.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because it's
shifting in and out.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yes, it's
a phase shift.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And Tesla came up with
the idea that if you

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
wrap the ship in coils, he could
get the phase shift to occur,

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.035 align:middle line:84%
and the ship would
just disappear.

00:31:13.035 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, once he got
all the work done,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Tesla did, they threw Tesla out.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Which is, [LAUGHS] it's crazy.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.563 align:middle line:10%
And Allen agreed.

00:31:22.563 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:10%
You know, you don't throw away
the professor in the middle

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:10%
of the experiment.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And Tesla warned the Navy.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.940 align:middle line:10%
He said, if you don't get
your power settings right

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:10%
on this thing, it will get away
and get out control real fast.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.890 align:middle line:10%
And Tesla said,
you'll hit an area

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:10%
that you know nothing about,
and that would be time travel.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew in this
experiment what

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
they were doing once
you threw Tesla away.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Navy fires it up.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:90%
And as always, instead of--

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.332 align:middle line:90%
crank it up to the max, boys.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Throw down the switch.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They do.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.350 align:middle line:90%
And they crank it up.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:10%
And the ship phased
out of sight.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It sure did.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It did more than
phase out of sight.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:90%
It phased out, gone.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And it went-- apparently, it got
thrown into a time warp or loop

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.950 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you call the thing.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:22.075 align:middle line:84%
But the thing appeared, and
they were doing this way back.

00:32:22.075 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:90%
I think in 1940.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:10%
The thing showed up
in 1985, in a harbor.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And they-- and there was
even a picture taken of it.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it showed up
at different places,

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:90%
different times.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And Tesla said there's other
dangers with this stuff.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.450 align:middle line:84%
When things are phasing,
the molecular structure

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.080 align:middle line:90%
will get soft, not so rigid.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.220 align:middle line:90%
And then when a--

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:84%
the ship showed up again, they
found some of the crew people,

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
they were embedded in the
floor and in the walls.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
were still alive.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:90%
God knows what that felt like.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But the Navy didn't
listen to him.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:84%
They should have
listened to the boy.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.077 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So this
phasing, you would say,

00:33:01.077 --> 00:33:02.770 align:middle line:90%
is part of time travel.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:11.310 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Yeah because, somehow
Tesla, he was onto time travel,

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:10%
but he really didn't--

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the experiments
didn't have the big time travel

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:10%
stuff in it.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.410 align:middle line:84%
He said it was so
unstable to work with.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:90%
What it was, was--

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Tesla was really smart.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.842 align:middle line:10%
He knew that we were
operating outside our--

00:33:28.842 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Our realm of
knowledge of the science?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.080 align:middle line:90%
We were outside the envelope.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.372 align:middle line:90%
We were going to have problems.

00:33:34.372 --> 00:33:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And boy, they had nothing but
problems with the Philadelphia

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Experiment.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.857 align:middle line:10%
Ultimately, it just
kind of faded away,

00:33:40.857 --> 00:33:43.190 align:middle line:10%
and everybody let go of it,
because it's out of control.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:10%
Just what he said would happen.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:47.750 align:middle line:90%
And Hynek understood all--

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:84%
he got all this stuff,
even better than I did.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:84%
He said that the UFOs
would do the same thing.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:90%
That they would phase.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.523 align:middle line:84%
And he said, people
say they blink out.

00:34:00.523 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're actually
moving through dimensions.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said that the two
were tied at the hip.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And you know what would
have been so cool?

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
I would have loved to
have been in a room

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:18.020 align:middle line:90%
with Hynek and Tesla talking.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.380 align:middle line:10%
Man, I would have ran a recorder
on that group of those two.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:10%
Because there would have
been some interesting stuff,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:10%
because they were way
smarter than I was.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But if people think this stuff
is made up, and none of it

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:84%
ever existed, I'm here to
tell you, that's not so.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Stuff is real.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people think
that these disks and things

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:90%
are time travel devices.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
think about that?

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Possible?

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, they
have to be, right?

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:84%
And just looking at
that disk on the beach,

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:84%
this thing was built
somewhere else.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.949 align:middle line:84%
And NASA, it was way
beyond their technology.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:84%
This thing was way outside
our technological envelope,

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.380 align:middle line:90%
the way it was manufactured.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Another thing, not a seam,
not a weld line, nothing.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Seamless.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Top and bottom.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.388 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:35:08.388 --> 00:35:09.555 align:middle line:90%
And this was the early '70s.

00:35:09.555 --> 00:35:10.972 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have
anything like that.

00:35:10.972 --> 00:35:13.263 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, thank you,
Dave, for coming on the show.

00:35:13.263 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazing
story you have.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Glad to be here.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.450 align:middle line:90%
