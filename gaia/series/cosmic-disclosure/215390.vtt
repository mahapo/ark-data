00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we're with Sébastien Martin,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
a retired chairman of the board
of a multinational business who

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:10%
has participated in covert
remote viewing assignments

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
for a CIA analyst.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking
about an ancient stargate

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:90%
found in the Middle East.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Sébastien, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you, Emery
for having me on the show.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell us a little bit about
yourself and tell us a little

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:84%
bit about your connection
with this CIA officer.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I came from France
originally then moved to Canada.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was the owner of a
business that I started in 2005.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I sold that
business in 2014.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I remained chairman of the
board for two years after that

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and then resigned to talk
about my experiences.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, I started having
visions, very vivid visions

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:90%
of random events.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Could be like an airplane crash.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
It could have been just like
tsunamis, earthquakes, very

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:84%
strong feelings that I could
feel I was living those events.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that created a
lot of anxiety in my life

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I could see my daughter at
the age of 20 years old.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, very random events.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But there was one event in
particular that really changed

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:84%
my life, which I didn't
know at the time,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was about a man who
died in a car explosion.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know where this
explosion happened or occurred.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who the
man was at the time.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But all I could hear while
having this vision was "prime

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:90%
minister assassinated."

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I could see the man's
face because he rolled up

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:90%
his window, rolled it down.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I could see his face,
I could see his mustache.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the next day, I
decided to go on Google Images

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.015 align:middle line:84%
and search for "prime
minister assassinated"

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
or the key words that
I heard in my vision.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And the name popped
up as Rafic Hariri.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:10%
I could recognize his
face on the images.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And the man died seven
years prior to my vision,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
so I was thinking,
why am I seeing this?

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Then we switched on
the news, and I just

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
realized that there was
a trial at the Hague

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
about the potential
assassins of Rafic Hariri.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And so those men were called,
and it was going on for years.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But at that point in time,
it must have been specific,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
but still, I didn't really
know why I was seeing it.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And so life went on.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:90%
So that was in 2009.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2016,
that's when I decided

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
to talk about my
experiences in general.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I had encounters,
I had more visions,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
so I decided to share more of
this on radio shows and so on.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point, I had
more contacts from Facebook.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people were
contacting me on Facebook.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:90%
And I was not being selective.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:10%
I just randomly
accepted anybody who

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:10%
was trying to befriend
me at the time.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I basically had
a vision, another vision

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
about this woman who was
in the back of a car,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and she was living a very
crowded place in a city.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people were
walking on the street,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and there were three men that
were walking against the crowd.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So the car was moving
this way, the men

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
were walking on the
left-hand side this way.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.566 align:middle line:84%
So I could see this scene
very clearly, all the details,

00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:84%
what they were wearing, the type
of clothes they were wearing.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was observing this
scene through the eyes

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of this woman who was hiding
in the back seat of this car.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And funny enough,
out of all the people

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
who befriend me on Facebook
and I had on my page,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I knew who that person was.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to contact her and
send her a message on Messenger

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
saying, "I know who you are,
and your life is in danger."

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what I sent.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:90%
And explained what I saw.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't hear back
for four weeks, I guess.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And four weeks later,
I received one message.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And that message was, "Is
that the man that you saw."

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Yes, but he was
wearing different clothes."

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And so she thought
it was interesting.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And then she started sending
me articles, newspaper articles

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:90%
of random events.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Can you
tell me about this?

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what
you see through this."

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And I was reading the articles.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And as I was reading
the articles,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I could see what
truly happened, which

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.600 align:middle line:84%
was not what was
written on the articles.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So I explained, I said, "Well,
these two women were pushed off

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:90%
that building."

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a building
in construction

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and the article mentioned they
committed suicide, both of them,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
two sisters jumping
off the rooftop.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "No, they were
pushed by two soldiers.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.115 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, the
two soldiers left the building,

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
one left from the
back of the building,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and the other one left from
the front of the building."

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And she replied saying, "Well,
we knew about one soldier,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:90%
but not two."

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So she already knew
the actual events.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's how she
was testing me.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And slowly but surely, she
was explaining that what I was

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
seeing was more to do
with remote viewing.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
the term until then.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I never got
trained to do what I do.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It just happens naturally.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I see like mini
movies of events.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:90%
I can hear.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I can sometimes smell.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:90%
But I don't see fixed images.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like usually mini
movies of the time and also,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.325 align:middle line:84%
usually, through the
eyes of someone else.

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Sébastien, how
did you get so involved?

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you did write a
message to this CIA officer

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:10%
and then she responded,
started engaging.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Where did that lead to?

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very interesting.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I was not supposed to
be knowing any of this.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it came
kind of a surprise.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
She explained that she was
asked to follow me on Facebook

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and to find out why I was
talking about Rafic Hariri

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and why I knew about this detail
of him winding down his window.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if he didn't, he
would have been saved.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So the car was bullet-proof
and bomb-proof.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So he would have survived
the blast if he did not

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:90%
roll down his window.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And the events that I did not
mention was that he was killed,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time,
he was also observed.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was seeing the event
through the eyes of someone

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
else who was based on the
rooftop of another building,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:90%
looking at him through a scope.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So I knew this was
very well organized,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's another
particular event that

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.532 align:middle line:84%
triggered them to follow
me and find out who I was

00:07:41.532 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and to become a
person of interest.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And what happened after?

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So in 2017, after like a full
year of events and doing remote

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
viewing, saving
that agent's life,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I basically got more and
more privy to certain details

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
of missions that
person was involved in.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I was asked to
remote-view some of the agents

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
or people they were
hiring or trying

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to hire for certain
missions and see

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:84%
what I could see from them
that they didn't know about

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
or that they should know about.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
I started getting

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
paid for those kind of roles.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, not being
privy to any of it.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Like I was not asked to be
fully involved in those missions

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:84%
or know the details or the
code names of those missions.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't even
asking for it either.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.333 align:middle line:84%
I was keeping it private and
just sticking to the tasks.

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
much what I was doing.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>> At what point were you asked
to remote-view this stargate?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
interesting question.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I was actually still doing
those kind of random missions.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And out of the blue, this person
said, back in the second Gulf

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.755 align:middle line:90%
War, she was in Iraq.

00:08:59.755 --> 00:09:00.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And she saw many troops
from different countries.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And she also was privy to
the removal of the stargate.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So she saw the
stargate being removed

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:84%
from the underground
location of the summer

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:90%
palace of Saddam Hussein.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, they knew
about the stargate's location.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein himself
knew about the stargate.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And he knew about the people
working with the stargate.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's another story.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But when the stargate
got removed from Iraq,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
this agent was involved in
the shipment of that stargate

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:90%
at the summer palace.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So she was working
with the Americans.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:90%
She was working with--

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the Bulgarians
were even there too.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So there were multiple nations
that-- were also Italians there.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:90%
French were there too.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they sent off
the stargate in a crate,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to
make it leave the country

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:90%
and then it got out of hands.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:90%
And the stargate got stolen.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And they lost it.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:90%
They lost track of it.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't part of that program.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.655 align:middle line:84%
She just knew that the
stargate got stolen.

00:10:11.655 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
an inside job.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
someone else from the CIA

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that worked for
another organization.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And then that's
how it disappeared.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, they
tracked it down to Bulgaria.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't know where
in Bulgaria it was located.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
What I was told was that the
stargate was comprised or made

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
of stones that came
from the Earth's core.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was extracted
by the Anunnaki.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it was hard for me
to comprehend and understand

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But she explained
that the stargate was

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
made of these very rare metal,
black stone with inscriptions

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
on it and that for some reason,
some pieces of the stargate

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
got removed before the
stargate got moved to Bulgaria.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And I do not know why,
I didn't know who,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
or anything about
that at the time.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you see?

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> At first, I was asked to
remote view the stargate,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and I did.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at the
stargate, when I saw it,

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I was in direct contact with it.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I could see it right
in front of me.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I also saw a white draco
reptilian with the stargate.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And behind him were
soldiers in black uniforms.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was no insignia,
there was no names, nothing.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:90%
And they were just there.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I could not really
picture the room itself.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It looked pretty white
in the background.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But the stargate was there and
it was standalone on a stand.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:84%
It was not connected
to anything.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It was just a random
piece of technology

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that was not being used because
they could not make it function.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think when
you had that vision,

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.818 align:middle line:84%
was that like current or
was that from the past,

00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:90%
or is that in the future?

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That was current.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Current?

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
It was live. like
i was seeing it.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> You're seeing it live with
the reptilian and the guys

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.407 align:middle line:90%
in the tactical suits.

00:11:59.407 --> 00:12:00.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's correct.

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What else can you
tell me more about the--

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>> layout there.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So I did mention that I was
usually seeing events through

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:90%
someone else's eyes.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
In this case, that
was not the case.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I was directly connecting
to the stargates as myself.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So I was there,
like my soul energy,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.135 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call it,
my consciousness was there.

00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:21.935 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:22.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Bilocating.

00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Bilocating, yes.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.835 align:middle line:84%
And the reptilian was
looking straight at me.

00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, literally
facing him, like right opposite

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:90%
him.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's
how he saw me.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And he looks--

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't directly actually
facing him, just maybe

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:90%
slightly on his right.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
So while he was looking
straight at the time,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
then you moved his head slightly
towards me to look at me.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.793 align:middle line:84%
That's when I knew it
was a direct eye contact.

00:12:51.793 --> 00:12:53.585 align:middle line:84%
>> That made you feel
really uncomfortable.

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it scared me.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
It scared me.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And I felt threatened.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I stopped
the communication.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first time
ever that it happened to me.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:90%
This was new to me.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.125 align:middle line:84%
So that day, I basically
just went to bed.

00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up in
the middle of the night

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and I had a nosebleed and
I had a pounding headache.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.575 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that my whole
body was vibrating and not

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
in a good way, like
I was not feeling--

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> He was attacking you.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> He was attacking me,
and I was not feeling good.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Psionics.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know
what to do with this.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:84%
This was the first time ever
that something like this

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:90%
happened to me.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I heard it before
from other people,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and I never understood
how could this

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
happened because I
never experienced it

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.093 align:middle line:90%
until at that time.

00:13:41.093 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's a real pickle.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So I went downstairs
and set down on my sofa

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and I started to meditate.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So I basically closed my eyes
and I could see my Kundalini

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.970 align:middle line:90%
energy going counterclockwise.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I knew something
was really way off.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was not feeling good.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided to try
to stop the flow of energy

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and to slow it down
or try to make myself

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:90%
heal, if that makes sense.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> But it was not working.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
It was not working.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was also in communications
with other remote viewers

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
that I was working with.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were also
involved in the program,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and they were also being
attacked at the same time.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
about the psychic attack

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:84%
is while I was trying to heal
myself and calm myself down,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to heal
myself for four hours straight

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and nothing worked.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And at the end,
for some reason, I

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
don't know exactly
how and why, I

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
was able to open up a
connection between me

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and that draco reptilian.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I could see myself going
through this white tunnel.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was hovering,
like my vision,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%
I could see the top of his head.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So I could see the
protuberance in full form.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And at that point
in time, I felt

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:84%
like I could just cast some
kind of white light of energy

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:90%
to stop the psychic attack.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And that worked right away.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how, why.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I just knew intuitively
how to do this.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.495 align:middle line:84%
And so that stopped
the psychic attack.

00:15:25.495 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So what did you learn about
the stargate after all this?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I knew that the
stargate was definitely made out

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
of a piece of metal or
stone-like substance that was

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:90%
not--

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to me, it felt like it
was not from this earth,

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:84%
but it was from the
main core of the Earth.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Inner Earth, right?

00:15:44.215 --> 00:15:45.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:45.015 --> 00:15:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of technology was
what I've seen with my own eyes,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:90%
actually using remote viewing.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying with
other pieces of technology

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But this one in
particular was definitely

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
of a different type of substance
because I could feel its energy.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know where
the stargate takes you?

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it was definitely--

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- the stargate itself
was used by the Anunnaki

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
for traveling between
their planets or space

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:30.815 align:middle line:84%
to Iraq and to communicate with
some secret space program agents

00:16:30.815 --> 00:16:31.615 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they say this stargate
is active and they can turn it

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
on whenever they want or--

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.610 align:middle line:90%
who's in control of it?

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So the stargate was
originally used by the secret

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
space program underground of
that summer palace in Iraq.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So in the ancient
Babylon location,

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein knew
about the SSP personnel

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:90%
were Iraqi scientists.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was told to
leave them alone.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And as a dictator of his
country, it's hard for anybody

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to imagine that he was told
not to mingle with those people

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:90%
and to leave them alone.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
And they were
completely separate,

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:84%
independent from Iraq,
from Saddam Hussein,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the world.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And he had to respect
it, which he did.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
He built a tunnel
from his summer palace

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:84%
to go directly down
to the stargate.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:10%
And the location of the
stargate on the ground

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:10%
was pretty much
like the Derinkuyu

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:10%
in Turkey, like those kind of
labyrinth with the stone pillars

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:10%
to allow people to roam through
the space with lots of water.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:10%
>> What does it look like?

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Is it round?

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it square?

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It was round.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It was round, hollow,
maybe like nine feet tall.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Maybe nine, 10 feet tall by--

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
like 9 by 9, I
guess, I would say.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's not too big.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Not too big.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And the beings
coming through it,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.167 align:middle line:90%
the Anunnaki beings, I never--

00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> How'd they fit through there?

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.165 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty big.

00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:09.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:11.395 align:middle line:90%
Well, those ones could fit in.

00:18:11.395 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:90%
They were going through it.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
to the SSP people.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is stories I heard.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I never remote-viewed
that particular event.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But I was told that
this is what happened,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that basically those
Anunnaki beings came through,

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:90%
two brothers.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And they had baritone voices,
pretty scary looking people,

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
apparently, from what I heard.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And that the SSP scientists were
able to communicate with them.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.605 align:middle line:84%
To what degree or what
extent, I have no idea.

00:18:47.605 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that they
were in communication

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:90%
with those Anunnaki beings.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein was also told
that he could communicate

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and learn from these
Anunnaki beings,

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.597 align:middle line:84%
but he considered it to be
like dark magic and satanic--

00:19:02.597 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So he didn't want
anything to do with it.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> --in essence.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So no, he got scared
from it and he

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to mingle
with those beings,

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
so he kind of left them alone.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But the water is very
important for the stargate

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
to be functional.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.603 align:middle line:84%
So without the water, the
stargate would not work.

00:19:19.603 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Like an activator
or something.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, you mentioned
the SSP is there.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
SSP, that can mean

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different definitions
here in the United States.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%
So who is in charge of this SSP?

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And how does that all fit
in together with this?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, those
scientists were Iraqi.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:90%
They were not Americans.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
structure of the SSP,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:84%
how many nations are part
of it or work within it.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
those SSP scientists

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
were involved in the extraction
of some of these components

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:90%
from the stargates.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:84%
When the stargate was
removed from Iraq,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
they removed certain components
of it to make it unfunctional--

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Unfunctional.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --so they could not--

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:90%
they could not--

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What were those components?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was tasked to
search for those components.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
remote-view a location

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:90%
in Africa, Eastern Africa.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:90%
And US troops went there.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:90%
It was in the news.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't say
for what reason.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:84%
They just say that they were
there to protect the people

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.505 align:middle line:84%
But they were actually searching
for those missing components.

00:20:32.505 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I've never been told
if they found them

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:90%
or not, but all I know is that--

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was accurate
in my description.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.355 align:middle line:84%
But I never got the
confirmation that--

00:20:45.355 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not
going to tell you.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess that was too
much for me to know about.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the
stargate in Bulgaria,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw the location of
those missing components.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that
there was one piece

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
on the left and one piece
on the right that were

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:90%
gone from the actual stargate.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And how they got
removed, I have no idea.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But I knew the size of
them and everything else.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So what I was told later on
is that the while the stargate

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:84%
in Bulgaria was no longer in
the hands of the Americans,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the missing
components, as to why

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to
search for them, I

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:84%
think it's because
they want me to be

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
there first before the people
in charge of the stargates

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.640 align:middle line:84%
could get hold of those
and get their hands

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:84%
on those pieces
or missing pieces

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:90%
so they could make it work.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:90%
That's my feedback on that.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know exactly
who was involved,

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:90%
like who was what, what was--

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea about the--

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:90%
So how do it was the Anunnaki?

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And what's that connection
with the dracos?

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So the Anunnaki and the dracos,
I kind of researched it as well,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:84%
thinking like people can
see them together and so on.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I personally didn't see them
working with one another.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I saw those beings
completely independently

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
from the dracos coming
through the stargate.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That was not part of the draco
reptilian race or working

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.112 align:middle line:84%
with that specific group who
moved the stargate to Bulgaria.

00:22:29.112 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being is because
as soon as the stargate got

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
pulled out of the
underground location,

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki stopped
going through it

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.230 align:middle line:84%
or stopped going
through that vortex,

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
literally, because
without this structure,

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.778 align:middle line:84%
they could no longer
use that space

00:22:44.778 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
the people there.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists left,
and they went into hiding.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And four out of five
scientists got killed.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Only one left?

00:22:54.835 --> 00:22:56.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Only one left.

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that story--

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking about
the Iraqi scientist?

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that story from
that surviving scientist.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know who killed them?

00:23:06.035 --> 00:23:06.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:06.835 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Who killed them?

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Kruger organization
is an organization that started

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:90%
in Germany back in the '30s.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And they got involved
way back when

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
in terms of reverse
engineering for UFO crafts

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that crashed in Eastern
Europe or Russia.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were in charge
of reverse engineering

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:90%
of those crafts.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.000 align:middle line:10%
Wernher von Braun
was also part of it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:10%
So through the
Operation Paperclip,

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:10%
when he got moved
to the US, along

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:10%
with other thousands of
scientists and technicians

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:10%
and so on, he's
the one who talked

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:10%
to the Pentagon and the people
in charge about the Kruger

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:10%
Organization.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't find
out who these people

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:90%
were, where they were located.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And the SSP got created
from that 10 years later.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
They also reverse
engineered crafts

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:90%
in America and other countries.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they worked with
different scientists

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.505 align:middle line:84%
And they work with different
agencies, like through the Five

00:24:08.505 --> 00:24:10.625 align:middle line:84%
Eye Organization,
these kind of things.

00:24:10.625 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the relationships
between the SSP and Kruger,

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.455 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials?

00:24:18.455 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So obviously, through
the downed crafts,

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
the SSP personnel got involved
with some gray aliens,

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
they got involved
with different races,

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
they were able to communicate
with those beings too.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Kruger had the same advantage
for talking to different races

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:90%
too, including the dracos.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So they each had
their different races

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
to help them out through
their organizations.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they very quickly
realized both of them

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:84%
that they were not
in charge themselves,

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that they were mostly
working for them

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
or towards their agenda,
not for the human agenda.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is this
agenda you mention?

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't really know
the agenda per se.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I just know that they have
their own goals, I guess.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
On the Kruger side, for what I
know, and especially the draco

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
side, is that they want
full control of the Earth.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:84%
They want to not just
control the Earth.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.240 align:middle line:84%
They want to kind take
control of humanity

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.820 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
laboratory for them,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
a space of observation and
experimentation as well.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a location that they
can easily navigate through

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and be happy about.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
They have destroyed other
planets, other worlds.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is a place
where they can easily

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.117 align:middle line:84%
invade without declaring war
on humanity, for example.

00:25:59.117 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
They can just simply
control humanity.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a controlling
body above Kruger and SSP?

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe there are.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:90%
The SSP is highly organized.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they have people in
power that they respond to,

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
but it's way above the
president in America.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It's way above any
leaders in Europe.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.345 align:middle line:84%
So those people are working
independently from one another.

00:26:27.345 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly what they
can access in terms of funds,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:84%
but all I know is that they
don't rely on any governments

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.846 align:middle line:90%
to fund their organization.

00:26:43.846 --> 00:26:46.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Kruger and
SSP in competition,

00:26:46.107 --> 00:26:48.065 align:middle line:84%
or are they just doing
their separate projects?

00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> They are doing their
separate projects.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But because of the reverse
engineering of technology,

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
they obviously want
to spy on one another

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
or try to get information
that each other have.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it's hard
to know exactly--

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I think the stargate is
a prime example of that.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the extraction
of the stargate was happening,

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and then Kruger got involved
and then took the stargate away.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not privy to any
other technologies

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.445 align:middle line:84%
that Kruger got involved,
but I know that that's

00:27:23.445 --> 00:27:24.695 align:middle line:90%
what's happening all the time.

00:27:24.695 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see any great things
coming out of this as far

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.205 align:middle line:84%
as the technology maybe at some
point being released to help

00:27:31.205 --> 00:27:32.005 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:27:32.005 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't see that happening.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
For some reason,
those organizations

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:90%
have a different agenda.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:45.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't really try to modify
or change our current timeline

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why I'm here today

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
as well is because I was asked
to come to talk about this.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
important for the people

00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to know that there will be some
changes that will slowly occur.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I think the orbs and the drones
that we've seen in the US

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:90%
and abroad is part of that.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe that
the SSP is generating those.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:10%
I think it's to do with
the Kruger organization.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:84%
What I'm more worrying
about is that the orbs

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:84%
as part of the
drones that people

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:84%
have seen that could be
six feet in diameter,

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
could basically change and have
an impact on infrastructure,

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:84%
even like nuclear plants,
which happened in the past.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
disable nuclear plants.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
technology that they have.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that could be a threat
to the US infrastructures.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
it has not happened.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.525 align:middle line:84%
I think it was more
kind of a warning.

00:28:58.525 --> 00:29:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So why are you
sharing your story today.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.775 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think the
positive outcome may be, if any?

00:29:04.775 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I was asked to come forward
to talk about this because this

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is part of the disclosure
situation where people need

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:90%
to know what's going on.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, that new
technologies will come forward

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and that we'll have
to embrace and accept.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
in 2025, humanity

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:84%
will be faced with
positive changes coming

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:84%
from the reverse engineering
aspect from the ETs.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be very
smooth and very gentle

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:90%
in terms of disclosure.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I think they're going to be
saying, we have access to this

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be part
of our day-to-day lives.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be
learning about this.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's going to be a
positive change for us to start

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.020 align:middle line:84%
learning about different
aspects of the ET world

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and what we can do
with it moving forward.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds wonderful.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.883 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was, Sébastien,
compelling, amazing information.

00:30:03.883 --> 00:30:05.675 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for coming on the show.

00:30:05.675 --> 00:30:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.247 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for having me again.

00:30:08.247 --> 00:30:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:90%
