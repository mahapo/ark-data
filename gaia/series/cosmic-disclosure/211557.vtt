>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Today we're talking
about a missing submarine

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:90%
that appeared after 20 years.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.317 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

Good to be here.

>> Well, how did the US
Navy submarine disappear

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.367 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica in 1959?

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1959, the United
States Navy had some--

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:84%
just a few--
nuclear-powered submarines.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of them was
this particular one.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Although the United
States Navy had

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
a name for this
particular submarine,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:84%
ironically, after
it disappeared,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:90%
they changed the name.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So it was just
classified as Submarine X

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%
during the time it was missing.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, what was
the actual name?

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the USS Baseline
was the name that came out

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
of the facility in
Groton, Connecticut,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:90%
that built the submarine.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:10%
It was part of the same class
as the Thresher and a Scorpion.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:10%
They were new
nuclear-powered submarines.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And this one went to
Antarctica to conduct

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
some tests of its nuclear power
plant and some water and ice

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
sampling, and mediocre
tests like that.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:90%
But in 1959, it disappeared.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
All communications with
this submarine ceased.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way the submarine
back in those days

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
we're able to
communicate, they would

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:84%
have to come up near the
surface and put out an antenna--

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
high-frequency antenna--

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:90%
and they could send out signals.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they communicated
with their closest base, which

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe at that time
was in South America.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Anyways, the South
American communication site--

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
naval communication site that
was relaying signals to naval

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:84%
headquarters lost contact
with the Baseline.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, they sent
ships, other ships,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
down there-- destroyers and
surface ships, not submarines.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't find it.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
They searched and
searched and searched.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was close
to Antarctica,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and they thought maybe there was
some anomaly around Antarctica

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that was keeping the ships from
being able to use sonar deep

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:90%
under the Antarctic ice.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:84%
They based that on
some other problems

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
they had down there
earlier in the 1950s

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:90%
with anomalies that occurring.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.275 align:middle line:84%
Radar sightings that
were ghost sightings,

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:90%
they would call them.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Aircrafts flying into
Antarctica that saw things that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
were there one moment
and gone the next moment.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of anomalies, Rick?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.595 align:middle line:84%
>> These were unidentified
flying objects, UFOs,

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And there were so many
different cases in the late

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
'40s and the early '50s
right when we were trying

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:90%
to establish bases down there--

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
McMurdo, and some
other bases, US.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And not just us, not just the
United States, but other world

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
powers was trying to establish
bases in Antarctica because we

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
knew, as the Russians and
the Chinese and the French

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and the British knew, it would
be a very important place

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to establish bases
in the future.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Why was it so important to
establish bases in the future

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we the United States
figure it was as a place

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:90%
to launch something.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Maybe missiles.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe placing missile sites down
there, either ICBMs or others.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
It was a unique location even
though it was cold and frozen.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
It was a unique location
to monitor everything

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:84%
around the world
from one location.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Rather than having to have
different communication

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
sites or military
bases, we could

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
launch things or do things
down in Antarctica somewhat

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:90%
secretly.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, since this was
a new class of submarine,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
nuclear powered, why did
they pick Antarctica to do

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.597 align:middle line:90%
the testing?

00:04:42.597 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a question I
asked the admiral that

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:90%
was telling me this story.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
the best place

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to test a submarine
in cold climate

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
would be Antarctica
or the North Pole.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
used Antarctica.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And besides, in 1957,
the United States Navy

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
established a base
in Antarctica.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a base there
that they could operate out of.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, during this
time particular time period

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that the Baseline
was down there,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't access the
base because of the ice.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Something about the ice.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have any more
details about why they

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
couldn't.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So for the 20 years the
Baseline's been missing,

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:90%
what were they doing?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> After a few months of
searching for the Baseline,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:90%
they gave up.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there has to be
some time they pull the cord

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and say, we're just
not going to find it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a lot of deep
water submersible technology

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
back in those days where we
could place some kind of rescue

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:90%
submarine that deep.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and we're talking
15,000 to 17,000 feet deep.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have anything
that could go down

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:90%
there except for sonar.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And we did have submarines
that could go down and search,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't go down
all the way to the bottom

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:90%
or they would implode.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So they figured by that
time that this submarine

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
had imploded, and it
was on the ocean floor.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing that
they could do, nor could they

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
recover it, during
that time period

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have
anything to recover it with.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:90%
They did contract--

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was a
French company that

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
was a salvage company that could
place weights and things down

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:84%
deep and to scrape
along the ocean floor

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
to try to bring up something.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.448 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe they
ever found anything.

00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>> They didn't even know
where they were looking.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Or did they get one last
transmission, and that's

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:90%
where they based it off of?

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't exactly
know how they did this,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and the admiral didn't
fully explain to me.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:10%
But there was a
last known position,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:10%
and that's where they
started their search.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:10%
And just like when the
Thresher went down,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:10%
or the Scorpion went down--

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:10%
two Navy submarines
that were lost--

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:10%
the same thing,
the last position.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
where they started.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, we jump ahead to 1979.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Now in 1979, the
United States Navy

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:84%
was conducting some very
highly classified projects down

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
in the Southern Indian Ocean.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Heard Island is about 500 or
600 miles north of Antarctica.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:90%
It's an uninhabited island.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's several different
smaller islands down there.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The uniqueness
about Heard Island

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is there's one particular
species of penguins

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that live on that
island, and that's

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:84%
the only place in
the world that they

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
live, is just on Heard Island.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And so there's scientists
would go down there

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and conduct experiments
trying to figure out

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
why these penguins only
inhabited that island.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:10%
But anyways, during
this exploration,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:10%
one of the ships that took some
of these scientists down there

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:10%
to the island-- they would
spend a few weeks down there--

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:10%
they saw something in the
water south of Heard Island.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.823 align:middle line:84%
It was similar-- they thought
it was the top of a submarine.

00:08:23.823 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't
think much of it

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
because they thought, well,
there's other countries that

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:90%
operate around here.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
Not many because that
part of the Indian Ocean

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:34.550 align:middle line:90%
is there's no--

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's open.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:90%
Open space.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:10%
>> --cargo traffic,
ship traffic.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just open.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of military use that
for testing because there's

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
no other ships down there.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, when
the ship came back

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to pick up the scientists,
one of the scientists

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
reported to the
captain of the ship,

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
there's something down there
that we've been watching,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of
moving back and forth.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So the captain immediately
checked it out,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and he said, that's
the top of a submarine.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
submarine in the area.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So as they took these
scientists back to Australia,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:84%
where they were based out
of, the captain of that ship

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
notified the Australian Navy,
there's a submarine down

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:90%
at Heard Island.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So they said, there can't
be a submarine down there.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they thought,
well, after World War II,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
we scuttled a lot of old
ships down in that area,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and maybe one just came back up.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So a few months later, a
United States Navy ship was

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
conducting classified
operations down there,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and they decided to go over
to check out the submarine,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
which had partially surfaced
on a barrier under--

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
shallow barrier.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:84%
They recorded the
tail number of it,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
which basically
no longer existed

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:90%
in a Navy database, Baseline.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:90%
So that sent up a lot of flags.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
This ship disappeared 1959,
and you found it in 1979?

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So initially, the
commander of that ship,

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
which is not a submarine-- it
was a ship, a surface ship--

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:90%
was told not to board it.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have to--

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Clear it, yeah.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to have to get
it off that barrier and tow it.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to tow it back.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to tow
all the way back to Hawaii

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:84%
before they open the
hatches because they

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:90%
figured everybody's dead.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.905 align:middle line:84%
Nothing but bodies
or bones inside.

00:10:42.905 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's been 20 years.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, they brought
other ships down there,

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:90%
salvage ships.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And they got it off the
Barrier Reef or whatever,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:10%
and they towed it all the
way back to Pearl Harbor.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> They didn't investigate
the hull or say, hey,

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
there's some cracks, or an
explosion, or missile attack,

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
or torpedo attack?

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> They didn't inspect it,
to the best of my knowledge,

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
the admiral telling
me this story,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
until they got it
back to Pearl Harbor.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, they found no damage
on the outside whatsoever.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Not one scratch.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:10%
Nothing was damaged
on the outside.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that it hadn't been
dropped to an unspecified depth

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
because it would
have been imploded

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:90%
and would have been damaged.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Hadn't struck
anything because there

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:90%
was no damage on the outside.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:10%
So after three days, he decided,
OK, they're going to open it.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And they did it in a certain
way, the standard procedure.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And they had to vent
everything first.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So they opened it and
they vented everything.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, they call
it a casualty recovery

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
team, which I know you
were on at one time,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:90%
would go inside and search.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was
not one single body.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Where'd the body go?

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Where'd the bodies go?

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe the admiral
told me there were 69 crew

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:90%
members in this submarine.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
There should have
been 69 members.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I think there were
65 United States Navy

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:84%
personnel, and four civilians
from the company that

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:90%
built the submarine.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think they were
also the ones that

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
handled the nuclear reactor.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the investigation bring
up anything such as, number

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:90%
one, does the reactor--

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is it stable, does
it still work?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, did they leave
anything behind?

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Anything that gave them
any inclination that they

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:90%
had to leave in a hurry?

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.985 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
that would indicate

00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:84%
there would have
been a struggle,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.233 align:middle line:90%
a fight, unauthorized boarding.

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that the admiral

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
told me was, on every Navy
ship, any kind of ship--

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
submarine or surface destroyer
or aircraft carrier--

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:84%
if there's going to
be a hostile boarding,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
there's certain procedures
that the crew would

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
do to try to either scuttle
or destroy classified--

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and this submarine had a lot
of classified information.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%
None of those
procedures occurred.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the data recorders
that are kept with the admiral

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:90%
or the captain?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they got the logbook.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Because back in those
days, they were still doing

00:13:15.537 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:90%
everything by hand.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So they had the
logbook, which required

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the navigational officer
to record, every 30

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
minutes, positioning of the
ship, where it's located.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And they got that.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And the last location
was exactly where

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
the last communications
occurred.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:90%
But what happened after that?

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:90%
And where is the crew?

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Is the crew taken hostage?

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:90%
But after 20 years--

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:84%
we had a ship taken in
Korea in 1969, boarded,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:90%
and the crew members were taken.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But eventually they were
released by the North Koreans.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like them to
leave, also, the device,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:90%
the high tech, behind.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
find anything-- what

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:84%
they found regarding the
reactor was-- it was shut off.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.245 align:middle line:90%
It was properly shut down.

00:14:13.245 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, that's interesting.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is something he says
that the old reactors can do,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
but the new reactors, you
can never shut them down.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.895 align:middle line:90%
They're constantly on.

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:90%
It was properly shut down.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:90%
None of the weapons--

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
the handguns, the rifles
they had, small arms--

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:90%
was missing.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.012 align:middle line:84%
None of them were
taken off the rack.

00:14:35.012 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
breaching method?

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we both know that on
submarines, even back then,

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
there's different breaching
methods for someone

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.180 align:middle line:90%
that's already inside.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm trying to
get at-- was it already

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:90%
locked from the inside?

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Or did they have to use
unconventional breaching

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.847 align:middle line:10%
methods to open the submarine?

00:14:52.847 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The admiral didn't
go into great details

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
other than to say they were
able to open the hatch.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
particular hatch that they

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
would open first and vent, but
they wouldn't go in that hatch.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:90%
They would open another hatch.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know exactly why.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was some set
procedure, or maybe

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:90%
an emergency procedure.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
They opened one,
the crew knew it

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.222 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a hostile force trying
to get in if, in fact, there

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:90%
was still a crew there.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:90%
But there wasn't any crew.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
personal that was missing.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
As if--if the crew just
maybe abandoned the ship,

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.300 align:middle line:84%
you would think they would
take their personal pictures

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and personal items.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.705 align:middle line:90%
None of those items were taken.

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>> And still dry inside?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't flooded?

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it was not flooded.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
There was no indication
it was flooded.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
don't know how long

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:90%
it was there at Heard Island.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is, I think, from the
point of last communications

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to where it was
located some 900 miles.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So the Navy left with a
big, big, big question mark.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any
indication, Rick,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.095 align:middle line:84%
that it was just another
regular day in the sub?

00:16:07.095 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, were there beds made?

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Was there any food
on the shelves?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> They couldn't find any food.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, the first thing
they looked for, of course,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%
were bodies.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:90%
You can't find any bodies.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
They looked for
deterioration of the reactor.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:90%
It was shut down.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
They looked for logbooks, things
like that, the captain log.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And then they got
navigation log.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they went
to the kitchen,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.275 align:middle line:84%
and they opened up the
refrigerators and stuff.

00:16:31.275 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing in there.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, he thinks that
it was purposely

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:84%
emptied because somebody wanted
to preserve the submarine.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you left food in there
for 20 years, it would decay,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and it would be stinking, and
bugs and probably whatever.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So it was completely
emptied of food items,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
but all the personal
effects are still there.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:10%
So some entity, whether it's
a test that the United States

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:10%
Navy did, or whether it was an
alien extraterrestrial force

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:10%
that was living
down in Antarctica,

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:10%
tried to abduct these sailors
and capture this submarine

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:10%
for some strange reason that
we just can't understand.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Could that submarine float
900 miles on its own without

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
being driven by the
sailors and the captain?

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I asked
the admiral was that--

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the crew's taken
off the submarine,

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and now they just leave it.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:90%
They seal it and they leave it.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Can that thing float?

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
He said it would've went
right down under water.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> It would
eventually have sunk.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, so how would
it have gotten there?

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, they would
have had driven there.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
They would have had
to steer it there.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was still in
control, they got it there,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and they grounded
it up on this reef

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:90%
for some particular reason.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's been there--
well, they don't

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:84%
know how long it's been there
because the island, Heard

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Island, is inhabited only
once every few years.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And these scientists
probably wouldn't even

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
have noticed anything, except
for this one particular one who

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:90%
had some Navy experience.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And he told the captain of the
ship that brought them back.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it might have
been there forever.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> What was the admiral's--

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:90%
what was his conclusion?

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Where is it left now?

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's interesting
because the admiral,

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
when this first occurred, I
believe the Chief of Naval

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Operations was still Zumwalt
or one of the ranking admirals

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:90%
still from the World War II.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to hide
it, shut it down.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want any information
about this out in the public.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:84%
He wanted it classified,
buried, because it was

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:90%
an embarrassment to the Navy.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone would think
that nuclear power didn't work,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and it sunk because
of nuclear power.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, but
you found it again.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't have anything
to do with-- but he said,

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
how do you explain
that to the public?

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
the fact that we

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:84%
had a missing submarine in 1959,
we've searched for four months,

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and then we gave
up on the search.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1979
in December, they

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
find it on top of a reef at an
abandoned, uninhabited island

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:90%
in the South Indian Ocean?

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
that to people?

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:90%
We can't understand it today.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be
labeled as a WSFM case.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Exactly.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Weird Science
and Freakin' Magic.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and so
now, this admiral.

00:20:00.487 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what did
they do with the submarine?

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:03.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:03.763 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, how
long did he keep--

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, how long did they
keep it at Pearl Harbor?

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, they kept it at Pearl
Harbor for several years,

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
investigating.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
They went through it
with a fine-tooth comb,

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
trying to find some
evidence of something,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it was boarded
by a hostile force,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it was boarded by
an extraterrestrial force

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:90%
and they left something there.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:90%
But we couldn't find a thing.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find anything.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what do
you tell the families?

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, we already
told the families

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.123 align:middle line:90%
that they were dead in 1959.

00:20:39.123 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to go back to them

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, we
found the submarine,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't find
your loved ones.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Navy still has to
answer to the government under

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:90%
this case.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> They do, and they did,
and they classified it.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:84%
They took everything out of the
Naval logs regarding this ship.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Now it was taken out as from
Baseline to X, Submarine X.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what did
they finally do with it?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, they took it out
in the middle of the Pacific

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and scuttled it,
blew it up, and it's

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
down at the bottom of 20,000
feet of water, broken up.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Since it was a
nuclear submarine,

00:21:14.632 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
what did they do with the
nuclear materials that were

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:90%
on board?

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that the
admiral discussed that,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure they probably took
out the reactor before they

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:90%
scuttled it.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they would--

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Or at least the nuclear
material, the control rods,

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:90%
they probably took them out.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When they were analyzing
the nuclear reactor,

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
did they find anything
missing, the nuclear material?

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Like we have spoken before about
extraterrestrials coming down

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
taking different aspects
of the nuclear warheads.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> To the best of my knowledge,
no, nothing was missing.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
As the admiral reiterated
to me over and over again,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.742 align:middle line:90%
nothing was missing.

00:21:55.742 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> He would have
told you that one.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.408 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe he would
have told me if there was--

00:21:59.408 --> 00:22:02.400 align:middle line:84%
if the control rods or the
nuclear material in the reactor

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:90%
was missing.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And he never mentioned that,
so I don't believe anything

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
was missing from
the nuclear reactor.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
torpedoes on the submarine?

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Were they still active?

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Were they there?

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very,
very interesting.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions I
asked the admiral was,

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.175 align:middle line:84%
was this ship equipped
with nuclear--

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:90%
a warhead, or nuclear torpedoes?

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, they didn't
have any nuclear torpedoes.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But they had
conventional torpedoes.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
They ran with a complement
of 14 torpedoes, the ship.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> 14 total.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> They had 14 total
conventional torpedoes.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, so they were all there?

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.235 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, seven's missing.

00:22:45.235 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:10%
>> The plot thickens.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:90%
that really--

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, that changes everything.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.885 align:middle line:90%
>> That changes everything.

00:22:49.885 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:90%
There were seven that was fired.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, I believe
there were seven fired.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, and we know when or
how, or is there any recordings

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:90%
of them being fired?

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Those old submarines, they
wouldn't have had that.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
They were pressure released
and pressure fired.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.515 align:middle line:84%
He said, a lot of people
think that they just--

00:23:13.515 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:84%
there was a problem
with the submarine,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:90%
and they got rid of the seven--

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, for the weight.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for the weight.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, there are some
people within the Navy

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:84%
even today thinks that
it encountered something,

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and they were
defending themselves,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and they fired the seven
torpedoes at whatever

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.040 align:middle line:90%
the opposing force was.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But he said, if that
would have happened,

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:90%
there would have been logs.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a captain's
log that details everything

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:90%
that happens.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing that
happens on this ship

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
is recorded by a recorder.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.105 align:middle line:84%
Not the captain's doing
it, but somebody--

00:23:50.105 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
a seaman is doing
it, writing down

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:90%
everything that is occurring.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing to
indicate in any of those logs

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:90%
that they were under attack.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And the logs
were kept in there.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:90%
They weren't taken.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is very odd.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And the logs were there.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So he said, but
there's occasions when

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:90%
you don't have time to record.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
If they're instantly under
attack, everybody drops that,

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go to their
duty at the battle station,

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.500 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And their battle stations takes
precedence over everything

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.480 align:middle line:90%
else, the admiral said.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:10%
So they could be in an
attack in a battle situation

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:10%
where they're launching
those torpedoes,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:10%
and then later come back
and would record it.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:90%
So he thinks they fired.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:84%
They were attacked by an
underwater submersible--

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Something.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> UFO.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And they fired their
seven torpedoes.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Probably didn't work.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And then they were boarded.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And somehow they were taken
out, the bodies, or the crew

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
was just floated out
or dematerialized

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
or some way that the
ETs got the bodies out.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they took
over the submarine.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was the admiral's
opinion that there was possibly

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial underwater
craft involved with this

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:90%
incident?

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:90%
That was his opinion.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I asked him his opinion, and he
told me, this is my opinion--

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
The admiral is retired, and
he's friends with Bobby--

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Inman and
some of the other

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
admirals that are prominent
still in this timeframe.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's his
opinion, as there are

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.623 align:middle line:84%
others thinking the same way he
thinks, that it was attacked.

00:25:48.623 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there other incidents
like this that you know

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:90%
of, Rick?

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the admiral mentioned
some other incidents where

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:90%
ships went missing.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Not many, but there were a few.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And he speaks about an incident
involving a Soviet ship.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Both a surface ship and a
submarine, a Soviet submarine,

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
during the Cold War
era disappeared.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And they've never been
able to find that.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
The United States Navy
went out purposely

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to recover these
Soviet ships because

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.915 align:middle line:90%
of the intelligence value of it.

00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So it wasn't a cover-up
because we got involved.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't a cover-up
because we got involved.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And after the Cold
War was over with,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:84%
the Russians' Navy shared
a lot of information

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
with the US Navy regarding
missing ships, trying

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.755 align:middle line:90%
to figure out--

00:26:38.755 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:84%
the United States had the
same thing as the Russians,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
or the French, or some
of these other countries.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We didn't do it.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do it.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, who did it?

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they
shared information.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But there have been other
cases of missing surface ships

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:90%
and submarines.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think
this is happening?

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think--

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
personally, I think--
and I align myself

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot with the admiral when I
was talking to him that there

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
are forces on this Earth
that we don't know about,

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:90%
especially back in those days.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:90%
We knew of the Roswell case.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And only a limited number
of military personnel

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:90%
would have known that.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Very, very few.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:10%
So we didn't know
that there could

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:10%
be extraterrestrials
navigating our waterways,

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.650 align:middle line:10%
both above and under it.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that USS
submarine encountered

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
an underwater
extraterrestrial craft.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:10%
And whether it fought it,
tried to defend itself,

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:10%
or what the case may be,
we, the United States Navy,

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:10%
realized that their
ships were vulnerable,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:10%
their submarines
were vulnerable,

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial crafts.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.010 align:middle line:90%
We can't compete against them.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened,
I believe, in this case.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Rick, did the admiral ever
talk about the USOs or any

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:10%
of these other unidentified
submersible objects that were

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:10%
recorded on their sonars or
they saw from satellites?

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the admiral was a
former submarine commander

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:84%
for 21 years before he
made rank and moved up.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.805 align:middle line:84%
He was a captain of a
nuclear powered submarine,

00:28:24.805 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:90%
a hunter-killer submarine.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions
I asked him was,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:84%
did you ever encounter anything
strange under the water?

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, I encountered too
many to even talk about.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.190 align:middle line:84%
He said, a lot of things
that we encountered

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:84%
were things that we have
never experienced underwater.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Large squids, whales,
deformed whales,

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
things like that that we
would pick up on our sonar,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and we would watch it,
navigate, and we would track it.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't know
what it was until we

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
got close enough to
realize it's a huge squid.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a 30-foot-long squid.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, give us some sizes for
the audience because these are

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:90%
enormous creatures.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:90%
30 foot.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And he actually said, in
one particular time when

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
he was in the
South Pacific, they

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:84%
encountered a squid
that was 90 feet long.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Enormous one.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And then they had these--

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:84%
he said they had
these whales that

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:90%
were deformed that would live--

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't surface.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They would live deep
under the water,

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:84%
but they would have
to come up to feed.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.030 align:middle line:10%
And they had--

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.342 align:middle line:10%
>> They didn't need
air down there?

00:29:40.342 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Apparently they
didn't need air.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> More like a
fish of some sort.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a shark.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it was actually a whale.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And I know they're mammals,
and I know they breathe air.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But this was deformed
in some way that--

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't go
into great details.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But when it came up, these
things were 100 foot, 200 foot,

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:90%
and they were huge.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And they would appear to be,
on sonar, to be a submarine.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So they actually-- he said,
in one particular case,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:90%
they actually were shooting.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
They were battling a
whale, and realizing

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
after they hit it with a
torpedo it was the whale.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But on other occasions,
there would be things

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.030 align:middle line:84%
that they would see on sonar
that the sonar operator

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:90%
the experts couldn't identify.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Huge, huge objects
moving at lightning speed

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:90%
under the ocean.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, at one time when they
were off the coast of Alaska,

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:84%
there had been a
fishing boat in trouble.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, well, we'll
try to help this fishing boat.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:90%
And it capsized.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But they realized, because
they were a submarine,

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.950 align:middle line:84%
they would do more
harm than good.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So they went back
under the water.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
They went down to
their operating depth.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And they never talk
about operating depths.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>> No, right.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> He mentioned something
about 1,300 feet.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And as he was moving in a
southwesterly direction,

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:84%
this huge object
appears in front of him.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.433 align:middle line:84%
So he said, immediately
we took evasive maneuvers

00:31:05.433 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:90%
to get out of its way.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know what it was.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:13.190 align:middle line:84%
No known submarine or underwater
vessel could move that fast.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.242 align:middle line:90%
>> How much larger--

00:31:14.242 --> 00:31:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It was three times--

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.492 align:middle line:90%
>> --than the submarine was it?

00:31:16.492 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>> --the size of his submarine.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And as he maneuvered
out of the way,

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:90%
the sonar tracked it going by.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And just part of it had struck
the end, the aft section,

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:90%
of the submarine.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It didn't damage it to the
point where they had to surface,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.307 align:middle line:84%
but they immediately turned,
and they thought, well--

00:31:41.307 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Getting ready for the attack.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> --we're ready for the attack.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.340 align:middle line:90%
And they were nuclear tipped--

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:51.190 align:middle line:84%
their torpedoes were-- I
think they call them Astros.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were
10-kiloton-yield warheads.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So they figured,
we're going to have

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.850 align:middle line:84%
to shoot at this if
this tries to attack us.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But as it came at them,
it went up and surfaced.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.495 align:middle line:84%
And, well, they couldn't
track it any longer.

00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And once it got
out of the water,

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know where
it went from there.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.357 align:middle line:10%
But they had surface ships
that were some distance away.

00:32:15.357 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they track, or the
air traffic controllers?

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And the surface
ships saw it fly away,

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:21.670 align:middle line:90%
fly into the atmosphere.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, so that was
one of many cases

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:84%
where we actually knew it was
an underwater submersible, a UFO

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.410 align:middle line:90%
underwater, an ET craft.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But he said, we
tracked many that

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.770 align:middle line:84%
were transversing
the undercurrents

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean at
lightning speeds,

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
but we could never
catch up to them.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.330 align:middle line:90%
We knew they were down there.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, one
particular occasion,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:84%
they were down in the Indian
Ocean, Southern Indian Ocean,

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:84%
on a very highly
classified mission.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:56.410 align:middle line:84%
They were just a couple
hundred miles from Antarctica.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were deep, and he
didn't say exactly how deep.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, we were at
our maximum depth.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- we
had no lights on.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And we had some portholes
that we could see out of.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the crew members
called the bridge and says,

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.470 align:middle line:84%
you need to come down
here, the torpedo room.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:90%
You need to see this.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So the captain and the first
officer went down there.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.115 align:middle line:90%
And they had to crawl up--

00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So small, right.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --to a certain
area and look out.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And he said, look out.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And he looked out.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, my God.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.030 align:middle line:84%
That's an underwater
city down there, probably

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:90%
as big as New York City.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
It was spread out, and there
were lights all over the place.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And there were
buildings down there.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, are
we imagining this?

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And the other crew
members saying, no, sir.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing the same
thing you're seeing.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And the captain's
asking them to describe

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:84%
what they're seeing
to make sure he's

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.190 align:middle line:90%
seeing what they're seeing.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:10%
He said, this would have been
thousands and thousands of feet

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:10%
under Antarctica.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, we couldn't
go any deeper.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't go down there.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But he said, that
changed my opinion

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of the possibilities
of life being

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.938 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:34:12.938 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:84%
That's a very interesting
story he told me.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Very compelling,
especially coming from him.

00:34:16.688 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And another question
I asked him was with--

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:84%
you speak with
other submariners.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're in a society
of former submariners.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:90%
How many others saw this?

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:90%
He said, quite a few others.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.969 align:middle line:84%
>> What a compelling
story, Rick.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.427 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing, and
thank you for being on the show.

00:34:34.427 --> 00:34:35.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to be here, Emery.

00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:90%
