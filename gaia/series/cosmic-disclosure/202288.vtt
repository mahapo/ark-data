00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're with Richard Doty,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations and
was intimately involved with

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:10%
UFO ET-related content.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So while you were in the
OSI, did you see any evidence

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.665 align:middle line:90%
of a secret space program?

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:40.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:41.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about it.

00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I was briefed into one.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It was called "Gamma Sling,"
"Project Gamma Sling."

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And the program centered
around guarding the Earth

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and guarding our solar
system from dangers

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
from either asteroids or
extraterrestrial hostile

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And the first spacecraft that
was launched in accordance

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:90%
with Gamma Sling was in 1980.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It was launched into
an orbit near Mars.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And the ironic thing
about it is Voyager

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:84%
was launched in 1977,
Voyager 1 and 2,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and both those Voyagers
actually mask the launch

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
of the secret craft,
highly secret craft,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.243 align:middle line:90%
to be orbited around Mars.

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What else can you
tell us about that?

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Were there any probes
sent out, as well?

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's a lot
of probes, many probes.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of them sent towards
Jupiter or Saturn.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And they seem to want--

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
the scientists at
NASA or NSA seem

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to want to place them
in certain orbits

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
around those planets
of Saturn and Jupiter.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
They weren't so much
as exploratory craft.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
They were there to protect
or notify Earth on something

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%
approaching.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I did hear a rumor of a
naval commander saying they had

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
spotted a craft I think off of
Jupiter that was 30 miles long,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
quote, unquote, "moving
under its own steam."

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of any of these
crafts they have spotted out

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:90%
there around Jupiter and Mars?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there were several of
them launched around there.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if the one that
the naval commander is talking

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:84%
about is the one
that we launched

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
or if it was an
extraterrestrial craft.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But I knew of that program,
and I knew of those.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I was a
counterintelligence officer

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect that
program, Gamma Sling.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:90%
That was the project name.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that
much about it.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.425 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've heard
many other rumors.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked
to people talking

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:84%
about a special or
a secret space force

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:90%
with soldiers battling aliens.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
anything about that.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever met
anyone from an SSP program?

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And what did you
think about them?

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
At Area 51, we had a special
building located not too far

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:90%
from the OSI building.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
We were building 432, and
they were building a 437.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And it contained personnel
from NASA and from NSA,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:84%
from the National
Security Administration,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and from the National
Security Agency.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And their job was to
monitor the technology that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
was being developed at Area 51
to advance this secret space

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, are you aware of any
other SSP programs that are

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:90%
working at the same time?

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've had numerous
conversations with people who

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
claim to have been in different
secret space programs at UFO

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:90%
conventions and other places.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them acted
quite legitimate,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and some of them weren't.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So there could possibly be
other secret space programs

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't aware of.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:90%
That's just highly possible.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And what other authentic UFO
events can you share with us,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
such as the UFO spotted
over the Capitol in 1953?

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, during my briefing, in
1978, getting into the program,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
they briefed about legitimate
sightings of an unknown set

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:90%
of UFOs.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And those UFOs, the colonel
that briefed us said,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:90%
were in fact extraterrestrials.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We knew of it.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was the
admiral that said that?

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Colonel.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> The colonel.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Colonel that briefed
us, briefed me and others

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
into the program, he
specifically said that

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
the incident in Washington DC
was in fact extraterrestrial.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.055 align:middle line:84%
>> So if this was an actual
factual event that's caught

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
on radar, you've been told
it was by your higher-ups,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:90%
what action did they take?

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Did they feel threatened?

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Was there a new protocol
written in place?

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they scramble F-89s,
which was the most advanced

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
aircraft jet they'd had
during that time period.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And the F-89s just couldn't
keep up with the UFOs.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
The UFOs disappeared, and
they were chased by the F-86--

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:90%
F-89s.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe there were
some F-86s involved, too.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't
ever catch the UFOs.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Any other events
that you can recall?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> There was an incident
that happened in 1959 at one

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
of the pine tree
radar sites in Canada,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:90%
where a UFO had crashed.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was some distance
from the radar site.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:90%
There was Air Force--

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
US Air Force and Canadian
forces personnel that went out.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And they had an actual
encounter with an ET.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
The craft crashed.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It was on the ground
for some time.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:90%
There were photographs taken.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, the craft
was able to propel itself out

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:90%
of there.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, in 2006 at the
UFO convention at Laughlin,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:84%
one of the key players in
that did a presentation

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of that incident, where
he showed that picture

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:90%
of that craft on the ground.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:84%
It was on the ground for
some six or eight hours.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Canadian authorities
and American authorities

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:84%
really didn't know what
to do, other than circle

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:90%
it, the military police.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, the craft was able
to repair itself and fly out

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:90%
of there.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you did say there were
extraterrestrials onboard that

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:90%
interacted with the humans.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there were
extraterrestrials that when

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:84%
the military authorities-- the
Canadian and American military

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
forces-- got to the craft, it
was some distance away from

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
the radar site.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:90%
It was tracked on radar.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:90%
It went down.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.848 align:middle line:90%
They knew where it went down.

00:06:46.848 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The Americans did,
and the Canadians did.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
They went out to it, took
some time to get there.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
When they got there,
the extraterrestrials

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
were outside their craft,
either trying to repair it

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
or providing security or some
reason outside the craft.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:84%
They were in suits
almost like snow suits,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
with large helmets,
extremely large helmets.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And the pictures that were taken
by the military personnel--

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.595 align:middle line:84%
Canadians and American
military personnel--

00:07:12.595 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:90%
were from a distance.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't really get a
good description, a depiction

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:90%
of what the ETs looked like.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But the craft was a
oval-shaped craft.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It was small, wasn't very large.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
There were two creatures
that were outside the craft.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
They eventually got
inside the craft

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and flew it away
at lightning speed.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.502 align:middle line:84%
So that's really all
that we knew about it.

00:07:38.502 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Any other briefings that
stand out that you'd like

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:90%
to mention?

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the incidents
that's never been disclosed--

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen it.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard
anybody talk about it--

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
was a crash that had happened
near land over Maryland

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:90%
back in the late '50s.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
exact year of it.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But the craft
crashed in a field.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It was near a football
stadium or a sports stadium--

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
not sure it was a
football stadium.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was just after
the sporting event.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
There were several people that
saw the craft on the ground.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people that
went over to it and saw it.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But there was nothing or
nobody around the craft.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And the people were
somewhat concerned.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the local
authorities, law enforcement

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:90%
went out there.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The fire department
went out there.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But the craft was
situated in a manner

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.980 align:middle line:90%
that fooled a lot of people.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:90%
It was changing shapes.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
And so it fooled
people into thinking

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't anything other than
whatever they were looking at.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the craft was able
to propel itself out of there.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, that craft flew right
over Andrews Air Force Base,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
which is where the US
president flies out of when

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:90%
he leaves Washington, DC.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
There were aircraft
scrambled from Andrews.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, there were probably F-89s
scrambled after this craft.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, the
craft, they lost it

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:90%
over the Atlantic Ocean.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
That was quite an interesting
story the colonel told us

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:90%
about that incident.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen
or heard any mention

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
of that in any kind of
UFO literature since.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing, amazing stuff.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Rick, there's a
lot of these videos

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:90%
online of alien autopsies.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.235 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm not sure if
they're legitimate or not.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.303 align:middle line:84%
I've seen many of them online
that probably were staged.

00:09:42.303 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell
you about one that

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:90%
has never been released online.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
This is an actual
alien autopsy that

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
was done on the EBENs
that crashed in 1947.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I saw parts of that
in my briefing.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But later on, while I was
working in intelligence,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I saw the complete autopsy film.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:90%
And that was legitimate.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you see?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It was an EBEN, the--

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Small grays--

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Small grays.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
It had some really catastrophic
injuries to it, the body.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And the pathologists that
were doing the autopsy

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
were taking a long
time doing the autopsy.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I think the film lasted about
an hour and a half, which

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is probably a little bit
more than a normal autopsy

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
would last.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But it was taking
apart every single bone

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:84%
or every single tissue, every
single organ that they could

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
find in the body, and analyzing
it and talking about it

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
while they're doing
it, explaining

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that this isn't a human body.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
A human wouldn't
have this organ here,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:84%
or the skin texture
wouldn't be this of a human.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Or the underlying
epidermal of the skin

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be this and the bone.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.912 align:middle line:90%
They were explaining this all.

00:10:59.912 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was obvious
in watching this,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't a human being that
they were doing an autopsy on.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this in any relation to
that interrogation video online

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial being
interrogated and speaking?

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that authentic?

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some
that are online.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:84%
There was one online
probably 10 or 15 years ago

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.290 align:middle line:90%
that was pulled off online.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:90%
That was legitimate.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That was the same one I
saw when I was at Area 51.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:90%
I saw it was closed-circuit.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually
see them doing it.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I was at another
location, watching it

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:90%
on a closed-circuit camera.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was an interrogation
done on one of the ETs.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a small
gray, whitish--

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, a small gray whitish.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that was a legitimate one.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another one
on that you can barely

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:84%
hear the interrogator
and you can barely

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:90%
see the extraterrestrial.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:90%
I think that's staged.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You were involved with
a controversial researcher,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Paul Bennewitz.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:90%
What happened with that?

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was a
counterintelligence officer

00:11:58.293 --> 00:11:59.480 align:middle line:90%
at Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:10%
And Paul Bennewitz came
to us with photographs

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:10%
and electronic signals that he
had collected from Kirtland Air

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:10%
Force Base.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.205 align:middle line:84%
Paul lived just outside
the northeast perimeter

00:12:13.205 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And he had gathered some
information, electronic signals

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:90%
and photographs.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:90%
And he came to OSI.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've filmed
this on your base,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm afraid that
your base is being

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
subjected to extraterrestrial
hostile intent.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, when he first came to
us, we kind of questioned him.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we did an
investigation on him.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
things Paul was doing

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:84%
was collecting signals on a
highly classified operation

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that was involving
the National Security

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Administration on Kirtland.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And I can talk about this now
because it's been declassified.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1980 and
the early 1980s,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the NSA had perfected
a laser that could

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:90%
travel long distances in space.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And what we were doing was every
time a Soviet satellite passed

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
over Kirtland Air Force
Base or in close proximity,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:84%
we would shoot that
laser up to the lens

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of the camera and
blind the camera

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
so the Russians couldn't
take any pictures.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And we also had-- the NSA
also had a facility at Area 51

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:90%
that did the exact same thing.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.190 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the early '80s.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
It was an experimental
laser, but it worked.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
released since.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
There's been some information
in books about it,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:90%
so it's not classified anymore.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But Paul was collecting
data from that.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So what we had to do was
we had to convince Paul

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that what he was collecting
was extraterrestrial emissions

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and all those photographs
he was taking,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
which were of classified
drone operations,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
that they were all UFO-related.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't hard to do because
Paul was a believer in UFOs.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Paul had been a member of
MUFON and APRO for years.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:90%
So Paul believed in this stuff.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So it was pretty easy
for us to convince Paul

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that what he was
seeing was UFO-related.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> He would believe anything
you would say, of course,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
because you guys
are the number one.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.507 align:middle line:90%
He would believe everything.

00:14:25.507 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't hard
for us to do that.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:90%
We would just nod--

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.805 align:middle line:84%
I would just nod
and say, yeah, I

00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
think you've got
something there.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You're actually encouraging
him with this disinformation

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:90%
campaign.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And he believed it,
and we did our job.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But ironically, Paul was
taking some other photographs

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that were not research
and development graphs.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Paul was a pilot.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
He was on a flight
from Albuquerque

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:90%
to Chama, New Mexico.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> He was going up to Archuleta
Peak near Dulce to take

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
pictures of what was
occurring up there.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:84%
On his way back, he had
a person in the co-pilot

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:90%
seat, one of his workers.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.017 align:middle line:84%
As they got about over Red
River, in that area there--

00:15:15.017 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:90%
anybody from Mexico would know--

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Love Red River.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes--

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> He saw this huge craft
fly over top of him.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, his partner had a camera,
so he started filming this.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And this craft was hovering
right above Paul's Cessna 180.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And Paul took a picture of that.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't our craft.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
that came from.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
When Paul got back,
he immediately

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
called me at the office
and told me, hey, Rick,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:90%
you need to come down here.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I got some photographs.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:90%
He had his own photo lab.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I took some pictures of
something you need to see.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll come
down there, Paul.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So I went down to the
office the next day,

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:90%
and Paul had his big--

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:90%
he made 8 by 10s.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, you tell
me what that is.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it, and I
had no idea what it was.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, where'd
you take this, Bob?

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, over Red
River in New Mexico.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I was coming back from
Dulce, and I saw this craft.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, that is an
extraterrestrial craft.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the mothership.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was a huge craft.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, let me
take this back to the office

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and have it analyzed
and try to figure out

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:90%
what the heck this is.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I took it back to
the office and laid it down,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and all the other agents that
were working on this operation

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.783 align:middle line:90%
said, holy cow--

00:16:34.783 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:90%
well, they didn't say "cow."

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:90%
They said something else--

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:90%
that's a real one.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:90%
He took a picture of a real one.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And so what do we do now?

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, are we going to convince
him that is one of ours

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
or if that's one of theirs?

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:90%
We were somewhat confused.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But after that point, Paul,
you couldn't convince Paul

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:90%
otherwise.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> He was thoroughly convinced
that what he was seeing,

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:84%
what he was taking
pictures of, were UFOs.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we just
let it go at that.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.615 align:middle line:84%
But we were interested in
this one picture he took.

00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't figure out
where it came from.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And he had a
witness on top of it.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:90%
>> And he had a witness.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he had a witness.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So describe this
craft in the photo.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.900 align:middle line:90%
You said it was really large.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:84%
What other details
could you tell us?

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> This craft probably was 100
foot in diameter, at least.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:90%
It was oblong.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.418 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't really tell the
shape because of the angle

00:17:27.418 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that the photograph
was taken, but it

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:90%
looked like saucer-shaped.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And the ironic thing about
this, it had a little portals.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
into the portals

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
because the craft was that
close to his aircraft.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And the photographer,
his partner,

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:90%
was photographing this.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You could see the little
creatures inside those portals.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
They were moving
around in there.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And these still photographs
that he was taking,

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
he took probably 10
or 12 over a period

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.728 align:middle line:90%
of maybe 15 or 20 seconds.

00:17:58.728 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And then the craft disappeared.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It took off.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And the propulsion system--

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
another ironic thing
that he photographed

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.943 align:middle line:84%
was arcs coming down from
the bottom of the craft.

00:18:10.943 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that we could
figure out what they were--

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:90%
a propulsion system in some--

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Did he say what
color the arcs were?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Just white.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:90%
It was like lightning.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Lightning.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like lightning.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was hovering
there as they flew by.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Another ironic thing
is the plane's moving.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Paul says he's going
about 140 knots.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And this craft is
hovering above him

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
so that, obviously, this
craft is going the same speed.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, we asked Paul.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.205 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
I asked Paul was,

00:18:36.205 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:90%
was there any missing time?

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:90%
And were you watching your--

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Instruments--

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Your instruments to see
if, in fact, you stopped,

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.448 align:middle line:90%
because maybe the air--

00:18:45.448 --> 00:18:46.948 align:middle line:84%
he said, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good pilot.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:90%
And he was IFR and VFR.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, no, no, no, no.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I was still going.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.360 align:middle line:90%
I looked down.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:90%
I was going 140 knots.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, and
that's maintained?

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:90%
It almost touched my aircraft.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I said, why do you think
this craft came after you?

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, because I
was up near Dulce.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
there were a lot

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
of people thought that there
was a secret base at Dulce

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and they were flying
UFOs out of it.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And Paul thought that, too.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Paul said, well, I
was up near Dulce.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I flew over Dulce, and it
was chasing me out of there.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what Paul told us.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you know about Dulce?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Dulce is an
interesting place.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot
of stories about Dulce

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and the war that allegedly
occurred down there

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and a particular person
that came on YouTube

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and made a video about it
that was missing a finger

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
questions about what

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:90%
was happening in Dulce.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know at the time
what was happening up there,

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
so I went up there with Paul
a couple different times.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.242 align:middle line:84%
And I saw strange
things happening.

00:19:56.242 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I started looking
within the intelligence

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:84%
community to find out, hey, does
anybody within the intelligence

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:90%
community know about this?

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:84%
When I checked with
Army Intelligence

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
at Fort Carson, Colorado, they
told me, well, we can tell you.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to be in person.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.002 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have to get
this and this and this ticket

00:20:14.002 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:90%
punched.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So I got all those
tickets punched.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:90%
I went up to Fort Carson.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Army Intel, G2, and I sat down.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And they explained to me
what was going on at Dulce.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a Special
Forces training base.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And the strange lights
that we were seeing

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:84%
were lights that were
built into the ground.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were navigation lights
for helicopters coming in.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
They'd turn these lights on,
and the helicopter would come in

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.337 align:middle line:90%
to follow these lights.

00:20:40.337 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
navigational aids

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.900 align:middle line:84%
up there, TACAN
and other things,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
which is a tactical
air navigation system.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And that answered about
90% of my questions

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:84%
about where all these
strange things were.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Why did they see
these strange lights?

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were
navigation lights.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:90%
And so that answered it.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:90%
But still, there was some--

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Could they be giving
you disinformation, Rick?

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> No, because we
went up there when--

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
they told me when the next
operation was going to be.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It was going to be the 160th,
which was a Special Forces

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
flight unit, and a Delta Force
team that was going to train up

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:90%
there on a certain date.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.315 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it was 1980,
maybe latter part of '79,

00:21:19.315 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure, or maybe even '81.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, we went up
there, and we saw it.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.165 align:middle line:90%
We witnessed it.

00:21:26.165 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, that part of
it answered it.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, was there something else
that the army was hiding?

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Paul did see something
just a few hundred miles away

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So that raises a
lot of questions that--

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:90%
who knows?

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a possibility.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I always question other
intelligence agencies

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.453 align:middle line:84%
when they tell you,
because you always

00:21:48.453 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:84%
know they're not
telling you everything.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> They'll tell you
what you want to hear,

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
but they're not telling you
everything you want to hear.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:90%
I totally believe that.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I was once told, everything you
see and do down here, 5% of it

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is completely
disinformation and false,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:90%
just to keep you in check.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's true,
because I was on the side

00:22:12.695 --> 00:22:13.533 align:middle line:90%
of disinformation.

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we know you're
not disinforming us right now,

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Rick?

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've been
out a long time.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:10%
And I can prove--

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:10%
I have documents and other ways
of verifying what I'm saying.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:10%
I have no reason now
to disinform anyone.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm not involved in a
disinformation campaign

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.390 align:middle line:10%
with the Central Intelligence
Agency or DIA or OSI,

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:10%
like a lot of people
are saying right now.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my own.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I do my own thing.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I tell the truth.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:90%
What I don't know, I won't say.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll tell you
I don't know it.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
But what I say is factual.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you determine what
people and information needs

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:90%
to be discredited?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's done
by not me personally.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:90%
It's done by our organization.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:84%
We find the person
that might have

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
some information
about a classified

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
operation or a
classified project

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
or might have come upon some
kind of a classified vehicle.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:90%
They're reported.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:90%
The information is gathered.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody above
me determines that we need

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to perform a disinformation--
we call it "counterintelligence

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:90%
operation"--

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:84%
disinform that person
because they just had access

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:90%
to highly classified material.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not going to do an
operation on anything other

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
than top secret, highly
classified material.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
People that have
access to minor stuff

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:84%
like confidential or secret,
we're not going to do it,

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:84%
unless it's some kind
of a special case.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to nuclear
weapons, we might do it.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But anything else,
we wouldn't do it

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:90%
unless it was highly classified.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And most of the operations that
we ran to disinform somebody

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
was because they had access to
highly classified information,

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
such as a research and
development aircraft that they

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:84%
saw fly over or land or
some kind of technology

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that we were working on
that has to remain secret.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, back
in the '80s, we

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.132 align:middle line:84%
had the Russians that were
breathing down our neck.

00:24:19.132 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were after
everything they

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:90%
could get their hands onto.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So we had to protect
the national security.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
do that is if somebody

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.610 align:middle line:84%
had access to national security
and they weren't authorized to,

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:90%
we had to disinform them.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And we did that, and we did
it in a professional manner.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever have any
moles in your agency?

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we did.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We had one or two
during our time at OSI.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We had one particular
mole that we caught,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and they prosecuted him.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But our integrity was
pretty high within OSI.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there was an incident
at Bolling Air Force Base with

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:84%
some of these tall white Nordics
with some military officers.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us
anything about that?

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:10%
>> This was a horrible incident
that happened at Bolling Air

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:10%
Force Base in the '80s.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:84%
A group of officers--
general officers, colonels,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and I think a couple generals--

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
were in a meeting in a secure
area of Bolling Air Force Base.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't discussing
anything to do with UFOs.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
They were just there talking
about highly classified

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
other projects, when suddenly
these strange-looking creatures

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
came through the walls, as told
by a couple of the survivors.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And they started
mutilating and attacking

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:90%
these general officers.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Several of the officers
suffered very serious injuries,

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and some of them died.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
They were after the equipment
that was in this room.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And the strange thing about it,
the equipment they were after

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
was overhead viewers and things
like that, a slide presentation

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
machine and a
60-millimeter projector.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And nobody seemed to know why
they would want those items.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But these officers were
mutilated, some of them.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Some of them had--

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> In what way?

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Through hand-to-hand
combat or weapons?

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> They were
attacking them with--

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
no, their hands,
their own hands.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.140 align:middle line:84%
The aliens were putting their
hands through the bodies.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:90%
They were tearing off limbs.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
There was one lieutenant
colonel that lost both arms.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:40.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a general that
suffered severe injuries that

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:90%
caused him to be paralyzed.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So he had to be
medically discharged.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:90%
There were others.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were security forces
there, Air Force police--

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
the call them "security
police"-- were there.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:90%
And they came in.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
When the security
police came, they

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.030 align:middle line:84%
weren't in the room,
the security police.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:84%
They were on the
outside of the room--

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right--

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Because they weren't cleared.

00:27:00.303 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But when they got into the, room
the entities-- these creatures,

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.690 align:middle line:90%
the Nordics-- left.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the security
police witness this?

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The security police didn't
actually witness the attack,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.750 align:middle line:84%
but they obviously witnessed
the injuries that weren't caused

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:90%
by anybody in the room.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.920 align:middle line:84%
These were
catastrophic injuries.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:90%
You can't rip off an arm.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
A human can't rip off an arm
or rip off their own arm.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.092 align:middle line:90%
And these arms and leg--

00:27:27.092 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a leg or
an ankle or something that

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:90%
was ripped off.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Doctors said later that somebody
with a huge amount of force

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
would have to rip off an
arm from the shoulder.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't believe
any of the security

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.508 align:middle line:90%
forces actually saw it happen.

00:27:45.508 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
But there were a lot of--

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:84%
there were other people that
weren't injured in the room.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.688 align:middle line:84%
There was a master sergeant
that was the projector operator.

00:27:54.688 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
other people that

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
were enlisted people in the room
that were aides or something.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.355 align:middle line:90%
They weren't injured.

00:28:00.355 --> 00:28:02.147 align:middle line:84%
It was just the officers
that were injured.

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So they watched this.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Did they get any film
of this going on?

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I don't believe
there was any film.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.355 align:middle line:84%
>> So there were
how many survivors?

00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there were
eight survivors--

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Out of 12--

00:28:11.887 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Eight or nine survived.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I think two died, and
the rest survived.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe one died
sometime later,

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
the exact numbers.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the exact numbers.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
OSI from Andrews Air Force
Base went over there,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
investigated this, and that
was really highly classified.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe it still
is classified.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:10%
I haven't heard--

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:10%
I heard one other person
mentioning this story,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:10%
and that was Wendelle Stevens,
the late Wendelle Stevens,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:10%
who was a prominent figure
within the UFO community

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:10%
that would speak at most all
UFO conferences in Laughlin

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:10%
or other places in
the United States.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Wendelle had more
details about it

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.500 align:middle line:84%
because Wendelle
actually interviewed

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:90%
one of the survivors.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a lieutenant colonel.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And what did he say?

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Lieutenant colonel said
that he told a story of these

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:84%
creatures just came
through the wall.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.755 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- obviously,
if you're sitting there

00:29:07.755 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:84%
at some kind of
a meeting and you

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:84%
see creatures coming through
the wall, that would stun you.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was
stunned, thinking it

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of
hallucination or something.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.925 align:middle line:84%
>> And then these creatures
started attacking these

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:90%
officers.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And now, some of the enlisted
people tried to stop it,

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:90%
tried to step in.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.900 align:middle line:84%
By the time the security forces
got in there, it was over with.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:84%
The whole attack
didn't last more

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:31.695 align:middle line:90%
than three or four minutes.

00:29:31.695 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:90%
How horrific.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, has this ever been
answered by the Nordic ET

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:90%
race since then?

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Did they ever take
responsibility for this?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.063 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't know that.

00:29:43.063 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have known.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.855 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't know that.

00:29:44.855 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
after this incident,

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.020 align:middle line:84%
the Nordics were
declared to be hostile.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were
blood-and-gut entities,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:90%
so you could kill them.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:84%
You could shoot
them and kill them.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.123 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there
was a shoot-on-sight order

00:30:03.123 --> 00:30:04.040 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But I know they were
declared to be hostile.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're obviously using
some sort of portal technology

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to come in and leave
at their own will.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Or they teleported in.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:84%
That was a lot-- a lot of
questions went unanswered.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:90%
How'd they get in?

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Did they just come
through the wall?

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Or it could have
been a diversion, too.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
They might have been doing
something else on the base.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any other field
investigations you'd like

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:90%
to share with the audience?

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, one particular one.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
It was while I was conducting
the operation against Paul

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Bennewitz that we
came upon a woman

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Myrna Hansen.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Myrna came to us.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:84%
She was recommended--
they recommended

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
she see a government agent
regarding her experiences.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed Myrna
Hansen, and she told me

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:90%
she had been abducted by ETs.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know the types of
aliens she was interacting

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> The grays.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>> The grays.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she described them as
small, three- to four-foot ETs

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.890 align:middle line:84%
with large eyes, small
noses, small mouths.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:90%
They didn't talk to her.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:90%
It was all telepathic.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.830 align:middle line:90%
It was the typical greys.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> She told me this wild story
over a period of several hours.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:84%
She was a woman who had
very little education.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.410 align:middle line:90%
She had a son.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
She was driving from
Angel Fire, New Mexico--

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Angel Fire--

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> To Eagle Nest, New Mexico.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Eagle Nest.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And she lost time.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.440 align:middle line:84%
She missed a lot of
time, 10 or 12 hours.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And she found herself
along Eagle Nest Lake

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:84%
with her son, her
seven-year-old son.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And her car, she
couldn't find it.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, state police
found the vehicle someplace,

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and she got her vehicle back.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And she came back
to Albuquerque,

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and she talked to
several people,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:90%
including Paul Bennewitz.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.117 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz's
secretary was her friend--

00:32:09.117 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:90%
her mother's friend.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So the mother got
in touch with Paul,

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.600 align:middle line:84%
thinking that he might know
where she could go with this.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And then Paul then
referred it to us.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, I interviewed her.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:84%
She told us a story
about being taken

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:90%
to this underground facility.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:33.260 align:middle line:84%
She went down she didn't know
how many feet, maybe 100 feet.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:84%
She described this circular
area with a ladder, a portal

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to her left, and all concrete.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:84%
While she was telling me
this, I knew exactly what

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:90%
she was describing.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.620 align:middle line:84%
She was describing out
in Coyote Canyon, which

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:84%
was a test site for
Kirtland Air Force Base,

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.100 align:middle line:84%
there was a research
and development--

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:84%
they were making a bunker
for nuclear weapons,

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:84%
experimenting with
different types of ways

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.020 align:middle line:90%
to store nuclear weapons.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:84%
This particular place
that she was describing

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:84%
was located out
at Coyote Canyon.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a concrete structure
that went down about 60 feet.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to
store a nuclear weapon--

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
put a nuclear weapon inside
and shut the front door.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The nuclear weapon
would drop down 60 feet.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They'd cover it up so the
nuclear weapon was hidden.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So if a terrorist broke
into the structure,

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't find
the nuclear weapon.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
She described this perfectly,
absolutely perfectly.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But she told us this portal
to her left, she opened it.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And there were vats, many vats--
she couldn't explain how many--

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.820 align:middle line:90%
with human bodies in them.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And she was taken
to one of them.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, when she was
explaining this to me,

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I had started asking her, do
you have a boyfriend that's

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:90%
in the military?

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been at
Kirtland Air Force Base?

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Have your parents ever
been in the military, so

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:90%
on, so on, so on?

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.120 align:middle line:84%
No, never been to Kirtland,
never been out there--

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know anything
about the base.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, how
would she know this?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.702 align:middle line:90%
So I went out there to the base.

00:34:14.702 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:90%
I went to the structure.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:90%
I went down there.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:84%
The only thing she had
wrong that I couldn't find

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:90%
were any portals.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.469 align:middle line:84%
There was a door that you could
open up with the right key

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:84%
to open, and it was
an escape hatch.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's the only
thing I could find.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And there weren't any vats
with human bodies in them.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.719 align:middle line:84%
I re-interviewed her
several different times,

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.480 align:middle line:90%
asking about her experiences.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And she told me the exact same
story over and over again.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.602 align:middle line:90%
If a person's lying--

00:34:46.602 --> 00:34:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> They're going to slip up--

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:49.489 align:middle line:90%
>> They're going to slip up.

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:51.710 align:middle line:84%
When you ask them a
story and they're lying,

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:90%
they're going to slip up.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then we decided to do a
polygraph examination on her.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So we got her a
polygraph examiner.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And we had probably the
best polygraph examiners

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.330 align:middle line:90%
in the federal government.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And they do this--

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.100 align:middle line:84%
they call it the
counterintelligence type

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.748 align:middle line:84%
of a polygraph, where they
hook you up and they tell you,

00:35:14.748 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask you questions.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I want you to say no to
every one of these questions.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the next strip,
they're going to say,

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I want you to answer yes to
every one of these questions.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And the third time around,
I want you to tell me

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:90%
the truth, yes or no.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And you can't beat that.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't care who you are.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know because we had
to take those polygraphs.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And you can't beat it.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no way
you can beat this.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.760 align:middle line:90%
And she passed it.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.310 align:middle line:84%
There was no deception
whatsoever indicated.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:90%
They do it by numbers.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.880 align:middle line:84%
The higher the number--
the plus numbers,

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.450 align:middle line:84%
the higher the indication
that you might be deceptive.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:84%
She was a minus five,
meaning she was as truthful

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.090 align:middle line:90%
as you could possibly be.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The pope couldn't have
done better than that.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> How did she recall this?

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Was it like mind control?

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Did the ET show her something
of how it is in modern-day

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.120 align:middle line:84%
or what it might be in
the future down there?

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after the polygraph,
we wanted to give her a hypnotic

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.230 align:middle line:84%
interview, where we have
our own psychologists.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You were taking it serious.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> We took it serious.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:84%
My supervisor, he
suggested it to me.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why
are we doing this?

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Breach of security.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.730 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> She doesn't know anything.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And maybe she had some
kind of experience.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was something
to do with the mind,

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that somebody planted
that in her mind.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the ETs planted
it in her mind.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.410 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.355 align:middle line:84%
My supervisor said,
we're going to do

00:36:39.355 --> 00:36:40.725 align:middle line:90%
a hypnotic interview on her.

00:36:40.725 --> 00:36:41.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So we set it up, brought
the psychiatrist in.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.270 align:middle line:84%
He does a hypnotic interview,
regressed her back.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.080 align:middle line:84%
She repeated exactly
the same thing.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't deviate one iota from
what she originally told me.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love it.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, we have this third
measure that we used in very,

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.590 align:middle line:84%
very, very, very
rare circumstances.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We can actually do a polygraph
on a person's subconscious

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.230 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.890 align:middle line:84%
We put them under hypnosis,
and we give them a polygraph.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:17.810 align:middle line:84%
This time, we just
ask them yes or no.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.460 align:middle line:90%
We did that.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was an amazing response
because the polygrapher that

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:84%
was doing it said, I don't
think this is going to work.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We've done it before,
normally with spies and people

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think this is
going to work, he said.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.630 align:middle line:84%
But he interviewed her, and
he got with the psychiatrist

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.008 align:middle line:90%
and finally put her under.

00:37:39.008 --> 00:37:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So they did
medicate her for this.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> They had to medicate her.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And same thing-- told
us the exact same story.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, fantastic.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.205 align:middle line:84%
>> So now, what am
I supposed to think?

00:37:49.205 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Here, I'm the case agent.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.050 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
just think about it?

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.008 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's telling me
she's telling the truth,

00:37:55.008 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:84%
so I have to go with the fact
that she's telling the truth.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Everything she says is truthful.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:90%
How did the ETs get out there?

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.470 align:middle line:90%
How did the ETs create this?

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.503 align:middle line:84%
And why isn't there
these vats that--

00:38:05.503 --> 00:38:07.670 align:middle line:84%
why can't we find these
vats with these human bodies

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:90%
in them?

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Can I ever find out?

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was
we took care of her.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:90%
We paid for her medical.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We gave her access
to the VA facility,

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.930 align:middle line:90%
the government facility.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We filled all her
prescriptions for her.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.610 align:middle line:84%
We actually bought
her a trailer.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.560 align:middle line:84%
We bought her a trailer
and placed her and her son

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.485 align:middle line:90%
And we gave her some money.

00:38:33.485 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:90%
She eventually got a job.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I kept contact with
her over the years.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:90%
She eventually moved to Texas.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:90%
She had relatives in Texas.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.845 align:middle line:90%
She eventually moved to Texas.

00:38:43.845 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So what else did
you learn from her?

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And how did you
close out that case?

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.580 align:middle line:84%
What did you write
for the commander?

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we learned a
lot of things from her.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
We learned, number one,
that a lot of our techniques

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.270 align:middle line:90%
actually worked.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Hypnosis, the polygraphs,
the hypnotic polygraph,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:90%
all these things worked.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And that she was truthful
in her experience--

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:84%
she proved without
a shadow of a doubt

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.170 align:middle line:90%
that what she told us was truth.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.510 align:middle line:90%
But how can it be the truth?

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:90%
What happened to her mind?

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Who planted that in her mind?

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.820 align:middle line:84%
There were so many
questions that we

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
had that weren't answered, that
we had no way of answering.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Even though we talked to
her many times afterwards,

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't explain
her experience.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know why
they took her there.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And was it a facsimile
place that it

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.720 align:middle line:84%
looked like where we were, where
our place was, but maybe it

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:84%
was at some other location
that the aliens created?

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:90%
It got complex.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.210 align:middle line:84%
It got really, really,
really complex.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I closed it out by
saying, I believed her.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:90%
What she told us was the truth.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And really, there isn't any
other counterintelligence

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.670 align:middle line:90%
aspect of this case.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%

fascinating information.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
