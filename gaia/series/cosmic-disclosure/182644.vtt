00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: We're here
with John Lear today.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
talking about Area

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:84%
51 and secret
underground facilities.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.115 align:middle line:10%
John, now I have never been
to Area 51, Groom Lake, S4.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I was over at White Sands,
Los Alamos, Sandia Labs,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:90%
What are the differences?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.813 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:00:38.813 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN LEAR: The
closest I've been

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
is flying over the nuke
area, right here, where they

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:90%
used to set out to nuke blasts.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I flew North American
OB10, and my job

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
was to give the winds from
ground level to 10,000 feet.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So that in case it
vented, it wasn't going

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:90%
to blow towards Las Vegas.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They wanted it to
go to the north,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and so that's what my
job, to give the wind.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I always did it two
hours before the shot,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle line:84%
so I had a lot of
time to look around.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
noticed was, to the north,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:90%
this huge expanse area of white.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure out
what was making it white,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and only years later
did I figure out

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that I was looking into
the Pahute Mesa and also

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:90%
the Rainier mountains.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And what they had done is cut
off the top of a mountain.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:84%
They built the secret test
site, the Sandia test site,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:84%
inside and then put
the top back on.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:10%
When they took it off,
it was all quartz,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:10%
and that's what made it white.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, of course.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Years later, I found
out that we had a friend of ours

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that his father drove
a cement truck--

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and I call it Sandia.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they
call it these days.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
used to call it.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: And it was their idea
to name the new secret bases

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
a name that was always
used for somewhere else.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: So if somebody
said that name,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:84%
they would say, oh, they meant
Sandia Corporation or Sandia

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Range or Sandia Mountain
or something like that.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was the way they
started naming facilities

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and why they used names
that were so common.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
Sandia base, there

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
was five holes, 300 feet wide,
that went down a mile deep.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
They were originally built
by using nuclear blasts

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and make an area.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, they make a
drive down there,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
so that these cement trucks
could drive down then and drop

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:90%
the cement.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: And it usually
took a day to get down

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and half the night
to get back up.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
One of our friend's father
did this and told us

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:90%
what was going on there.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
building is five of them,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and each one was to hold
15,000 armed combat troops.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And they had facilities
to live, they

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
had a place to eat, they had
place to exercise, all kinds--

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This was--

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Sandia.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sandia, OK.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: That was part of Sandia.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Part of Sandia.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Now, why they
were protecting it,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.538 align:middle line:84%
or ready to protect
it, I don't know why.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So John,
when were you first

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.243 align:middle line:90%
introduced to Area 51 and why?

00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: It's an
interesting story.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I was flying gliders
in the Pahrump Valley,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and because a lot of the workers
at Area 51 lived in Pahrump,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
some of them would gravitate
down to this airfield.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing went on
there, and they didn't--

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
nothing else was going on and
there was only a few people

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:90%
there at any time.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, after
one of my flights,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
we're all sitting
around talking,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and I happened to have a
map of the Nevada test site

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the guys said,
yeah, I work out there,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
but I don't get
any Area 51 stuff.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, Area 51,
I never heard that before.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
checking round Area 51

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and found out that that
surrounded Groom Lake.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd heard about Groom Lake,
because when I first came up

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:84%
to Vegas, in 1966, to start
that third level airline,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I knew a guy named Dick
Wiesner, and he flew for Carco.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Carco was the predecessor
of Special Projects,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and they flew bonanzas
and twin bonanzas,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and they flew the F27
to Dr. Teller's place.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And Dick was telling me one
day about taking a flight north

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
with a general, and
he said, there's

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:84%
a strip that was so long
you wouldn't believe it.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's it called?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.708 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they
call it Groom Lake,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's the first
I heard of Groom Lake.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the same time,
I put Area 51 together,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
because I thought all of
this was up at Tonopah.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.137 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: But it wasn't.

00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:90%
It was in Groom Lake.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I first
learned about that.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Somebody gave me the
original 1976 radar tapes

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:90%
of the topography of the area.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't specifically
for that area,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
it just happened to
include that area.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: You can see the original
holes, the original holes

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:90%
that they built.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, what
year was that?

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: '76.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That they
were starting to build?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: And that's when they
closed Groom Lake to everybody.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
There was no guards, no
engineers, no airplanes,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:84%
no nothing between
1975 and 1976.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
that work at there

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
is a security guard,
he said, to this day,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they were doing.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
They were building S4, and
that's why it was so secret.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how long did that
take for them to complete that?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Two years.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Two years?

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And how deep is that S4?

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Then, it was
only six stories,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
but right now, it covers 70
acres and god knows how many.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend that was
driving out on the lakebed,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Papoose lakebed, and all of a
sudden, nine guards appeared.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, they came
out of nowhere,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.185 align:middle line:84%
and they told us to
get out of there.

00:05:56.185 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And we said, well,
we didn't know

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
this was a restricted area,
and they said, well, it is.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I have no
idea where they came from.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:90%
They just appeared.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come
up from the ground.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%
They didn't come from the air.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they came from.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about the
transportation system

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.977 align:middle line:84%
coming out of Groom Lake,
underground facility

00:06:14.977 --> 00:06:15.935 align:middle line:90%
transportation systems?

00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:18.770 align:middle line:10%
Do you know anything
about those maglev tubes

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:10%
and how they're connected to
Alamogordo and White Sands

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:10%
Missile Range, up to
Mountain Air, over to Sandia,

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:10%
up to Los Alamos, then
Dulce, then Blanca Peak?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:10%
There's another center
there, and that goes up

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:10%
to Colorado Springs to Denver.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:10%
That's the only one I know of.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:10%
I know there's a
lot more, I read.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are the only ones
I can confirm myself.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about these underground?

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Just they
exist, as you said,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have any
independent confirmation.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Except a friend I have
was and did work at Dulce,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and he used to take the
underground transportation

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.400 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And when Bob worked
at S4, he read

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:90%
the story of the altercation.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the altercation
happened in 1979,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and there were 66
people killed--

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
40 scientists and a number of
Delta Force, a total of 66.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:10%
Now, when Bob read the report,
it didn't mention Dulce,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:10%
because his clearance
at that time,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.010 align:middle line:10%
or what was being elevated,
it didn't include Dulce.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.078 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So John, the
altercation that happened,

00:07:30.078 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:90%
let's try to tell the audience.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: OK.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.182 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's start from like
this is the first time they're

00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:90%
hearing it.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: What happened was
I first heard about Dulce

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
when I was at
Crestone, Colorado.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
In 1988, a group of the
top so-called ufologists

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:84%
all just got together to
spend a couple of days trading

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:84%
A guy named Tom Adams,
who lived in Dallas

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and had a lot of good
information, came up to me

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.797 align:middle line:84%
and says, John, I have this note
from this lady in Henderson,

00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
time to follow it up.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Would you follow it up for me?

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:90%
So I read the note.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
It was from Cherry Hinkle
who lived in Henderson.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
She knew a security guard
who worked at Dulce,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and he had escaped with
seven minutes of video

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
of a hallway, 25 black
and white photos, and 100

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
pages of information, technical
information, about Dulce.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And the security guard
was friends with Cherry,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know how.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.466 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this security
guard feared for his life,

00:08:34.466 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
because they had these people
that go out specifically--

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
I forget what you call
them-- to find escapees.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:84%
And he knew they were going
to get him eventually,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and what he did
is he put together

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:90%
six packs of information.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I remember this.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.383 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
three, but yeah, six.

00:08:49.383 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: And Cherry
had one of them.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
She kept her name
out of circulation.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we originally
talked, she said,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:84%
don't mention my name,
but recently, she

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:90%
has a Facebook page.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:84%
You can type in Cherry Hinkle
and get her whole story.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And she will remember
the day that I met her,

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and she gave me all
the Dulce information.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Took me down to Dolan
Springs, north of Kingman,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to show me where
she hid her packet.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was in some kind
of a small container

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that the guy at Dulce
had put together,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I first
heard about Dulce.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that told
me about the altercation

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
at Dulce, how it happened.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did it actually happen
in Dulce or did it actually

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:90%
happen in--

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Actually at Dulce.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: At Dulce.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: They had 40 or 44
scientists being taught

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
in this auditorium by one gray,
and during this education,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:84%
a Delta security guard walked
in the door with a sidearm.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:90%
He didn't point it.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it was just
that he had ammunition

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
within sight of a gray, and
they killed him instantly.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:84%
In retaliation, the Delta
Force saw on the monitor

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:90%
they had kill him.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:84%
They went down to
retaliate, and the gray

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
ended up killing 66 of them, and
I forget what the numbers are.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it's 44 scientists
and 22 Delta Force.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:84%
That was known as the
altercation at Dulce.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But these ufologists had turned
this into the war at Dulce.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a war.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:90%
It was an accident.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, when Bob
went to work at S4,

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and this is three years later,
after I heard the story,

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:90%
he said, I heard that story.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, he said, the report
I read didn't say Dulce,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
but it might have included
the exact same figures.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible my clearance
wasn't high enough to know,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
because they were advancing as,
you know, he had 150 documents.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do
is they paperclipped

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
or stapled the last
of the pages that he

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:90%
wasn't authorized to read.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when he'd
go the next time,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
he'd see that they'd
taken the staples out

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and give him a few more pages
of these different reports,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:90%
and one of them was at Dulce.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So when he read
it, the altercation

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.392 align:middle line:84%
happened at Area 51, and it
really did happen at Dulce.

00:11:13.392 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What I don't
understand is, because it's not

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
in Bob's job description
to be part of that intel,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
or did everyone over there
at S4 get this message just

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:90%
to let everyone know?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Like let all the employees
know this has happened,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
maybe hear about it.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: That's what I suspect.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
He was told that he would have
to make a decision on what

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.447 align:middle line:84%
aspect of the research
of the saucers

00:11:47.447 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:90%
he would want to be involved in.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Because he couldn't be involved
in more than one, and he

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:90%
picked propulsion.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: So in his getting ready
to choose what part he wanted

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
to be involved in,
they gave him all

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
of these briefings that
were told about all

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
the different aspects about.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: So he could decide
which place he wanted to go in,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and he picked propulsion.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
took him into the room,

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and he was shown that full-sized
operational antimatter reactor.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And right in the room, it was
right there, fully operational,

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and you can imagine
it in a room.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking
at an object that

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
has an antimatter matter in
a little sized cup going on

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Amazing.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: I've tried to
find out exactly what some

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:90%
of the other briefings had.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you know,
stuff like towing asteroids

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
around and stuff like that, but
he never was more forthcoming.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
they doing at Dulce?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: I think it's all
strictly cross breeding

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
humans with dogs and
humans with cattle

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.252 align:middle line:84%
And then the stories of
nightmare hall is true,

00:13:08.252 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:90%
and that's one of the levels.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the seventh
level, where they have

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:90%
all the experiments gone wrong.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But for one reason or another,
they didn't want to kill them.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So whoever goes down there, they
hear the howling and screaming,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's where all those
terrible stories come from.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:84%
When I met Cherry, she
had seen these seven

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.700 align:middle line:84%
black and white photos
but not the videotape.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The security guard
allowed her to make

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
a pencil drawing of the 25
black and white photos, not

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:90%
all of them but some of them.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:10%
And she handed me an 8 1/2 by 11
piece of paper with her pencil

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:10%
drawing of what was
in those photos,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:10%
and I think there was six pages.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:10%
And those are the
ones she asked me

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:10%
to copy in felt tip,
black, which I did,

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:10%
identical to what she had.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:10%
And those I released
to the Dulce papers,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:10%
and they became the
infamous Dulce papers.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I didn't sign
it, because I have no way

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:90%
to prove they were mine.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Except for the fact
that on the Dulce papers

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
there is a page that
went along with it

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:84%
that's printed from my
typewriter, which was an IBM

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Executive, released in 1965.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.745 align:middle line:84%
And their typeface was
only specific to that IBM

00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:23.545 align:middle line:90%
typewriter.

00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
That's when they started
the proportional spacing,

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and I still have that
typewriter out in the garage.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It's called an IBM
Executive, and I

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
had one of the keys specifically
made with a Learjet.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.903 align:middle line:84%
So that you could type it, and
a little Learjet would come on.

00:14:38.903 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So that's how you
signatured the last page.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Yeah.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I love it.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: The typeface proved
that I was the author.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know
how deep Dulce goes?

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Let me think.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a mile to
where the base starts.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: And then there's at
least seven levels under that.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: I've heard that.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back down to
Manzano Mountains again.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Explain to me, you are part
of something to do with that.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Right.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
That was Dr. Lovelace was born
at the Lovelace Clinic, Dr.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Randy Lovelace.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I think he was the
second doctor--

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't junior.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Dr. Randy
Lovelace the Second was

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
a surgeon at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base,

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
in 1947, when Roswell happened.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force asked him
to go to Albuquerque

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and build the Lovelace
Clinic which was essentially

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
just going to be a
plain, operating hospital

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
but had an attachment
underground.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Underground.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Underground to do
the autopsies on the aliens,

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and that was part
of Manzano weapons

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:90%
storage area was right there.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.307 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right there.

00:15:51.307 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:84%
All those big, steel buildings,
across the street there,

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
some are still there,
across from Kirtland.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Absolutely, and I think
I have a copy of the newspaper,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:84%
from 1948, in Albuquerque,
that had pictures

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of when they were building the
Manzano weapons storage area.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:90%
The story-- right.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: All that was
connected, and my dad

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
was on the board of
the Lovelace Clinic,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and Randy Lovelace was on the
board of Lear Incorporated.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So they all fit together,
and it was easy to see.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:84%
There was a place
on Kirtland, you

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
have Sandia which is its
own base within a base,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and that went down a very
long way, over 150 floors.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Oh, really?

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.825 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: I didn't hear that.

00:16:35.825 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And there was an
area on the seventh floor

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:90%
for the maglev transport system.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Yeah.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And there
was also hallways

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that we were not
allowed to go down,

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and they said, oh, these
are the old hallways that

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
go into the city which is
where Lovelace, I think,

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:90%
had his first hospital.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It's right there off of--

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
the same property.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.792 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same property as
the Lovelace hospital right now?

00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Where he lived?

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Where they started the first
Lovelace hospital, where

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:90%
we're doing the autopsies.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: It was the same
in 1960 when I went there.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's got to
be the same place.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.198 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: I haven't been
there for a years.

00:17:16.198 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because these tunnels
go directly from Sandia

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:90%
to there.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So however they brought
them in on the airstrip,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:84%
take them down, and then
taken to these tunnels.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.545 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Now, when he
passed away, in 1967,

00:17:28.545 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in that accident on
Independence Pass--

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, yeah.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: He had four
sons and two daughters,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe, and his four sons
died in the polio epidemic

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.400 align:middle line:84%
in 1954-55, but
the girls made it.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of them took
over his estate,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and she handled
all of his papers

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and will not show anything to
anybody, will not discuss it.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I've tried.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Other people have tried.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I have the name of a guy who's
made his life effort to try

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
and penetrate the
Lovelace Clinic

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff that
happened, and he just

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:90%
can't get past that girl.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
But the way she treats
that information,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
it's obvious that it's
exactly what we think it is.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Have you been inside Area 51?

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: As a matter of
fact, on my Facebook page

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I posted the 28
photos that I took.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
In 1977, there was a
story on TV, channel 8,

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and the way I saw the
story, it said security leak

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:90%
at test site.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And then all it was was a
security leak at test site.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say anything else.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, the head guy at
channel 8 then, head of news,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:84%
was Bob Stolvow, and he's still
head of channel 8 to this day,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.935 align:middle line:90%
if I remember correctly.

00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, call him up, and I
said, how about we have lunch?

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So we had lunch, and I said,
this story of the test site,

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:90%
is that Area 51?

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
He says, yeah, how
do you know about it?

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
trying to do some research.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, it's
going to be all exposed

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of weeks anyway,
because AP and UPI are going in

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
on foot, and they're
going to take pictures.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So I thought,
well, shoot, I want

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:90%
to be the first one in there.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.455 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, I was
working for Bonanza Air

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Lines as a chief pilot.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So on a Monday morning that
we weren't going to fly,

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I got two of the other
pilots and said, come on,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go
on a secret mission.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And we started at, I
think, four o'clock

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
in the morning to drive up there
and drive down that dirt road.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had never been on
that dirt road before,

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:90%
but I knew that it was there.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was in, I
think, April of '77.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:90%
It's in my logbook.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I had
my Lincoln Mark 4

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:90%
that I bought brand new in '74.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
We got to the end
of that road, where

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
it starts to climb
into the mountains,

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and we did the switch backs and
up and up and up under the top.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And then as we crest at
the top, you look down

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
on the lake and the
hangars and everything,

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and we were thinking, holy
smokes, what are we looking at?

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we wound
down the other side,

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and we came to the dry
lake, or to Groom Lake which

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:90%
was wet at that time.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
It was actually water,
because it had been raining.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little guard
shack, obviously not in use,

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:90%
because there's nobody there.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was a chain
going across the road,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:90%
and so we stopped there.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:90%
We didn't cross the chain.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I parked.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:90%
I took my Nikon camera.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.488 align:middle line:84%
I always had two
Nikons-- one with color

00:20:32.488 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:90%
and one of the black and white.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm color blind, so I
don't usually shoot color.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But I do do black and white,
because I'm an expert in that,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and so I shot the
black and white.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I took the shots like this--
one, two, three, four,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
all the way across
from where I was,

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and I still have
that contact sheet.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it was just
one chain across the road?

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:84%
One chain, it was
just chain, no signs?

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: No signs.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
What we saw is the two
guys that were with me say,

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:90%
look at that dust trail.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is coming
out here, and there

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
was two dust trails of somebody
going around the Northwest

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:90%
side of the lake.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to
come around the north

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and come to where the road comes
down through the mountains.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: So they get to the gate.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're just standing there.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:90%
My black Lincoln, brand new.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Only three years
old, got the tripod

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:90%
with the camera set up.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha!

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.680 align:middle line:84%
They stop and the guard is
in the truck and behind me.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
He was letting out another guy,
and so he dropped the chain.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.652 align:middle line:84%
The guy drove out, and he pulled
up the chain and hooks it up,

00:21:40.652 --> 00:21:41.860 align:middle line:90%
and that time he looks at us.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
He goes, what are
you guys doing here?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we're not
supposed to be here?

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, are you kidding me?

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Are you from the news service?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, no,
we just, you know,

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:84%
were stumbling around in the
desert and found this road

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and came here.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, you don't move,
and he called security.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And it took about 15 minutes
for security to come out.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And during that 15
minutes, we told

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:84%
the guy the history of
Groom Lake, and I told him,

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I grew up at Van Nuys
Airport, Lockheed Corporation.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.162 align:middle line:84%
Every Monday had
three constellations

00:22:18.162 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:84%
full of Groom Lake engineers
take off from Burbank

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and fly out the valley
up to Groom Lake.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And Friday afternoon,
these three constellations

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.665 align:middle line:84%
would come in and
land in Burbank.

00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a secret,
on and on and on.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So the other security
guard shows up.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.008 align:middle line:84%
He starts giving
us the riot act.

00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
You guys are in really
a lot of trouble da,

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
da, da, da, da, da, and
the other security guy

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.845 align:middle line:90%
is trying to calm him down.

00:22:43.845 --> 00:22:46.287 align:middle line:84%
He says, Rex, they
know everything.

00:22:46.287 --> 00:22:49.092 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:22:49.092 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, excellent.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: So he said, I'm going
to have to see some ID's and get

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:84%
some numbers here,
and about that time,

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:84%
a twin bonanza with a huge
camera window in the bottom

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:90%
flies over.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And later at a party,
a guy came up to me

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.353 align:middle line:84%
who I'd known for
many years and says,

00:23:07.353 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:84%
hey John, you know who was
flying that airplane that

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:90%
flew over you?

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, who?

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:90%
He said, me.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.893 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:23:12.893 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: He was just
doing surveillance.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Just because
he worked there,

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and he used to fly
the photo airplane

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:90%
to take pictures of us.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So the other security
guard says, OK,

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:90%
here's what's going to happen.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
drive back to Vegas.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell anybody
where you've been.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get a phone call,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to get a briefing,

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going
to get a debriefing.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And just wait for
that phone call.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So we left, and the we flew
our regular Bonanza Air Lines

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:84%
flights which was
Las Vegas to Aspen.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.097 align:middle line:84%
And I never heard another word,
no briefing, no debriefing.

00:23:47.097 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's to intimidate you.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Nothing,
but over the years,

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I've driven up to the
gate several times,

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:84%
which is now before
you crest the mountain.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was the one that
took the famous photo that

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:84%
shows the whole thing
from the mountain.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I love that.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: So that's the
last time I was up there.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So John, we know
about this secret entrance

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.410 align:middle line:90%
there at Area 51.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:90%
What goes on on that airstrip?

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Where do those planes go?

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Where do these
extraterrestrial vehicles go?

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:90%
How big is it down there?

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Area 51?

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, Area 51.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: That's just the one
square, what they call the--

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and Groom Lake is in
there, and their problem

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
was that any secret program,
they only had one runway.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So the problem was
keeping the other people

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that worked at Area
51 from looking

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:90%
at these secret programs.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:90%
That's why they built Sandia.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And 13 miles north of the actual
underground base, there's--

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
on Gold Flats which was
nothing but a dry lake there

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:90%
for a billion years.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
They built to
14,000 foot runways,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and they have a hangar
in the center of those,

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
a long rectangular
hangar that's divided

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in the middle with
a concrete wall.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
put one project on one side,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and they can use
that runway and never

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:84%
be aware of the guys on the
other side using their program,

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and the whole hangar
is sunk 15 feet.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So when they pull the secret
airplanes out of the hangar,

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
nobody with
binoculars or anything

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
can see that airplane until
it goes back out for takeoff.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's the problem
they had at Groom Lake,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:90%
and I wrote a story.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said, I'd sure like
to get a job at Groom Lake.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, you wouldn't.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
oppressive atmosphere.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't learn
anything other

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
than your specific task which
may be to put a bolt in a hole.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And these days, everybody
has to wear the goggles.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.328 align:middle line:84%
You can only see 25
feet in front of you.

00:25:56.328 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
You can't see to the right,
and you can't see the left.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:90%
You can't see up.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.173 align:middle line:84%
You have to wear those goggles,
and you follow the color line

00:26:03.173 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:90%
to where you're going.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the cafeteria
or the hanger or whatever,

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and all you can do is look
down and follow that line.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody sees you
looking up for any reason,

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:90%
you're history.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many people you
think fly in there per day,

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
back in the day, and how
many could it actually house?

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: It used to be
1,900, and they all

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.077 align:middle line:84%
had to be presidential approved,
even though the presidents that

00:26:28.077 --> 00:26:30.855 align:middle line:84%
signed it, he had no
idea who they were.

00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy named
Sam, way back in the '50s,

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:84%
was the main guy at
Groom Lake, and he

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:84%
had to meet every single
person that came to work.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
You had to have a
presidential clearance,

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:90%
and then you had to meet Sam.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And Sam had to talk
to you, so that he

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
knew every single person
that worked at that base.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other projects
go on, John, over at Area 51

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:90%
that you're aware of?

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: I can't
remember any that I

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
know of except for the
story that Jim Godall tells

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:84%
when he was visiting Ben Rich,
and Ben Rich was about to die.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Jim had been up
at the test site,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and they'd heard
this huge noise.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it sounded
like the sky ripping.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: And he told this to Ben
Rich, and Ben said, you know,

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
not everything that makes
noise is an airplane.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: So I don't
know all of it.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What we
know as a community

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and the general public is
just like 30 years old.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Where is it today?

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
If they were doing
that back then,

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:84%
even with the F-19
Stealth Fighter,

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and then imagine what
they really got going on.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Yes.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:84%
We had a guy visit,
Air Force guy,

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:84%
he was going into deep,
deep intelligence.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And he came out here to visit us
and telling us he was going in

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and why he was not ever
going to contact us again,

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:90%
and we started talking.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I've always said that the public
knows 1% of what's going on.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I know 2%.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:90%
I think it's less now.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the public
knows less than 1%,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.420 align:middle line:90%
and I know less than 2%.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
secret stuff going on,
