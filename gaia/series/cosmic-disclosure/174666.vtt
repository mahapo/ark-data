>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.560 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.602 align:middle line:84%
I'm here again with our
special guest, Emery Smith.

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:84%
In this episode we're
going to be getting

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:84%
into extraterrestrial and
human hybridization and some

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:84%
of the very bizarre
research that he was

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:90%
involved in on that subject.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.526 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks, Dave.

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When you have
told us about the work

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that you did with the autopsies
of extraterrestrial bodies,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
it's a very curious
subject for me,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:84%
because obviously these bodies
are coming from somewhere.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But the scope
of how many you yourself

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
autopsied-- you say, including
all the tissue samples

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and everything, 3,000 roughly.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Specimens-- tissue
samples and beings, yeah.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The sheer genetic
diversity of all that material.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the idea
of if lightspeed

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is a barrier for
travel, how could there

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
be so many extraterrestrials
that we would even

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:90%
be able to get our hands on?

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.952 align:middle line:84%
Or is lightspeed not a
barrier to your understanding?

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, light
speed definitely

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
is not a barrier for
extraterrestrials.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
point to correlate

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
with the amount of numbers
of tissue specimen autopsies

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I've done.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And the number of
operating rooms

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
that are down there
that are running 24/7.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the number
of living habitable worlds

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:90%
just in our own solar system.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So the
numbers are not a lot.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We look at it like
it's a lot of numbers.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.385 align:middle line:84%
But as you pointed out
with everything else that's

00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
going on in the
universe, and all

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.301 align:middle line:84%
the different
habitable worlds that's

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:84%
been proven, if you
really think about it,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not a big number for
just one little planet

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to have all these
different specimens.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's not to say
all these specimens came

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:90%
from outer space?

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they came from inside
the Earth in different places.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they did open
up some cavities

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.797 align:middle line:84%
and found different
living things.

00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some things have
been coming through portals

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:84%
as well that we're unaware of
that they've been collecting,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:90%
which is a whole other subject.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
But what's going on is
basically we do know one thing--

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.904 align:middle line:90%
they have specimens.

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking
this DNA, and they're

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
mixing it with human
DNA, and trying

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to make the human
a little bit more

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
powerful, a little
bit more stronger,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and trying to also incorporate
that to a super-soldier program

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to have stronger
bones, you know,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
have a faster thought
process, and these things.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Again, it was
very surprising to me

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking
about you seeing

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
a reptilian type of being
apparently in custody

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:90%
of two people.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:90%
You said it was 10 feet tall.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
But for you at that point in
time, it could just as easily--

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:90%
or maybe more easily--

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.021 align:middle line:84%
have been something
that we grew or we made.

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:84%
You weren't necessarily
convinced you were

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:90%
seeing an extraterrestrial.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:84%
What led to you having
that level of confidence

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
that such a thing could
have even been accomplished?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, number one, just
seeing something like that,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
it's hard for me
to believe too much

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that I see when it's like
that brought out in the open.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually sometimes
done intentionally

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes not.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But after working on
the cell collection job,

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I also later on went into the
super-soldier program where

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:84%
they were mixing hybrid
DNA with human DNA--

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:84%
in Petri dishes of course,
really small level stuff--

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and also the
osseointegration program

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
of mixing tissue into
titanium, and allowing tissue

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to grow inside titanium, and
making our bones stronger.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How does that work?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be
pretty far out stuff.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Titanium you wouldn't
think is going

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to be able to blend with
living tissue, per se.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's
what we all thought.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But with the advent of
new materials out there

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and the nanoparticles of
the surface of the titanium,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:84%
they have now mastered it
and mimicked bone marrow.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
You know bone marrow, when
you cut into your steak

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and you have that
mushy, spongy type?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they have
mimicked that exactly

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:90%
into titanium.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Then they put stem cells,
and growth factors,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and tissue-- bone
cells in there.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And it grows and just
flourishes inside titanium.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the body
accepts it as a natural--

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't resist titanium.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.932 align:middle line:84%
So steel and titanium is
used in surgery all the time.

00:04:57.932 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So they learned this is
going to be a great way

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
to reinforce anyone's
bones, number one,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.979 align:middle line:84%
and to allow them to
withstand a lot more pressure.

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
They were having
problems, of course,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:90%
with the muscles and tendons.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.995 align:middle line:84%
Muscles they can
grow to infinite.

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The tendons were the problem,
because the tenocytes

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
are the hardest thing to grow.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And it couldn't support the
weight of the extra metal,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and the bone, and
the strong muscle.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So then they started looking
into hybridization of DNA

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
with stronger tenocytes
from other living creatures.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, you whizzed
through a lot of stuff

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:90%
really fast there.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to break
this down into chunks.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
First of all, yes, I've
heard about people having

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.680 align:middle line:84%
titanium rod in their leg,
titanium bolts holding

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
their bones together,
that kind of thing.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But are we talking
about something

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that can be introduced
into a healthy living adult

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
or are we talking
about something

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that has to be
manufactured in conjunction

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
with biological
tissue as it grows--

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:90%
so a--

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --designer being?

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.169 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's correct.

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It used to be let's just
reinforce this person, see

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:90%
what happens, which is a very--

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
it's surgical.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a very brutal type thing.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But now with the advent of 3D
printing, organs and tissues,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
all's I need is a
piece of your DNA

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and I can 3D-print
you over nine months

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and have you, your body
and your everything.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Even you will recoup
a lot of your memory

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:90%
because it's stored in the DNA.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm getting at is what
if I put the titanium already

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
into the vat and 3D-printed
you over the titanium with all

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
the articulate cartilage
and metaprogram?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I could program, like
you said, the kind of soldier

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:90%
I want.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're
growing it life adult

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:90%
size from the beginning?

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, normally a
human is going to take 13,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
14 years to reach adult
height, maybe even longer.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how would they
accelerate the gestation growth

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they do that.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Nine to 24 months they
can make a complete body.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And they do that
with the advancement

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
of neurotransmitter
chemicals, and hormones,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and special amino acids
from un-Earth origin

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that allows the
body to regenerate

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:90%
faster and the cells.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.395 align:middle line:84%
The problem they're
having is with the brain;

00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't grow as fast
as everything else.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's the problem with
when we take a pig heart.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.965 align:middle line:84%
The reason we use pig valves
in open-heart surgery--

00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --is because they
grow around the exact same time

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Now if I took a dog
heart and put it in you,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
it would grow so fast
that you would die,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
because their cells
replicate even faster.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So what they are trying to do
is let's find all the species

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, and let's find
out who replicates the fastest,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.437 align:middle line:84%
and let's make it more of
that species than human.

00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And that way that will
be the dominant gene,

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:90%
you know, in that being.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But it will have all those
attributes of great eyesight.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
So they were splicing
hundreds of different genes

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.095 align:middle line:84%
together, which is
very difficult to do.

00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
And they use very
mega supercomputers

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:84%
to do this because of all
the algorithms that are done.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:90%
And they did it from scratch.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they keep adding
extraterrestrial DNA to it

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
DNA that they

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
have found that is
comparable to human DNA

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:90%
as far as the growth rates.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
mentioned the pigs--

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not are
the closest thing to us.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:90%
They have the same growth rate.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So once you get all the
same growth rate on board,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
then you're allowed to
add certain things to them

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and growing conditions to
accelerate the hybridization

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and the growth, and
at different times

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
adding different
chemicals to that

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
being so the brain keeps up
with it, because the brain is

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:90%
the problem.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're
saying that the bone

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:84%
marrow of an entire
skeleton would

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.757 align:middle line:84%
be created almost like a chassis
or framework and then grown?

00:09:32.757 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Or is it more that--

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, you can grow
the bone over the titanium

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:90%
and just reinforce it.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So the titanium
is already there.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
these 3D printers

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.955 align:middle line:84%
that are printing the tissue
into and onto the metal

00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:51.119 align:middle line:90%
or other substances.

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
There's other substances
they use besides--

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm just using
titanium as a basis

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because everyone understands
titanium and osseointegration

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:90%
in the science world.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
substances they're

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:84%
using besides that now
that are more flexible

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and that are more
durable to keep

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
the person, or the soldier,
or the program life form,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
or the clone to last
longer in battle

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
or to last longer on
mission-oriented missions.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if you print up
a being into full adulthood

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
in such a short time-- you
say as little as nine months--

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
does that also lower
its overall lifespan

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't
grown at the slow rate

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:90%
that a human normally would?

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was not in
the project long enough

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:90%
to know about that.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But from what I
heard, that is true

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:45.555 align:middle line:84%
because of the mutations that
happen when you grow cells.

00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.194 align:middle line:84%
If I take your cell--
like a stem cell--

00:10:51.194 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and I grow a bunch
of them, some of them

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a
little whacked-off.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And that could turn
into a mutation.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
found out this happens,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
they embraced it, because
they were now making

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:84%
new species, because
they wanted it to mutate.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And then it got really weird.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So then you were having all
these different species in one

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
mutating and forming
new crazy monsters.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of weird
designs were being

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
made, mixing extraterrestrial
DNA with human DNA,

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.290 align:middle line:84%
with the DNA from
different types

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:84%
of bacteria in the ocean, and
this, and that, and the other.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And it just got out-of-hand.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And you'd see vats and
vats of these beings

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
in stasis that they failed,
like the one I told you about--

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.916 align:middle line:90%
the tiger, the person tiger.

00:11:41.916 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Part
human, part tiger--

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Looked like a--

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --hybrid.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --hybrid, yeah, that
was mutated, unfortunately.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Is it possible that
if you have a being that

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
didn't work out properly
and it's kept in stasis--

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:84%
can that genetic
material be reused?

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:90%
I figured, but it's--

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Excellent question.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.221 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --a little dark.

00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about that.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you're talking
about the actual genetic

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:84%
or the cellular
material of that being--

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --in stasis.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they can do two things.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
They can terminate the being
and liquefy it and then

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
use that amino acids
to do other things.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
They can also extract
the DNA from that

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and save it and come back
to that later if they

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:90%
need a missing something.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And basically adding and
subtracting things from the DNA

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%
is what they're
doing to find out

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
what is going to be
able to work together.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the problem
is everything

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:90%
wants to fight everything.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Just like when we put someone
else's heart in someone else's

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.880 align:middle line:90%
body, there's a rejection--

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --rate So what
they have perfected

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
is getting rid of
all that, getting

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:84%
rid of the antigens and
antibodies that are saying no.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
They are now able to program
the cells to accept it,

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
even though the body
might not last a year.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But at least they will have
a body to do whatever job.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the lifespan, the
fact that it's so compromised,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean
for trying to use

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.785 align:middle line:90%
clones to build a species?

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like this
is messing around

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with something
that doesn't really

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
have the potential to create
any lasting life form.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.276 align:middle line:90%
It's more like just a tinkering.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is a tinkering.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And tinkering gets my lab money.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I make a
breakthrough, I'm

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.470 align:middle line:84%
going to get what I need
for my lab for the next year

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:90%
so I can do even more tinkering.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But once you get to a spot--
which they already have.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're already
making clones.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not a secret.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They're already making
clones and they're

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:90%
storing them in the thousands.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are able to
keep these clones alive

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.634 align:middle line:90%
until they activate them.

00:14:04.634 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And we call these
programmed life form clones.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Not just a regular
clone that they make

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and they use for their
own personal whatever--

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.234 align:middle line:90%
assistant.

00:14:13.234 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
These are clones
that are actually

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.030 align:middle line:90%
going to be used for something.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And I can speculate
only the worst.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I wouldn't want a whole
world full of clones that who

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:84%
knows what's going to happen
if they mutate down the road

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
or how long their
lifespan might be.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So they're probably
going to be used

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:84%
for war, because they're just
an asset that can be destroyed.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.062 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
thing I can think of,

00:14:37.062 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
why they would store

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:84%
so many clones in
one area and then

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
this information leak out
into the private mil labs.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be disinformation,
but it's not--

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:90%
it's actual real information.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And now it's coming
out to the public.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
China is already saying
they'll be growing

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:90%
people for their organs.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It's on national news.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So what's going to
happen when they're 18?

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.134 align:middle line:84%
You just kill them
and take the organ?

00:15:08.134 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen here?

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You're just growing
these people.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.161 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: That's pretty bizarre.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And 33 people die every
day waiting for an organ

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:90%
here, so I get it.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But I don't get it
because those are

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
living creatures, or
living organs, or however

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:90%
they're doing it.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But to say that
we're actually going

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
to make a cloned human to
harvest its organs is pretty--

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's ethically
complicated, to say the least.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It sends
chills up my spine.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Why not just grow
the organ, like we're

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:90%
doing in most places?

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.193 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, why
grow one organ when

00:15:50.193 --> 00:15:51.642 align:middle line:90%
you can grow a whole body?

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's
the way they think.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.832 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:55.832 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
think on some level

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that they're hoping that if they
do enough of this hybridization

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that they will be
able to improve

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:90%
upon whatever we already are?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, they don't
maybe have a spiritual view

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.322 align:middle line:90%
of this being anything perfect.

00:16:12.322 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at it like a
machine that they can upgrade.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That is
absolutely correct.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:84%
They stumble upon things
during these hybridizations.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
They stumble upon things
that they never knew.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
those things I think

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
may make it to the civilian
world to help us heal.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a very
slow and costly thing

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
they make their money--

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
hey, we discovered this
because we were doing this,

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but we just stumbled
upon this just because we

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:90%
were doing this experiment.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll take that
idea, and put it in a box,

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and manufacture it, and sell it.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the
extraterrestrial species

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that Pete Peterson talked about,
he called them the Simulacs.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And they were apparently
a little more simian

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:90%
than humans are.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason,
I guess they had tails--

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:90%
the tails could bend.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.245 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.245 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:84%
They tinkered with their
DNA and made their fingers

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
into these long things that
could curl like a tail.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious if you
ever saw anything

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:90%
like that in your autopsy work.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen feet
that were hands--

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:90%
more like hands than feet.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And these are very
lengthy people,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
very human but long-jawed,
and very white--

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:84%
very white-- and
beautiful blue eyes.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were ectomorphic,
with the long, lean bones.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And they had these big--

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:84%
they weren't feet,
but large hands

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
for feet, and just
like our hands,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:90%
like exactly like our hands.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:90%
But they were feet.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were not
spread out like this.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They were spread
out really wide.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The fingers
would go very wide too.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And a very small
palm for the heel.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
was for the weight.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And their legs were the reverse.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Tibia-fibia was
backwards in the femur.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you switched
your joints around,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.486 align:middle line:84%
it would go the opposite
way, back and up.

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Interesting.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.111 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And when
you say long-jawed,

00:18:36.111 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
do you mean that
the face extended

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:90%
down more than ours would?

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, the
jawline at least an inch.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very thin face.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.987 align:middle line:84%
They were very
attractive beings.

00:18:46.987 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What were the size of
the eyes like compared to ours?

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Big almond eyes,
twice the size of ours.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Smaller nose.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:90%
They had teeth just like ours.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And they had lips.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:90%
That had no eyebrows.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And their ears were
oval and very small.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.887 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So here you
are day after day.

00:19:06.887 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:84%
You said some days
you might have even

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.699 align:middle line:84%
done multiple
specimens in one shift

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
the assignment was.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And we talked in a
previous episode about how

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
other genetic teams--

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
you take a sample
out of the cadaver,

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
you put it through
the wall, other teams

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:90%
start working on it.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So how extensive do you think
this ET human hybridization is?

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: In my own
opinion as of today--

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
because I know when I left
they already accomplished it.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So I know as of today they have
already probably duplicated

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:90%
20, 30 species--

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:84%
cloned the extraterrestrial
species to learn about them.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And they have also mixed
their DNA with our DNA.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure there is at least
20 to 30 hybrid species today

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:90%
that can be confirmed.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's my opinion
and speculation,

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:84%
because I know how many they
had about the time I left

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:90%
that they were successful with.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you mentioned that
the tiger human was one type

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.111 align:middle line:90%
that didn't really work out.

00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: At that time
it did not work out.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But it might have
worked out later

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:90%
if they kept working on it?

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what would
be some other examples

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
of a being that actually had
been successfully hybridized?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
What would we see, just
if you could give me

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:90%
one example to start with?

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there is one
of the avian extraterrestrials

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
that I have met that are
different than Mr. Goode's

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:90%
avians.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And this birdlike human
looked like a pterodactyl.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they're
highly intelligent.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:90%
They're very nice.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:90%
They're very intuitive.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Of course they're telepathic.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't really fly, but
they have very small wings

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.390 align:middle line:90%
on the back like a pterodactyl.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a pterodactyl had
that thin but with a nice mouth

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
underneath in a body,
in a scaly body.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the really
long mouth with the teeth?

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The long face, and
then underneath

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is a small mouth
underneath the jaw.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So they were successful with
making a hybrid one of these.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if they're
doing that because it would

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
remind people of a demon,
or a dragon, or something

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
if they wanted to
use it religiously.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Because definitely would
get a lot of attention

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:84%
if this thing would
walk around downtown,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's an ancient
dinosaur-looking creature.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:90%
But it stands upright.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's scaly.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's green and red scales.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's very large
scales like a fish--

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:90%
really large scales.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Now the back of it
has these ridges

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that go down from--
it starts at the neck

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:84%
all the way down the
spine on both sides.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds me of the back
of a crocodile's or alligator's

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:90%
spinous process.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And you know how they have
all those little spikes

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:90%
on the back?

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure, yeah.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: OK.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So picture that going all
the way down their back

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
into a very, very small
tail near the coccyx bone.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it looked like.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And it
didn't have clothes?

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: What was the height?

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Eight feet.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.888 align:middle line:90%
I think they made him larger.

00:23:01.888 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
make him really big.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But the species itself was
around six to seven feet.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And the hybrid ones were
around 8 to 10 feet.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So for some reason, they were
able to use the human DNA

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:90%
to make these compatible.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
they did it, by the way.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: The species
itself, meaning this

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.957 align:middle line:84%
is not a hybrid of a
human and a pterodactyl.

00:23:26.957 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
This is some sort
of extraterrestrial.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They took the
extraterrestrial pterodactyl

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and cloned it with a human and
they made this other species.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, the pterodactyl
head, obviously it

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:90%
has a long jaw.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:90%
But it also has this--

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --flange on the back.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.076 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Very large
flange, absolutely.

00:23:45.076 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So that was there?

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.127 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Weird.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So that sounds like some of the
Egyptian things that we see.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.054 align:middle line:84%
For example, they
have this staff

00:23:57.054 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:90%
that they're always holding.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And it has what looks like
a pterodactyl head on that.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And I'd always
speculated that might

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:10%
be a pterodactyl that had popped
through a portal or something.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:10%
Do you think that these
pterodactyl-looking beings

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:10%
might have visited the
Egyptians and might

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:10%
have been immortalized
into that staff or?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because of
the head it's a given.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:90%
You kind of know.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It's just like in the Egyptian.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:90%
But that's a speculation.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
That's not my
specialty, the Egyptian.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But just looking at
it, it's a given.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like, my goodness,
this is so similar to what

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:90%
they have over there.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's so ancient too.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:90%
And they may have been here.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I heard a lot in
history about these pterodactyls

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and things being
caught here, and also

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:84%
people visualizing these,
and many different accounts

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:90%
of these beings there.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could we discuss
another example of one

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
of these hybrid beings that was
successful that you got to see?

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned a bird-like
being but that it

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
was a bird-like being
because it was a pterodactyl.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So what would be another
one that would jump out

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:90%
as a peculiar example?

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
not all the beings

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:84%
are phantasmical from
Earth insects and stuff

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:84%
like that, like the
praying mantises and people

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.460 align:middle line:90%
and these other lineages.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But the most fascinating
ones are the ones

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that actually look like
us, the ones that are

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit different.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're a
little bit wider,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%
maybe a little bit taller.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:84%
But they a face, they have
a same digestive system.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're just so much more
advanced than us and conscious.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.274 align:middle line:84%
And their brains are always
larger for some reason.

00:25:57.274 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing
I want to point out

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of the most
intelligent five star you

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:84%
humanoid-type extraterrestrials
is what they really want.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Because for some reason,
it's the most compatible

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:90%
with our DNA.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:90%
I wonder why.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I wonder why.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So with that being
said, any time

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that comes in-- and I've
seen these beings before,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
not only with my experiences on
CSETI, but also in the Milabs

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
they are the easiest to
make a hybrid out of.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they have done.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And they have hundreds
of these hybrids.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So if they can get their hands
on one, then they're set.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.665 align:middle line:90%
It'll work out.

00:26:42.665 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
very successful,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:84%
meaning these beings are
living a very lengthy life.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.605 align:middle line:84%
And because of the very
similar genetic code,

00:26:51.605 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:90%
they're just more advanced.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And they have telepathy.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You know they can do
things that we cannot do.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
They could be used
for good or bad,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
if they would learn
how to program them.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, we've had
several other insiders talk

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:84%
about draco-reptilians
as being a group

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that now with our technology
in the secret programs

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:84%
they might only be 40
years ahead of us in terms

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of where we're going secretly.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, we're now
actually at parity with them

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:90%
in terms of warfare.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So it would appear that our
genetic technology is also

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.970 align:middle line:90%
becoming comparable with them.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So they hybridized
their DNA with humans,

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:90%
and then they act--

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They did.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: --they're our gods--

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --that they get
to control us or something.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How do you see our
understanding of a supreme

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.790 align:middle line:84%
being evolving with this
genetic recombination stuff?

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it really
would make us gods.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what your
interpretation of God is,

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:90%
but I don't believe that at all.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have any
similar DNA or lineage,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that means you
can be compatible.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You can live
peacefully, if you're

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:84%
at the level of that other
civilization is the problem.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for us to get
to that right level, everyone

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's many civilizations
all around the universe that

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:90%
started the same time we did.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're so far beyond us
because they were not held back

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:84%
from free energy
and anti-gravity

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:90%
and were not puppeteered.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And there's going
to be a huge meeting soon

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic Federation.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And they will take 5
leaders from this planet.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And they will tell and bring
them to this galactic court

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:90%
and say, why did you do this?

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to say,
these world leaders, what

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:90%
are you talking about?

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.270 align:middle line:90%
We didn't do anything.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And then in the back behind
them is a giant screen

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.789 align:middle line:84%
protecting everything they know
to the Galactic Federation.

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And they are telling the truth.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they will see that
the 300 major corporations are

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
responsible for the
world's leaders and all

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:84%
the stuff they've done to
all the people of Earth.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.674 align:middle line:84%
So they will come
back and grab them.

00:29:20.674 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're talking about
some kind of potential criminal

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:90%
trial--

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:24.855 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, huge trial.

00:29:24.855 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: --in which
lying is impossible.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's impossible.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You will not be able to lie.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:90%
No one will.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of ethical
complications with trying

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:90%
to create designer species.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think that maybe a
deeper level we could get into

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:84%
is just to say that if
there is a supreme being,

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
it's the genetics
itself that emanates

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And simply combining genetics
doesn't make you a god.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like being
born into royalty

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:90%
or marrying into royalty.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.555 align:middle line:90%
It's still royalty.

00:30:01.555 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.910 align:middle line:84%
They still are going
to accept that person.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So what I'm getting
at is that it's still neutral.
