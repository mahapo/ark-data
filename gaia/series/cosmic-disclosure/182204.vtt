00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.277 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:21.693 align:middle line:10%
My name is Jay
Weidner, and you're

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:10%
watching "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.770 align:middle line:10%
And we are back with Jason Rice.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.570 align:middle line:10%
Hi, Jason.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Hi, Jay.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for having
me on the show again.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah, no problem.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
talk about some encounters

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:90%
that you had with a--

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's an ET race that
you call the hybrid spiders.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
How did you first
encounter these creatures?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, there's
nothing on Earth

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:84%
that's even remotely
close to what they are.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're the size of
a grizzly or polar bear

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:90%
in just their mass.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But they move quickly
and fast like a spider.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that was where the hybrid
spider reference came from.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So, what?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.178 align:middle line:84%
They can change directions like
spiders do, really quickly?

00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Hop, move.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just unbelievable
how quickly

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:90%
they're able to move around.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.077 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Intimidating?

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Very intimidating.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Where did you
see these creatures?

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: These were on
Calidus 3, Planet 2.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
This was the invading enemy
that came and was used

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:90%
to try and destroy the planet.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
The purpose-- again,
trying to reduce

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:90%
the planetary populations.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were they
made or manufactured?

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Are they real?

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were also
lab made somewhere.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They were not a
reproducing species.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
They were androgynous
in that they

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:90%
didn't have any male or female.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
reproductive organs.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:90%
They were built for a purpose.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And that purpose was to
destroy as much as they could

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:90%
on Planet 2.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they
communicate or talk?

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
No communications that we were
able to pick up on or hear.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:84%
The communications we had
surmised that they were--

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
in order to coordinate
their own activities--

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
was based on a hive mind
concept in which there

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:84%
was a controlling command
structure somewhere that

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
fed the information,
and the objectives,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
the different go-orders
that each of the soldiers

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:90%
needed to follow.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How many
of these creatures

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
were there that you
dealt with that you saw?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thousands.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Thousands?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thousands.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Not all at one time, but
over the period of the war.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there were a great,
great many of them.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No offense.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
You're not a super
intimidating-looking guy.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How did you
deal with something

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
so vicious and venomous?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Heavy firepower.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But they--
it looks like they

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:90%
have some kind of body armor.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Their skin
itself was pretty much

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:90%
impervious to small arms fire.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it required a
larger caliber of weapons

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
in order to even just
do any damage to them.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why don't you
describe them for us?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They are a
four-legged creature that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any
visible eyes, which

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
meant that they were able to see
their environment through what

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
we had later
determined was a type

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of ultrasonic interaction
with the environment.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They have big ears?

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nope, no ears.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
No, nothing as far as ears
or eyes that were visible.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.882 align:middle line:90%
They had teeth.

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they're bouncing
sound off of objects

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and then reading it?

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, similar to
what a bat does in order

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:90%
to read its environment.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you witness these
creatures killing humans?

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I did.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I was in enough situations
seeing the carnage

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:90%
that they had delivered.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They generally would attack
in groups of 25 to 50--

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be the standard norm
for a unit of one of these.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And seeing fellow soldiers
being ripped apart

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
was certainly shocking and a
psychological aspect of it.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
When we first encountered
them and having

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
to try and figure out
how best to defeat

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
this particular enemy,
we weren't the first ones

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%
to encounter them.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So we benefited from someone
else's first experiences.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.903 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Somebody on Planet 2?

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Somebody
else on Planet 2.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And so having their experiences
with first encountering

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and learning that these
small arms were ineffective,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and that the larger
caliber rounds were

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
the only means of stopping,
slowing down, or delaying

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:90%
their attacks.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So we were prepared in a
sense, in that we had deployed

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:90%
larger caliber weapons.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did they use weapons?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.778 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Wouldn't that put them
at a serious disadvantage

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:90%
for long-range warfare?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It would.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.478 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
a lot of reasons

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:84%
why they could have improved
their tactics by having

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
But again, getting back
to the main purpose

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
behind this particular
hybrid is that it wasn't

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:90%
designed or created to win.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It was designed and
created to whittle down

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
the number and
population of the planet,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
so that the original
inhabitants would succumb

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to the ultimate control and
all the different requirements

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
that they were being asked--

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
one-world government,
and turning over

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
control of how things were
run, and the different factors

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
that they ultimately wanted
to have on and of this planet.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So were these
creatures autonomous?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:90%
You said they had a hive mind.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
If they were alone, could
they have a natural thinking

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
They had a hive
control structure.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And their individual choices
that each of those soldiers

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:90%
made--

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:84%
they were capable
of self-thought,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and processing, and being able
to do some limited reasoning,

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:90%
They did have a mission.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And that mission
was destruction,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:84%
whether they were part of a
group, or their hive mind,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
or not, or whether they were
in a singleton and left alone.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.013 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did they hide and wait?

00:06:42.013 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of things?

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Or was it always out front?

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was always out front.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was always, hey, Diddle
Diddle, right up the middle.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And given the size of
this particular enemy

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and their tactics, it
really wasn't creative.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't much in the
way of an imagination.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
However, given their size and
how difficult it turned out

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
to be, I'm, of
course, very grateful

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
supreme tacticians.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it would have
made it that much harder.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And do we know who
created these creatures?

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.075 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: These creatures were
also a creation of the Draco.

00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why would
the Draco switch

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.268 align:middle line:84%
from the dog man who have
weapons to the hybrid spiders?

00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a
great question, Jay.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
that I can come up with

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
were availability of
resources and a need

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to create a particular foe
quickly and being able to do it

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that
it wasn't something

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that had been fought against
before to keep us on our toes.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So are these experiments?

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I wouldn't be
surprised if they were.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was the whole
thing an experiment?

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The whole
thing was definitely

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
an experiment in
obtaining control

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:90%
over a planetary sphere.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they had
limited intelligence,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
but enough intelligence
to fight in a battle.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And what were the tactics
that they would use?

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So you say there would
be 25 to 50 of them.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
How many guys were
in your platoon?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:90%
And what would happen?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They utilized
a mass charge.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:90%
That was essentially their--

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They surround you?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If they
could, they would.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Their main tactic was to
spread out on the line

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:84%
and attack through the
lines in which we'd

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%
set up our defenses on.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were they
difficult to shoot,

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
since they were so
adroit at moving?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And their frequent
changing of directions

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:90%
made it a challenge as well.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Our units had set
up so that we were

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
in no less than a
company's strength

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:84%
in which for all of our
defensive positions.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we
encountered them, we

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
were at a minimum
of 75 to 100 people.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So these
were a combination

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:90%
of biology and mechanical?

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
The aliens on planet
2 were definitely

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
a combination of
mechanical machines

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:90%
as well as biological tissues.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So their legs were built
so they could run sideways as

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:90%
well as forward and backward?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they were built so
that they could pivot and turn

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.052 align:middle line:90%
in--

00:09:27.052 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Lightning speed.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Lightning speed in
directions that you just

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't normally associate with
any of the animals or the fauna

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're familiar
with here on Earth.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.273 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Can you be empathetic
with mechanical creatures?

00:09:40.273 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There
wasn't the same kind

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
of feeling that you
would get from a person

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
or from another living
being with a soul.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
My thinking is that the
feelings that I got from them

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:90%
was that it was all machine.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%
There was no soul there.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And so being able to
empathize with your car

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
would be similar to trying to
empathize with one of these.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you learn
anything from these hybrids?

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, we learned enough
about their physiology,

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it that, for a machine

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to be able to target
specific areas that we knew

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:84%
were critical areas that
would have a maximum effect.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
We learned that once they
would form up on a line--

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and then what they would try
to do is push through as a line

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:90%
through our defenses.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And then if they made
it through our defenses,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
they would circle back
around to come at the flanks.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And so we learned tactics.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:84%
We learned battle tactics
in trying to defeat them.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How fast could they run?

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: These enemies could
run anywhere between 50

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'd say 70 miles per
hour, and change direction,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and attain that speed as
well within a step or two

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.405 align:middle line:90%
of making the change.

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So that almost
defies physics in a way.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It does.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Because you can't
take a right turn in your car

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
at 70 miles an hour.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.927 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they were
balanced in some way

00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they
could do these pivots.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had to have had
a internal anti-gravitic field

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:90%
that was generated.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you're looking at
the joints and the strength

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:90%
of those joints.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Even given advanced
metallurgy, they

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.470 align:middle line:84%
weren't strong
enough to withstand

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
the stresses of those kinds of
turns without paying a price.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you guys did autopsies
on dead ones or whatever?

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were done
at the regimental level

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and also back at command and
control, wherever that was.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they back
engineer these guys

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:90%
and try to get the technology?

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The information that
they gave us out in the field

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:11.623 align:middle line:84%
was limited to the best ways
for us to disable or stop them.

00:12:11.623 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were you getting new
information all the time

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:90%
about new ways to stop them?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No?

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they weren't taking
what you were learning out

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:84%
in the field, and enhancing
it, and then bringing it back,

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
so that you were in
a safer position?

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.843 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They weren't
feeding us all

00:12:28.843 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
that they were

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
able to glean from an
autopsy of these hybrids.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:84%
They were able to disseminate
portions of information to us,

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:90%
but it stopped.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And then that was it.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that was all the
information that we had.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:90%
And my thinking is that--

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.045 align:middle line:84%
again, because of the
false flag nature of it,

00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is that they didn't want
to make it too easy.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And they had a certain
number of depopulation

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to attain
before the war was ended.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:08.228 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What would happen if one
of these got loose on Earth?

00:13:08.228 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I imagine
that there would probably

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.620 align:middle line:84%
be a lot of injuries and
deaths as a result of it.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What caliber gun would
you need to drop one of these?

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You could
drop one if you

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
were willing to get close
enough with a 10 gauge.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
If you had correctly placed
12 gauge, you could do it.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A slug.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Any type of birdshot or
scattershot wouldn't do it.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:90%
It would take a slug to do it.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And it would
probably-- a 12

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:84%
gauge would have to
be within a few feet.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Probably.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.893 align:middle line:84%
We ended up using the
equivalent of a 50 caliber.

00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, that
would be more like it.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So that was what our
standard go-to was for these.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they
employ strategies out

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
in the field besides
just running at you?

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They did utilize
cover and concealment

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
once they reached a
distance that was between 20

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:90%
and 50 feet from our lines.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Then all cover and
concealment use was abandoned.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.520 align:middle line:90%
And they would just charge.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were able to set
up spikes or embankments

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
to help delay and slow them
down as well as using trenches.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Later on, similar to what we
had experienced on Planet 1,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:84%
we were able to achieve
permission to use higher energy

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:90%
explosives.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Like plasma rifles?

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, like the anti-matter
bombs again or claymores.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you guys got
so sick of fighting them

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that you just demanded
higher energy weapons?

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Well--

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did that
solve the problem?

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --it was
more a matter of we

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
were running out of
people and options.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it got to a
point that looking back,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
they had reached their quota
on the depopulation numbers

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:90%
that they had wanted to achieve.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And so from that point forward,
the battles were over faster

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.967 align:middle line:90%
and ended sooner.

00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: A lot of
manipulation going on there.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.883 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: A whole bunch of
manipulation planet wide.

00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Did they eat-- these creatures?

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't eat per
se in the sense that they

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't eat people, or
their prisoners, or their--

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't take
prisoners-- but their enemy.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:90%
They didn't eat food.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:38.595 align:middle line:84%
What we did find when we were
able to either destroy all

00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of their soldiers, and
take over their base,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
or to occupy their
base is we found

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
what was the equivalent of base
element that they were fed.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
There's no better
way of putting it.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they
ate at dinner.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
But they did use
base elements as part

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.855 align:middle line:90%
of their energy reserves.

00:16:01.855 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And how
were they powered?

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, did it have--

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Batteries.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --batteries?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.413 align:middle line:90%
Did they have batteries in them?

00:16:05.413 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, essentially.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
It was an organic machine-based
battery that contained energy.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of their own motion
helped to recharge it,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
as well as the input
of base elements

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
was part of their intake,
along with energy.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And their energy also
included a recharging portion

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.695 align:middle line:84%
of their skin from
photons or from the sun.

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a very complex
energy-gathering system

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.960 align:middle line:84%
from the standpoint
of, what would it

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.480 align:middle line:90%
take for us to duplicate that?

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But once you looked at it
and saw how they had done it,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
it was really quite
simple in the way

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:90%
that it had been arranged.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a non-complex,
complex system.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You say they have a base.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Did they go back to the
base after fighting all day?

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: After either being
destroyed down to the last one,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:84%
if they were able to destroy
all of their enemy completely,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:84%
then the ones that could
make it back to base would.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was where they
would recharge and replenish

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.334 align:middle line:90%
their element.

00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:28.209 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why didn't you
just take out the base?

00:17:28.209 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, when we
found them, we did.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The majority of their
bases were underground.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.373 align:middle line:84%
So we, at first glance,
wouldn't be able to see them.

00:17:37.373 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We have
ground-penetrating radar.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We do.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And when we found them, we would
destroy them, but finding them.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How would
you destroy a base?

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We would destroy them
with the combat shuttles that

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
would go in and
light up the area.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there ever any living
organisms around these guys?

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.195 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: As in like ETs?

00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, there was-- we
never found any other organic

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
or biological beings within
the area for the simple reason

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that they destroyed
everything and anything that

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
was within their grasp.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
was within an area

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:90%
that they were operating in--

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:84%
if they could get their
hands on it or their paws,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:90%
they would destroy it.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there must have
been a central operating

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
that was guiding them?

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The only
conclusion that we

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:84%
were able to make-- because
this wasn't intelligence

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:90%
that came from higher.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
As this was not something
that we needed to know,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
apparently-- was that there was
some form of communication that

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
was made through a
long or a vast distance

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to control the hive
complex of each of those bases.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't something
that was local.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, we would have
seen something different.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
We would have discovered
or destroyed in recon

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:84%
or found something
that was outside

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
of the normal underground
base that they'd

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.816 align:middle line:84%
established and never
found anything like that.

00:19:16.816 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Then how do you know
that the Dracos were running it?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Based on the
lack of intelligence,

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the very limited tactics
that they'd employed,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:90%
they were made beings.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
They weren't a naturally
occurring life form.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And they matched the same MO
that we had seen on Planet 1.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is it
possible that people

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:84%
within DARPA or the Pentagon are
developing creatures like this

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
to use in battle right now?

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think
that they've already

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:84%
admitted that they are trying
to create robotic entities that

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:84%
are capable of replacing
soldiers on the battlefield.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And just very recently, DARPA
has announced their success

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
at a neural interface between
a human being and a robot

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.258 align:middle line:84%
specifically for
that soldier purpose.

00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Sounds like
a dangerous world.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, it's a very
slippery slope to go down.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How did the war with
the hybrid spiders end up?

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
What was the outcome?

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
How did you guys finally
accomplish your goal?

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The end of the war
with the hybrid spiders--

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
again, it came down to a
matter of depopulation goal.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to get the
population down to a number

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that they felt was within
the scope of their goals.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, once that happened, it's
like the faucet was turned off.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:90%
And so the battle was over.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the enemy just
one day didn't show up?

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Just didn't come
to play the next day.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they come
from another planet?

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were shuttled
in and dropped off.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:90%
I never saw a shuttle.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, this was intelligence
that we were told.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there a possibility
that they were portaled in?

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a very real possibility.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the hard time that I
have with believing that it was

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
a shuttle, which is
what they had told us,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
was that somebody
would have seen it.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't they shoot it down?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Or why didn't they end and save
us a whole bunch of trouble

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
by taking out the
shuttles before they even

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:84%
had a chance to disgorge their
occupants when they made it

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:90%
to the ground?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So that tends to make me think
that they were portaled in.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And it makes a lot
more sense in that

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
the Navy was keenly interested
in trying to help out.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, why didn't they
shoot down the shuttles?

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.155 align:middle line:90%
And nobody saw them.

00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:84%
These were all
intelligence information

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
that was given to us
from higher command.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So my personal feeling is
that they were portaled in.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.067 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so then
one day you woke up,

00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
more battle to fight.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No more.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so what
did you do after that?

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were
several weeks in which

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:84%
we had waited, and anticipated,
and looked, and hunted,

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:90%
and conducted patrols.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And you would find stragglers
that were still available that

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:90%
still had power left.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And we found those that
had run out of power

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:90%
and just fallen over.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the few weeks in which we
had conducted those operations

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:90%
were--

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:90%
is this really over?

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Is this really the end?

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And once it started
sinking in, it

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.023 align:middle line:84%
was, of course, a
very, very happy day

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to finally realize, OK, I don't
think they're coming back.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they had never gone
that far in between attacks,

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
in between probing, or
even finding a scout

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.695 align:middle line:84%
that was on a mission and being
able to at least get some idea

00:22:52.695 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
or indication
where the base was.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
The stragglers that we ran
across during that time

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:90%
were lost and unguided.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
behave the same way

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:84%
they had when they
were under some type

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
of intelligent control
from their hive.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And part of the process
of closing out the battle

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
included doing a planetary
search for more of them

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
we finished off

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:90%
what we needed to finish off.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the first three
weeks when we were waiting,

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
we had restricted ourselves
to being and operating

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
really close to our bases.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And once that time
period was over,

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
we started expanding, and
spreading out, and going out

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:84%
onto other areas of the
different continents.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, I wasn't involved with
all the continental searches.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But being involved in
the areas that I was in,

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
it was both joyful
that it was over,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
but it was incredibly
disheartening.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Because part of the
scouting involved

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
finding areas, and old cities,
and destruction that you hadn't

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
seen before and just
getting an idea of what

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
kind of widespread
destruction there was.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that period of
scouting, and looking,

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and hunting, essentially,
lasted another month.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And so once that
was done, then it

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:84%
was to transition into
rebuilding, reclaiming

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:90%
the whole post-war operations.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was the point in
which my unit had packed up.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we were not
going to be involved

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
in the rebuilding
of that planet.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed to be at
that time involved with it.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until later that
I came back and actually took

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:84%
part in a majority of the
rebuilding and continuation

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.958 align:middle line:90%
efforts for that society.

00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you come
away with any positives

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
from your experience
with the hybrid spiders?

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'd say that the
positives that I came away with

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
had to do more with the
people and the interactions

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:28.382 align:middle line:84%
with the people staying
positive and not fearing death.

00:25:28.382 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did the people
treat you as heroes

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:90%
after this was all over?

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not necessarily.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:84%
By that point, we had become
parts of their family,

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
albeit we were from
another planet.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:50.731 align:middle line:84%
And so the duality of you're
the hero that helped saved us--

00:25:50.731 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a single
person that wasn't

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.610 align:middle line:90%
touched by the destruction.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would also say wasn't
a single person on the planet

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.640 align:middle line:90%
that didn't--

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't involved in
defending the planet.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
everybody involved in it,

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood of people
saying, hey, you're a savior,

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:90%
becomes more of, hey, we did it.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And we did it, not
you did it as a hero.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing that
I took from that was it

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.135 align:middle line:84%
was an extension of my own
unit, of my own comrades.

00:26:32.135 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: In our history, we have--

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, we have experiences
where a very high-tech military

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.620 align:middle line:90%
will attack a low-tech society.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.372 align:middle line:84%
And frequently, they win,
and sometimes they don't.

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
situation you're talking

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:90%
about here on planet 2--

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:84%
a high-tech group of critters
comes into a low-tech society.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.664 align:middle line:84%
And were you guys there
when the critters arrived?

00:27:00.664 --> 00:27:01.464 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We were.

00:27:01.464 --> 00:27:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You were?

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We were.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You were
anticipating them?

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We were
anticipating them.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The schedule that
they had given us--

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:84%
the enemy wasn't so kind
as to follow our schedule

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:90%
that we had.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they showed up early.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And they also did the
polar bombardments

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to raise the sea
levels and so that they

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.310 align:middle line:90%
could flood out coastal areas.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:90%
That was, again--

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So who did that?

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Who did the bombardment?

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Don't know.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:29.895 align:middle line:90%
I was on the ground.

00:27:29.895 --> 00:27:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, some way, they
were able to coordinate and get

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:90%
that done.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that after the
mass landings had initiated,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:90%
those bombardments stopped.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the intelligence
that we had received

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:84%
were that the Navy was able
to either destroy or avert

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:84%
any further attempts
at doing that.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But again, fitting into the
pattern of the false flags,

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:84%
they weren't interested
in destroying the planet.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They were interested
in population reduction

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to a point where
they got exactly

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and everything that they
wanted in terms of--

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why are the
Draco interested

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:84%
in not getting
rid of the people,

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
but just reducing
their population?

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.136 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The point is slaves.

00:28:23.136 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so did
they become slaves?

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, the process of
rebuilding the civilization--

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:90%
their intention was to--

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
at first, we had our own version
of the prime directive getting

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.590 align:middle line:84%
the planetary
populations to agree.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:44.910 align:middle line:84%
That was what the opening
salvos were meant to do.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, the large,
widespread destruction

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of the opening salvos was to
get their agreement and consent.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, so you successfully
stopped the Dracos

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:90%
from taking over this planet?

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Draco
had wanted to--

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:84%
they had wanted to have the
planetary population invite

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the false flag,
so they get invited in.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Once they're invited
in, they are then

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:24.580 align:middle line:84%
offered the opportunity
for protection services.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And in order to contract
with those protections,

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:35.480 align:middle line:84%
they had to rescind a certain
amount of their freedoms.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And by giving up those
freedoms and agreeing

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:84%
to a single planetary
controlling body, a group,

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and giving them the illusion
that they're involved in it,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:56.070 align:middle line:84%
they now have a population
that is willingly involved

00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
with recreating a controlling
government after the war, a now

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
spacefaring civilization that
is now on track for making

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:84%
large technological
advancements,

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
whereas before, you
take a look at Earth.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
How long has it taken those
parties to get to the point

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.720 align:middle line:90%
where we were in space?

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I want to
thank you, Jason,

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.663 align:middle line:84%
for being on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:26.663 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I thank you,
Jay, for having me.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.350 align:middle line:90%
It's all about full disclosure.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you have been
watching "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I am Jay Weidner and thanks.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.880 align:middle line:90%
