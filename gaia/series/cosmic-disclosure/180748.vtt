[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Jay Weidner here.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:90%
We are talking to Jason Rice.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.663 align:middle line:10%
>> JASON RICE: Thank
you for having me, Jay.

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
>> JAY: Jason, you recently
got regressed hypnotically

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:10%
by hypnotherapist
Georgina Cannon.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:84%
In that regression
session, you remembered

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that you were on a ship
called the Heflem, right?

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.321 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: This is really an
important memory, then,

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:84%
because you're pulling it out
of something that's a mystery

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
During the hypnosis process,
I recalled there being

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
a exposure to those memories.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The segmentation in my
recollections is closed off,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and I remembered
seeing what appeared

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to be a door that was open
and then closed real quickly.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And so being able to get the
Heflem information, which

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I had not recalled
until the hypnosis,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
was fantastic, because the
majority of my memories

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
have been from the
second 20 and back.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the memories
that I've had return

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
from my first 20 and back have
to do with the training leading

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:90%
up to it.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So just briefly,
because you don't have a lot

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
of memories, but can you
describe the inside of that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:90%
ship?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
You said you never
saw the outside,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
but can you give us some
details about the inside

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:90%
that you remember?

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It resembles the
inside of a US Navy ship in that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
it's cramped.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
pipes and utilities

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.465 align:middle line:84%
overhead, bulkheads that
are painted, in this case,

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
you know, lime green, or
they're cream colored.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do they have, like, the
doors that have the wheel that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:90%
turns and seals the door?

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: No, the
doors were automatic.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.204 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: They sealed
automatically.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.869 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sealed automatically.

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So it was,
like, an advanced ship.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Correct.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you got closed off in the
wrong place at the wrong time,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and so be it.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: It should be pointed
out that William Tompkins,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
the insider who recently passed,
he reminds us that they used

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
a Naval technology in the
initial Secret Space Program,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
including submarine technology,
because subs were already

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:90%
sealed off.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So they could be used in
outer space quite quickly.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.257 align:middle line:84%
So looks like you were just in
an advanced version of ships

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:90%
that were out there.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And this would have been
around 1985, '86 timeframe.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Very beginning
of Solar Warden.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
editions of the SSP ships

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
that they would have launched.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.064 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: That's right.

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
You remember what the crew
is like that you served with

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
or what your missions
were, anything?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I don't recall any
of the missions at this time.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I think it gets
into some of that higher self,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
determining what and
when it's appropriate.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The memories that I have
recalled from my training

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:84%
leading up to this
20 and back were

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
based on a lot of
trauma training,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and so being put through
every imaginable kind of death

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that somebody can
go through is part

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:90%
of your training experience.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I have a pretty
strong indication

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that my higher self has
said, OK, it's not time yet.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
The crew that I was working
with were other humans.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall there being--

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:90%
at this time, anyway--

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
aliens or any other EBEs
that I had interacted with.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't mean I didn't.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I haven't
recalled it yet.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: OK.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Fair enough.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's get back to
Planet One, where

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
you were battling these
werewolf creatures,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
and we've learned that you
were involved in something

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
you called Combat Darwinism,
in which both sides were

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:84%
manipulating you and the
enemy for reasons that

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
were political, essentially.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And changing the
culture of the planet so it fit

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
in to the way that
the Cabal operates.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
The Draco were setting
up their own version

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of this planetary Cabal
for their purposes.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's Cabal involvement
on this and other planets

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
was strictly from the
standpoint of they

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
provided soldiers,
ground troops.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
The Mars Germans provided that
the Naval ships, as well as

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:90%
the Naval officers and crew.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Cabal that was
established and set up

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
on these local planets
are what the Draco were

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:84%
using as their proxies, and I
imagine that they were setting

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
them up very similar to
what they had done and have

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:84%
accomplished here as far
as setting up the division

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and being able to create
societies where they have

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
a divided society of elites
that think that they are better

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:84%
than the others and that they
have these rights that exceed

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.869 align:middle line:84%
others and that they can
take advantage of the others.

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: It's interesting.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
The elites still stay within the
boundaries of contract and law,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
even though they're doing
things that are despicable.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
They still have a
law and order setup.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
They're criminals who are
following a code of conduct.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Even among the thieves, they
have their own code of conduct

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:90%
that they have to follow.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that
a lot of that has

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
to do with the guidelines
that are set up for them based

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:84%
on the Dracos' end game and
what they eventually want

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and how they want it done.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
In order for them to have
their power and their illusion

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of control, they have to have
certain guidelines followed,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and so those guidelines
require that their proxies,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
no matter how despicable it
is and the truly evil things

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing, they have
to follow those guidelines.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You've told us at the
Draco are allied with the Mars

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Germans.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Are the Draco also
allied with the Cabal,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and aren't the Mars Germans
and the Cabal enemies?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes and no.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, when it comes time to
having a need for something--

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:90%
the Cabal needed a moon base.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And in order to take over
the Mars Germans' lease,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
they had to provide the two
divisions of ground troops.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that puts them in bed
with each other as allies

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
to an extent, even though
they'd been fighting mercilessly

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
for the previous 50 to 60
years over, you know, Earth.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And so the Germans
manipulated the Cabal,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes, they did.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.976 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Very cleverly.

00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Very cleverly, and
that has been going on since

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
the time that the Mars
Germans established themselves

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica and established
themselves with greater

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
technology and basically
bent the Cabal over a barrel

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and told them the terms that
they were going to accept.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: The Germans are OK with
the Cabal going and conquering

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
these worlds and establishing
their own culture?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They're OK with it,
because the command structure

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.954 align:middle line:84%
is held entirely
by Mars Germans.

00:08:02.954 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Just what they did in
the United States at the end

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:90%
of World War II.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: As part of the
requirement for those two

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
divisions, the 24,000 troops,
none of them are above the rank

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
of major, which means that any
battalion commander is going

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:90%
to be a Mars German.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Any brigade commander,
any of the generals,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
any full colonels, all
of the command staff

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and structure in the Navy,
they're all Mars Germans.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:90%
They call all the shots.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They make all the
command decisions.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
The largest command
that could be

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
held by any of the
Earth humans was

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.966 align:middle line:90%
that of a company commander.

00:08:39.966 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Would it be
fair to say, then,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans are actually
conquering all these planets?

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It could be said that
the Germans are conquering

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:90%
these planets for their bosses.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
They eventually have to pull
out and leave those systems,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and when they leave
those systems,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
they have to leave them with a
certain amount of self-control,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
if you will, in
which they are still

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
controlling those local Cabals.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, this is
what repeated in Vietnam,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
where they go and
they take over,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:84%
they conquer, and
then they leave.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And they leave it up to whoever
is there and left in place

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:84%
as the new proxies of the
Draco under the full command

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and control of their
required contracts

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
in order to meet the
requirements for us

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:90%
to come in and help them.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So is the ultimate game
plan conquering the universe

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.892 align:middle line:90%
by the Dracos or what?

00:09:35.892 --> 00:09:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I believe that that's
what they would like nothing

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:90%
better than to do.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the resources
to do it all at once,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and they have agreements
and galactic treaties

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
that they have to follow until
such point that they have,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in their minds, the strength in
which they can get out of it.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: All right.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll get into an area that you
may not know anything about.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, just say
that you don't, and go on.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: It is apparent to me
that the Draco wants something

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
from us, that we possess
something that they want.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering if,
in all of your adventures

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and all of this, did you ever
come up against the reason

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.890 align:middle line:84%
why the Draco are so interested
in conquering planets

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.642 align:middle line:90%
with humanoids on them?

00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: You know, to answer
your question, you know,

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:84%
what is it that the Draco
are looking to get out

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of the humans?

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We will revisit this
on another episode,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.770 align:middle line:84%
but the short
answer is that there

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
are certain spiritual aspects of
humanity that the Draco covet.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come back to that,
I think, in another episode.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: All right.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's get back to Planet One.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
You've just finished
this first battle.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:84%
You now have intel beyond
any shadow of a doubt

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that you're battling a creature
that is ferocious, dangerous,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're probably demanding
more and higher weapons

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
so that you can defeat
them in this war.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.282 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it's
combat Darwinism,

00:11:08.282 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
so you're not sure what
you're going to actually get,

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:84%
what kind of help you're
actually going to get, right?

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Right.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, part of the Mars
Germans' setup for the command

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
structure and the
training on these units

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
was that they would not
take any trainers that

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
had not been deployed on
planet or in combat zones.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you were
training, that meant

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that you had already survived
one-- at least one deployment.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that was their
requirement and that,

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
if you survived it, then
you were qualified to teach.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we got back
after that first contact,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and we started asking
questions, that

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:84%
came back very quickly that
that was above our pay grade.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask those questions.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Deal with what you've
got using what you have.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Your mission here is
to train these people

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:90%
to defend their planet.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to get permission

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
to use advanced technology.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
get the tools that

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
are sitting right over
there on the other side

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:20.069 align:middle line:84%
of that fence that would make
it easier and save more lives.

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And this was done
because you didn't want

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the locals to find out
about your high weapons.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: That's what they told
us is that they didn't want

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:84%
to disturb or disrupt the normal
progression anymore than we

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
already were by introducing
advanced technologies.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: In a way, that's
actually a good idea.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: It is.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You can really screw up
a people by advancing them too

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It wasn't
the real reason.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.783 align:middle line:84%
It's not the real reason,
but it is a good reason.

00:12:49.783 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: All right.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:90%
So now you're back.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Are you now going
to become a teacher?

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No, no, no.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I stayed there for the
duration of the four years

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:90%
in which we were fighting.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: How many battles were
you involved in on Planet One?

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Countless?

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Countless.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Countless.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Over a period of--

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Did you
ever get hurt badly?

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: 47 months.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Not during this deployment.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I was injured regularly, be it
cuts or scrapes or deep wounds.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
The nano-enhancement
therapies that we

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
were provided allow
for quick regeneration,

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
so the eight or nine
inch gash that I'd

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:84%
received on my right arm for
that first combat experience

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
was already starting to heal
up by the end of that day.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Did it scar?

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.565 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No.

00:13:40.565 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So when you came
back from the 20 and back,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't have had any--

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
The nano-enhancement
therapies made sure of that.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I had scars at other
times that have come back

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that are mysterious, and
where'd they come from?

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Why are they there?

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Really?

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: But some of them have
to do with the amount of time

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
in between when you're injured
and when the healing starts.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.711 align:middle line:84%
And this war you were
involved in for 47 months?

00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Did the war end
at the end of 47 months?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: The end of the war--

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
we defeated the last
of the invading units.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.202 align:middle line:84%
And just like the
prior 47 months,

00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:84%
we weren't sure if
there were going

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to be any more that show up
or any others that, you know,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
leaked through the
Naval blockade.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a wait to see if
there is another one, a wait

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:90%
to see if we had any more.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
At the end of those
47 months, my unit

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:90%
was redeployed to Callidus 3.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.342 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:14:50.342 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: You never knew.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: --I never knew.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that it was
over, because they wouldn't

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:84%
have pulled out my
unit at that time

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to redeploy us to another
planet to start preparations

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
for getting another planet
ready for the invasion.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: This planet, Planet
Number One, when you arrived,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:90%
it was a semi rural--

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
not a lot of big
cities, and cities

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
weren't really highly
developed or anything.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.704 align:middle line:84%
Probably kind of a
nice place to be.

00:15:21.704 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It was a
beautiful place.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And at the end,
what was it like?

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Did it change?

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the people?

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Sadly, it changed
tremendously over those four

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
When we first
arrived, the indigs

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
had a certain amount
of technology.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
As I had mentioned
before, they were

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
able to tap into their
planetary electric grid,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
if you will, and were able to
use some of the electricity

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
from the planet itself for
their building generations.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.780 align:middle line:90%
And so they also had batteries.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They had a form of railroad
that they used between cities.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Most of their work
was done by muscle.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have much in
the way of draft animals.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
They had lived a very simple,
civilized, barter type

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
When it was time
for us to leave,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
there were such large areas
that were just devastated.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Totally devastated.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, from rubble.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a single
continent on the entire planet

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that hadn't been ravaged
by the four years of war.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So when I left that planet,
the people were very changed.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they
were never the same.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:84%
They weren't going to
ever be able to go back

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to a barter style of
life, a civilization that

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:90%
had polytheistic beliefs.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:90%
They were very simple.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They had clan-type arrangements
for most of their governments.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.464 align:middle line:84%
It was very organized, and
everybody seemed to get along.

00:17:17.464 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it
was just one place

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that actually still had weapons
that were in production.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that that was
done because there were plans

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:90%
for the eventual invasion.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a reason behind
it that went back probably

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:90%
decades.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:10%
>> JAY: In the 1930s
in Europe, Mussolini,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:10%
the fascist dictator, decided
that he wanted to change Italy

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:10%
from a semi rural environment
to a highly urban,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:10%
high tech society, and he
used extreme fascist powers

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:10%
to accomplish this
and killed many, many,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:10%
many people in the process,
not to mention helping to start

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:10%
World War II.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And, eventually, at the
end of World War II,

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Italy was indeed
a modern country.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So Mussolini, in
fact, accomplished

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
what he set out to accomplish,
which was to do this.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like the Cabal
is using these same tactics.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Same ones were
used, bringing people in from

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
the agrarian, agricultural based
civilization out in, you know,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
the non developed
parts of the planet.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't die
outright during the war,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:84%
they were brought
into a city, helped.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And the reason would be,
in some ways, the semi rural,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
agrarian culture can
take care of itself.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need anybody.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.432 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd want
to cut that-- if you

00:18:56.432 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
wanted to control people,
you'd want to cut that out.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that true?

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's exactly right.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Part of the process
was bringing them

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:90%
into the fold out of the fields.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So it became more of an
urban type of environment after

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.260 align:middle line:84%
you guys got done
messing everything up.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.246 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes, it did.

00:19:13.246 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
After we were finished
messing everything up,

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:90%
it was more urbanized.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happened on the
Callidus 3, Planet Two,

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:84%
the starts of it
on Planet Three.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: In a lot of ways, you
were being kept in the dark

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
about what you
were really doing.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You figured out a
lot of it later,

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
talking to your buddies and
stuff and comparing notes.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But at this stage on Planet One,
you were probably very confused

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
about what you were
doing, and they kept you

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.420 align:middle line:90%
in that confusion.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Very young,
very idealistic.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:90%
We were there to help save them.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:90%
We were kept in the dark.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:84%
If this information was widely
known throughout the units,

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
they would have had
massive upheaval.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They would have had revolts,
mutinies, quite simply.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:90%
So they kept us in the dark.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we did
ask questions, we

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:84%
were told it was
above our pay grade.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Did anybody ever get out
of line in your military units?

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.864 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What were
the punishments?

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
It would be the Germans,
right, that would be--

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It would be the Germans,
the Mars Germans,

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
meting out any of
the punishments.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
They weren't allowed
to kill us outright.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
We also had protocols that
prevented them from mind wiping

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
us, but that didn't mean
that the Cabal didn't

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
put in place certain protocols
that allowed the Earth units

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:90%
to mind wipe certain things.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And so it would either
fall into a category of, hey,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
were we mind wiped
by our own units?

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Or we'd go through
the normal Uniform

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Code of Military
Justice for punishment,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:84%
no confinement to
quarters, or confinement

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to brig, or cut in pay or
grade, any number of things

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that they would do, or
extra duty, extra details.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: As I mentioned earlier,
one of the punishments that we

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:84%
received for helping the local
civilians during the Area 2 6

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
KEW attack was that we were not
allowed the replacements during

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
the time that we were having
to help clean up the aftermath

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:90%
of that KEW attack.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, the other 60%
of my platoon that was there,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:84%
we all had to put forward
extra effort and extra work,

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:84%
because we were missing the
replacements of the people that

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:90%
had died or were never found.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And that was a punishment.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting new
people until you redeploy

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to the next place, because you
were so interested in helping

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:90%
those effing civilians.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.281 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: KEW is a
Kinetic Energy Weapon.

00:22:07.281 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You're about to be
deployed from this planet,

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:84%
going to Planet Number Two,
where you're going to have some

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:90%
more incredible stories for us.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:84%
But just to finish
up with Planet One,

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't designated Planet
One by anybody but you

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
for the interest of us
being able to understand

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:29.271 align:middle line:90%
where you were.

00:22:29.271 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Keep track of the story.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So on Planet One,
were there anything--

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:84%
besides the battle and the
people, the nice people,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and the ferocious
wolf creatures--

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
were there any interesting
flora and fauna

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that you saw on this planet,
and can you describe some of it?

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Certainly.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I realized quite quickly

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
was that the diversity
of life on that planet,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
as well as the next two, wasn't
nearly like what you see here

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember being really
surprised at that.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't give it
much thought at the time,

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
but looking back now,
I remember seeing

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:90%
that there were near pines.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
There were trees
that were like oak.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
There were trees that
were evergreens, conifers.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
You had, you know, all
the freshwater fish

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:90%
that we'd encountered.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- they
have very similar

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.600 align:middle line:90%
analogs that I've seen here.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there was a lot of life.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Make no mistake.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a barren planet.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:90%
There were no deserts.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:90%
I do you remember that.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
There were large areas that
were completely uninhabited.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:90%
It had arctic regions.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have much life
above the 60 degree level

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:90%
or below the 60 degree level.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of it
was teeming with life.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:84%
It just didn't have as
much diversification

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:84%
as we're used to
seeing here on Earth.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Were animals
quadruped for the most part?

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: They had birds.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:90%
They had quadrupedal animals.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:84%
None of the animals
that I recall

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:90%
were two legged, so bipedal.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do you have a
reason why the animal life

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:90%
wasn't as diverse as it is here?

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: My suspicion is that
because Earth is a unique case,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
a unique Petri dish, in which
you have a lot of competing

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
elements that are trying
to work towards a goal,

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and that goal being, which of
their pet projects is going

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
to generate life that has a
better chance of ascension?

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is a place
where there are

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of competing interests
in creating life or changing

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
or modifying or altering life
here through modification

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:90%
of DNA or bringing life in.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could look at
any number of species that

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:90%
have no historical origins.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they come from?

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
the historical records

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
on, you know, how
did they proceed?

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:90%
How are they progressing?

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like they just popped up.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:90%
They just came out of nowhere.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And so Earth being the
special place that it is--

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:90%
it truly is--

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and that, you know, there were a
number of tests and experiments

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
here to see which of the
lifeforms, be it aquatic

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:52.580 align:middle line:84%
or land or, you know, you name
it, it started a long time ago.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do we know who the
people or creatures that are

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
doing this experiment on
Earth, on the people of Earth?

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: We do.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:84%
We have an idea on who
the different races are,

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
based, again, on some
of the history that they

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
did tell us and teach
us in the training.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You said that the
ultimate goal of the experiment

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth is to create
a creature that can ascend?

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: That has higher
chances of ascension.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And what do
you mean by ascension?

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: A higher spiritual
connection is the way that it

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
was explained to us.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do the Draco
have a soul or spirit?

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I believe
that they once did.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
However, their
involvement with the AI

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
means that they are so heavily
invested in machine or computer

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
type technology that that's
a good question, whether they

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:90%
still do.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they
mostly machine now?

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Do they still have--
do they have a soul?

00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:59.861 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that answer.

00:26:59.861 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So you think the
Draco are mostly machine now.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I think that they're
so infected and infested with AI

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and nanites that the
question can be asked,

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.380 align:middle line:84%
are they really a
biological being,

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
or are they just that
appearance, a shell?

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Wow.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You have the advantage of
having the nanites in you,

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:84%
but the locals didn't have
the nanites in them, I think.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So weren't they at a
distinct disadvantage,

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:90%
fighting alongside you?

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: A huge disadvantage.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there are so
many of them that were lost.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
They could not even come
close to standing up,

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and they were smaller
than us Earth humans.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So, no, they didn't
stand much of a chance

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:84%
at all in hand-to-hand
combat with these werewolves.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Would it be fair to
say that there is a number

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
of experiments that are
probably going on Earth?

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it would be fair
to say that there

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
are a number of experiments
occurring here on this planet.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And each experiment is
trying to accomplish something

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:90%
different, wouldn't you say?

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Each of the races that are
doing their own experimentation,

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on a
certain type of fungus

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
or on a particular
invertebrate species

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.740 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's with the
humans, they each have

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.780 align:middle line:84%
their own agendas and their
own goals for what they want

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and how they want to see
their projects succeed.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And one of these outside
ET groups that's experimenting

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:84%
on Earth is trying to develop a
creature that you said would be

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:90%
able to ascend.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The way it was explained
to us was that--

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and I happen to believe
that this part was not

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:90%
a disinformation campaign--

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and that what
they're wanting to do

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
is to create a life
form that has a stronger

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
spiritual connection
to the creator.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And, in that, they want to be
able to speed up the ascension

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:84%
process, because, you know,
this life that we see here

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
is really one of the lower
ends of the life spectrum,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And so seeing a being
progress through higher levels

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of existence, of consciousness,
is what their goal is.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting to be
able to assist with that.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, humans will look
at that and say, gosh,

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:90%
they're tinkering.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.839 align:middle line:90%
They're definitely tinkering.

00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, how much
tinkering did they do?

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, how much tinkering does
it take to move from a primate

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.830 align:middle line:90%
to modern man?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And so these ETs that
are behind this particular

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.920 align:middle line:90%
experiment must be benevolent.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: That is a
great question, Jay.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And define benevolent.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, does our existing
consciousness and understanding

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
really understand
what their goals are?

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:90%
What are their goals?

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.905 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
what their goals are.

00:30:21.905 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking to help with
this spiritual progression

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.240 align:middle line:90%
because they want to co-opt?

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Do they want to do it
out of just the goodness

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:90%
of their hearts?

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.060 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know that.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that
we won't really

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:84%
find out those answers
until humanity makes

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:90%
its own step to the next level.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Are they benevolent or not?

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe that a
number of them are.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
benevolence is what

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
really comes into
question, because, you

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
know, you ask one person, and
you'll get one definition.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:84%
You ask another person,
you get another definition.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And so is making a
person, you know,

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:84%
more resilient to cold
weather, does that

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.790 align:middle line:90%
mean that they're benevolent?

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Does making a person
more spiritually

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:90%
connected to the creator?

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:90%
And there are losses.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:90%
There are tradeoffs.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:84%
If you increase one
thing, you have to give up

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.070 align:middle line:90%
something in another area.
