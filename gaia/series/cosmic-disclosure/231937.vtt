00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE HERRERA: Skywatcher is
an independent group that's more

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.430 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of getting the
data of non-human intelligence,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.170 align:middle line:84%
such as the craft, in
order to initiate contact.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.030 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
we want to accomplish

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:84%
is having the face to face
interaction with them, if they

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:90%
feel safe enough to do so.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, everybody
can get involved

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.012 align:middle line:90%
if they know how to do it.

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:84%
What I hope is that everybody
takes it serious enough

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to want to be curious to
know how to do it, and know

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:84%
how to do it safely and get the
responses that they need to.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Because in a sense, that's
their own personal disclosure.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH GOLEMBESKE: What's
the next major step in this

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:90%
disclosure process?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:10%
While governments remain guarded
about non-human intelligence,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:10%
smaller independent groups
are already making contact,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:10%
and on their own terms.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:10%
Today, on Cosmic
Disclosure, we're

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:10%
joined by former US Marine
Mike Herrera, who is now

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:10%
an advocate for Skywatcher, an
advanced team exploring psionics

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:10%
and direct interaction with
non-human intelligence.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske,
MUFON field investigator,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:90%
and your guest host.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.777 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Thank you
for having me back on.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.277 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: First of all, thank you
for your service and also thank

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:84%
you for continuing
to come forward.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
This conversation
in particular, I'm

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
really excited about
because Skywatcher

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
is one of the few
things I really think

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.657 align:middle line:84%
could lead to a
public disclosure.

00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start with the
basics for the audience.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is Skywatcher
and how did you in particular

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:90%
get involved?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So Skywatcher is an
independent group, as you said,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that's more along the
lines of getting the data,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
about hard data,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
of non-human intelligence such
as the craft, different types,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:84%
what type of responses can
we gain from what we initiate

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
either through psionic nature,
such as machine calling or man

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:90%
calling.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Machine calling,
being a device that's

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
used to help attract these,
or man calling, which

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.568 align:middle line:84%
is psionics being used in
order to initiate contact.

00:02:06.568 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And just to be clear,
this is a team of former

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.497 align:middle line:84%
government psionic assets
and former special forces?

00:02:12.497 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
As well as scientists, there's
also an independent people

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that are involved with it
that have maybe the research

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
know-how to conduct this.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's just
a bunch of people

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.162 align:middle line:90%
from different walks of life.

00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What is the exact
mission of Skywatcher and how is

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:84%
it different, say, from an
equivalent program within one

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:90%
of these black ops programs?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So this
is more public based.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
This is what we want
to bring to the public.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The black version of
this, if you will,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
more along the lines

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.533 align:middle line:84%
to benefit their own
type of research.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:84%
What we're trying to do is
to disclose that, take it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
from behind the scenes, put
it into the public sphere,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and show people that, yes,
the phenomenon is real.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And this can be initiated
through certain people that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
can make contact to do
so without being hidden.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Do you collaborate
or do you communicate with

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent type programs
within these black ops programs?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So there is a little
bit of collaboration involved.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to
step on anybody's toes.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to basically
just gain the information.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
We've got support from
people behind the scenes

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
to do this kind of work.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
They're giving us their
blessings to do this.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's been fortunate
for them to allow

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.977 align:middle line:84%
this to happen and
basically give us

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
the know-how and the
knowledge to make

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
this in the public sphere
because realistically speaking,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:84%
everybody wants the
same thing to happen.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.862 align:middle line:84%
They want disclosure
to be definite

00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of
the tools that's

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.805 align:middle line:90%
going to help facilitate that.

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So there's not
any friction between?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: There is stuff
I can't really talk about.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But needless to
say, we are doing

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
what we can as best as we can
with the tools and the assets

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.052 align:middle line:84%
that we've got in
order to pull this off.

00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen overnight.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to happen within
the first few years or so.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
What we're trying
to do is essentially

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:84%
get basically hard data,
whether that is for them to land

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:90%
and us facilitate that.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And if that does happen, again,
you could have people come.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
There's so much AI
technology that's

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.275 align:middle line:84%
out there that can really
make or break things,

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's unfortunate
that they're

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
going to gear it towards
something like this.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So people yes,
naturally, may dismiss

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
it, which is the biggest
obstacle that we have.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
government to an extent

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
let us down.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're having
to do this method

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.520 align:middle line:84%
of doing it, bypassing them and
getting the real results in.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
That way, people can actually
see this for themselves.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What specific hard
data are you talking about?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Craft types.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Like identifying craft
types on multiple different

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:90%
instruments like visual, radar?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yes,
all of the above.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Visuals, there's things
that they actually

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
don't appear into,
basically, our visual range

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:90%
of our spectrum.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:90%
They appear through IR.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
They can appear through
infrared, which is--

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's IR.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.717 align:middle line:84%
But typically, even through
thermal, they will appear.

00:04:48.717 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
spectrums that we

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:84%
try to use to basically
gain that information

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and say that, yes,
there is there.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they will appear and
look like an orb at nighttime.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.235 align:middle line:10%
When you have your IR, night
vision, or anything like that,

00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:10%
you can actually see the
things in its entirety.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:10%
>> JOSH: What I want to know
specifically is what are

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.472 align:middle line:10%
the psionic techniques used
to reach out and make contact?

00:05:07.472 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So meditation is one
of the biggest keys that's used.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing
also is the main--

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
main type that they

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
use to initiate the contact
with non-human intelligence.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Remote viewing?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.528 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And can you give a
quick definition of what remote

00:05:22.528 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:90%
viewing is to you?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So remote viewing,
my understanding is that

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
literally getting into a state
of consciousness where you can

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
observe things without
being present there.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.037 align:middle line:84%
So if you want a remote, let's
say a cathedral out in Europe,

00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:36.495 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go
see what that is,

00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:38.787 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability to do
that through remote viewing.

00:05:38.787 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
You can use remote
viewing also as a tool

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to help facilitate contact
with non-human intelligence,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
such as being present in
space somewhere, inviting

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
them to tell them where
you're physically at,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and then them showing up
where you're physically at.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this
with your own eyes.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:90%
You experience this firsthand.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So as far
as I understand,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.682 align:middle line:84%
there's two different ways
your team makes contact.

00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
One is using psionics
and the other

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:90%
is this type of technology.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what
that technology is?

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.723 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: The technology is
what's referred to in the public

00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:09.875 align:middle line:90%
sphere as a dog whistle.

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Dog whistle.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That basically it
emits a certain frequency that

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
can actually attract these
different phenomena to appear.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So when we want to
use results based off

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:84%
of something like
that, as opposed

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.137 align:middle line:84%
to something along the lines
of like a psionic would,

00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to try to figure out
what the stronger results are

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:84%
going to be and what type of
results each field, if you will,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:84%
or each different
type of contact vessel

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to demonstrate
different types of contact

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:90%
or different types of responses.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to
figure out if it's

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:84%
going to be stronger
through a dog whistle

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's more of a
consciousness-associated

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
technology as opposed to
something like a psionic that

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:90%
can tap into that.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So having best of
both worlds to get

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:84%
both different
types of responses

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is what we're logging
the data based off of.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Well, can you be more
specific about what the dog

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.497 align:middle line:90%
whistle actually is?

00:07:03.497 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I can't talk about
that and the only reason why is

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:90%
because it is classified.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't want people
to replicate it and use it

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.845 align:middle line:84%
for hostile means because
it can be made into that.

00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Can you say anything
more about it at all?

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Just the fact
of it's something that can--

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
it's a device that can be used
and emits a certain frequency

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that basically allows
them to respond to us.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Like it's a
warning signal or--

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.932 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No, it's just
something that attracts them.

00:07:27.932 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So the only way I can
really describe it,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:84%
what was getting their attention
in the 1940s is when we were

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
detonating atomic weapons
because you have what's EMP,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.993 align:middle line:90%
which everybody knows.

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
something that's

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
scalar, which is
a lot faster than.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
It's multiples of
the speed of light.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
This does the same
thing without having

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.212 align:middle line:90%
to detonate a nuclear weapon.

00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So from
what I can gather,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
you're saying this is a scalar
technology that's putting out

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:84%
a frequency range
that attracts them?

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow!

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And so it's
safer, I'll put it that way.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
It's something that can get
us the results that we need.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about this device

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.702 align:middle line:84%
is it yields results
every time you use it.

00:08:09.702 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What do
you mean by safer?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So you're not having
to detonate a nuclear weapon

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
or atomic weapon to get
that kind of frequency.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not using
something that's

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
also going to
generate an EMP that's

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
going to disable equipment
or aircraft or you name it.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.358 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
more safe in that regard.

00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:90%
It's safer for everybody.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's safer for them.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we care about is
more of the safety aspect of it,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to--

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Tracking them and
trying to shoot them down?

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Correct, which
has been the speculation.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.512 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people were thinking
that that's what Skywatcher is.

00:08:36.512 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing like that.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:84%
It's more of trying to invite
them in, get them to land,

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:90%
basically tell their story.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
That's really what we
want to accomplish,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:84%
is having the face-to-face
interaction with them

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
if they feel safe
enough to do so.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
There's other factions out
there that know what we're doing

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and are trying to
put a stop to it,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
such as scrambling their
own technologies to make

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
them look like they're non-human
when they're reverse engineered.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is what people see
the conflict in difference.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.805 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
show up, it also

00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
interferes with
what we're trying

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
to do because they
will disappear

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
as far as the non-humans.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And you've
experienced that?

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, really?

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Oh, yeah.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: With the
Skywatcher team?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Not with
the Skywatcher team.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We did this in a
different aspect.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you're experiencing
face-to-face interactions with

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:90%
the phenomenon?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: We have not
experienced that yet.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Every time we try
to get to that point

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
is when either they
don't feel safe

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:84%
or it's something where
usually they keep a distance.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to basically
dissect that information

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
is the hold up

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and how we can
actually get them to do

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
what we're requesting, such
as a face-to-face interaction.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you're trying
to build to a face to face?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Right now you're seeing
them in the distance visually

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.302 align:middle line:84%
or on radar or in some
sort of technology.

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, we got to
figure out what type of rapport

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.968 align:middle line:90%
we got to build within first.

00:09:49.968 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:84%
We got to figure out what's
going to be the emphasis that's

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:84%
going to make them
either feel safe

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to want
to engage face to face.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, yes, we
have to protect ourselves

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:90%
in the same instance.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We have to protect them
in the same instance.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
There are different
groups out there

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to curb this
whole thing from happening

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
this type of interaction

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:90%
to be disclosed.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason,
I have no idea.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think
personally, and I think

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
it's my mission that
allows this to happen,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
that elevates us to a
better understanding.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing
is for certain,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:84%
if you have a civilization
out there that

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
is much older than us, maybe
they saw how we were created.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Maybe they have the
answers of how humanity started.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.657 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was them
that created us.

00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was God.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.362 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
things that could

00:10:33.362 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:90%
be-- that we could ask them.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think, ultimately,
what we need to figure out

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
is to learn about
ourselves before we

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.715 align:middle line:84%
start to go into the
venture to learn about them.

00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, I love this.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
This is like a nonviolent way
of approaching the phenomenon.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.692 align:middle line:84%
Have you made any
steps, do you think,

00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
getting closer to this
face-to-face interaction

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.560 align:middle line:90%
you guys are trying to get?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.102 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Not to my knowledge,
but maybe some other members

00:10:55.102 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of the teams probably
have initiated something,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
or probably had some responses
that I don't know about.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said, I'm
an advocate towards that.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
There's some things
I've done with them,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.603 align:middle line:84%
but I can't say that
I've seen everything,

00:11:07.603 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:90%
No, that's fair.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you walk me through,
how this protocol goes down?

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Step by step, reaching out with
psionics, using the dog whistle,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.812 align:middle line:84%
and then how the
phenomenon manifests

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.270 align:middle line:84%
through your
different instruments?

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.372 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: So yes, we do.

00:11:22.372 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's great that you said
that with instruments.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have different instruments
that can actually log the data.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
We have visuals.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.947 align:middle line:90%
We have audiovisual.

00:11:29.947 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
We have all the stuff that
you could think of that

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:90%
would suit the environment.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.727 align:middle line:84%
We also have things that
psionics can go work in.

00:11:39.727 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's like a Faraday
cage, for example,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.602 align:middle line:84%
that allows them to isolate
so it makes it easier

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
for them to work better to
actually get the results.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So what we're trying
to do is figure out

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.727 align:middle line:84%
what is the best approach
for psionic assets

00:11:50.727 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually
get the same response

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
as a technology that is
more consciousness based.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.423 align:middle line:84%
You have technology-assisted
consciousness

00:11:58.423 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
consciousness-assisted

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.245 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: I get it.

00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That's the
biggest difference.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.257 align:middle line:84%
So what we're trying
to do is figure out

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
what man calling
results are going to be

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and what machine calling
results are going to be.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And right
now they're different?

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:09.837 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes

00:12:09.837 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: What's more successful?

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, ones
more intuitive base.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
more result-driven

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.583 align:middle line:90%
because it works every time.

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So what we're trying to do
is use the intuitive base

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
to actually establish
a connection that's

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
more inviting, as opposed
to using a device that they

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:84%
get curious about, and that's
what gets them to appear.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, that's interesting.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: If that
makes any sense.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So I imagine
what technology you use

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with the psionics
might elicit different crafts

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:90%
appearing.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So if you
just use the tech only,

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:84%
a certain type of
craft may appear.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.465 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No, they all appear,
but what we're trying to do is

00:12:41.465 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:84%
use the psionic assets to make
personal contact with the beings

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
inside, as opposed to
attracting them with a device,

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:90%
which just gets their attention.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.930 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't engage any specifics.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.377 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like if
you were to have a--

00:12:53.377 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
let's say, for example, you're
talking about fighter jets that

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.958 align:middle line:84%
are trying to make unmanned
that have-- they have

00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of how
things work because it's

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.417 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence or
it's something that's unmanned.

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The difference is it
doesn't understand

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
what a judgment call would be.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.398 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to have a
fighter pilot, for example,

00:13:13.398 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that can make different
judgment calls that

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
are more intuitive-based,
that are not just

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:84%
programmed parameters
that react off of certain

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:90%
if it appears this way.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.263 align:middle line:84%
Well, AI could say, this
is not our airspace,

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
or it could say that
it is our airspace.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But then the fighter
pilot's going

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.995 align:middle line:84%
to know because it has
an intuitive based off

00:13:29.995 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:90%
of what that person's learned.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It knows certain
things it recognizes

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:90%
based off a terrain following.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Maybe the technology
can do the same thing.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.042 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, let's say
if it's a civilian aircraft,

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it might
be a civilian who

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:84%
bought a fighter jet,
that's wealthy enough,

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:90%
and they go flying somewhere.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Is the artificial
intelligence going

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.140 align:middle line:84%
to know that that's
an enemy combatant,

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or is it going to know that
it's going to be a civilian?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.868 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference
between somebody

00:13:53.868 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:90%
who can make the judgment call.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no armament on it.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not painted
military or the fact

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
is they got in touch
with the person

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to understand that it's
not a military aircraft.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to use the
same type of principle

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.818 align:middle line:84%
of using the person to make that
judgment call to figure out what

00:14:08.818 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
it is we're trying to contact,
as opposed to a machine that's

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
just trying to do it for us,
just to generate the result.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:90%
This gets them to appear.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.218 align:middle line:84%
We use the psionics to make
connections to invite them in.

00:14:21.218 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Does that make any sense?

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: No, that
makes perfect sense.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm curious about what
is that connection actually

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.877 align:middle line:84%
like between the
psionic and the craft?

00:14:27.877 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any information
on that or any stories

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
where people made
that connection?

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So that connection
in itself is like how you and I

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
are talking, but it's
through consciousness.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:90%
That's how they operate.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Non-verbal, though?

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.165 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Or like a connection.

00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:40.998 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:14:40.998 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What does
that feel like?

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Very strong.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Feels like some emotional type
of connection in your chest.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I've had experiences
with this making contact, that

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
was one of the things that
was very, very, very different

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that you could
really feel that connection.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:10%
>> JOSH: Now, Jake Barber
explained it as this

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:10%
feminine-like presence, and it
made him extremely emotional.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And he felt this divine
connection, in a way.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Was it like that
powerful for you as well?

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.983 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, for him,
it almost made him crash that

00:15:10.983 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:90%
helicopter.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.747 align:middle line:90%
It was that strong.

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: I remember.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was the
same thing with this.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.507 align:middle line:84%
That's what he
personally told me.

00:15:16.507 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's a very deep,
very strong connection

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's very powerful.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you know
the difference between when

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
you have a technology
out there that

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:84%
is piloted by non-human
intelligence as opposed

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to piloted by a
pilot that's using

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
reverse-engineered
aircraft, that it functions

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:90%
the same way as a UAP.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
It can do very much
the similar things.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
is when we can

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
detect a non-human
intelligence following

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:90%
that, we get the connection.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.632 align:middle line:84%
When we have something that's
there that has no connection,

00:15:47.632 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that is how we determine that is
a man-made or reverse-engineered

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.413 align:middle line:90%
type of object.

00:15:51.413 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: When you experience
your first connection moment,

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:90%
how did that impact you?

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Oh, god, it was
very strong, very emotional.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
It was something where there
was a sense of familiarity,

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:90%
if that--

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.663 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, really?

00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
If that makes sense,
it's a warm connection.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not like something
where like I felt threatened.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
just felt very genuine.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And it felt something
that was very reassuring.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It felt very safe.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Did it feel feminine?

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Not necessarily.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:90%
It felt like it was--

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I don't
mean like a female.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.958 align:middle line:90%
I just meant feminine energy.

00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: No, no, no.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.415 align:middle line:84%
So when he was talking
about that was more

00:16:28.415 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
the safety aspect or we didn't
feel like it was harmful.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:90%
It just felt very loving to him.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
There were instances I've had
where I had the same feeling.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was strong, but it wasn't
like that in that experience.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Because he had
control of the craft

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
based off the helicopter that he
was towing this thing basically

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:90%
to a facility.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And that's when
it was making the connection

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:90%
because it's right there.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
When we're making-- when I made
connections with these things,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:90%
they're off in the distance.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:90%
They're out in the sky.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:90%
They may be a couple miles away.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
This thing was actually
really close to him,

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
probably hundreds or so
feet from the tow line

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that they're using to basically
lift this craft up and take it

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:90%
to that facility.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So it was a much
stronger connection--

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: For him, yes.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, interesting.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was more personal
interaction as opposed to just

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
being something that's
off in the distance,

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.450 align:middle line:90%
if that makes any sense.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: No, yeah, totally.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.177 align:middle line:84%
I imagine, too, after
you had that experience,

00:17:20.177 --> 00:17:22.499 align:middle line:84%
it had an impact on your
life, and your purpose?

00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Mm-hm.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that further me to even

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
get involved more to try
to get this issue solved.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow!

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Because I think--
because the truth is everybody

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.442 align:middle line:84%
can get involved if
they know how to do it.

00:17:34.442 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
What I hope is that everybody
takes it serious enough

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to want to be curious to
know how to do it, and know

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
how to do it safely, and get
the responses that they need to.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Because in a sense, that's
their own personal disclosure.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:10%
Disclosure, for me, is
what happened in 2009

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:10%
when we had-- when I saw the
technology being utilized,

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:10%
that was something that, for me,
confirmed two things that day.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.420 align:middle line:10%
That we possess this
kind of technology

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:10%
and we're utilizing it, but
we got it from something.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:10%
What we got it from
was NHI, obviously,

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.657 align:middle line:10%
whether it was
reverse-engineered technology

00:18:04.657 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:10%
or whether it was technology
that was incorporated

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.115 align:middle line:10%
with non-human intelligence
type of technology integrated

00:18:09.115 --> 00:18:10.572 align:middle line:10%
into that specific craft.

00:18:10.572 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:10%
>> JOSH: You're talking
about the event in Indonesia?

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:10%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you just mentioned
that this experience of contact

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:90%
felt familiar to you.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
What do you exactly
mean by that?

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: My personal
understanding is just what I

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
felt with myself was that maybe
this is one that I've contacted

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
several times doing
this approach.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the same being.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.297 align:middle line:90%
It may be the same craft.

00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Because what people
have to understand

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:84%
is that the craft itself also
has a consciousness to it.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
This is how the
non-humans are actually

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
able to interface with it, to
pilot it, and to control it.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
have speculated,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.737 align:middle line:84%
I can't verify whether
this is actual or not,

00:18:47.737 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:84%
is that they said there's
no control panels,

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.637 align:middle line:90%
there's no joysticks.

00:18:50.637 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
That you have to pilot
something like an aircraft,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, has a joystick
that we can manipulate

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to get the airplane to
respond that we need to

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:90%
or the helicopter.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
They are doing this through
their consciousness,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.613 align:middle line:84%
through their means of how
they are able to do that,

00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:90%
to interface with the craft.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.613 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
manipulate it physically.

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:90%
It's just through consciousness.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow!

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But when you say familiar,
like the first time

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.150 align:middle line:84%
it felt familiar to you,
or repeated attempts--

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Repeated
attempts felt familiar.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: But the first time it
was like an unusual connection

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:90%
you never felt before?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes, Correct.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Thanks for
clarifying that.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And then I know I've
heard many times that crafts are

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.122 align:middle line:90%
conscious as well.

00:19:23.122 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
connecting to them,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.997 align:middle line:84%
do you feel like
you're connecting

00:19:25.997 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
to the craft itself, or the
occupants inside of it, or both?

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Or are some of these craft
probably don't have occupants?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.688 align:middle line:84%
They're probably like
autonomous drone type machines.

00:19:34.688 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: There are reports
that that has happened.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact that
some of the psionics,

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.380 align:middle line:84%
including me making contact,
so they can pilot a UAP.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.797 align:middle line:84%
They can connect to it and
pilot it and move it over here.

00:19:47.797 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: That's one of
the craziest things--

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: What we're trying
to do is use that same type

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:84%
of principle to get it to land,
but we're not trying to take

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:90%
them down in a hostile manner.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
get them to land.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
That way we can
establish a connection.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:84%
The concern is we're not
trying to hijack a craft

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and pilot for them
where they have

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
no control so we land them
and then basically have

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.230 align:middle line:90%
that connection.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We want this to be more
of a diplomatic approach.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to invoke any
kind of hostility towards them.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's weird to say this
because living in a normal life,

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:84%
you can't have this
conversation with people

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.747 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
you can pilot a UAP.

00:20:27.747 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: I've tried.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.655 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Oh, yeah.

00:20:29.655 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:84%
But these psionics, they
know how to do that.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I am overly
fascinated with this aspect

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:90%
of the phenomenon.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you say the psionics
reach out and connect

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
with the craft and
are able to pilot it,

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is the craft and the occupants
letting the psionic take control

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
as a diplomatic kind of like,
hey, we see you down there.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'll let you control
the craft because we

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.280 align:middle line:90%
know you have these skills.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:90%
What is going on there exactly?

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you even know?

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That's
exactly what's happening.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, well, I nailed it.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It is a
diplomatic approach.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to be
careful because we don't want

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:84%
their interpretation
to be that we're trying

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:90%
to take the craft from them.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:90%
We're not trying to do that.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get them
to land and appear and have

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
a diplomatic approach
and ultimately

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:84%
have a face-to-face
interaction with them, which

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:90%
is what we're trying to do.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
We get that result,
that is world breaking.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, it's historic.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now, my
understanding in the programs is

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:84%
that they are doing
that same result.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing it in some
ways where there is a diplomatic

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.887 align:middle line:84%
approach and it depends on the
type of faction that's involved.

00:21:30.887 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the faction
that gets involved

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:90%
that wants their technology.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So they will either
hijack it to where

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:84%
they move it to a
certain direction,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and they use a directed-energy
weapon at them to take it down.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So they almost trick
them for a second to be like,

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're being friendly because
I don't imagine they could

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:90%
actually hijack the craft.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, the psionics
used in the programs are having

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
a genuine connection
with that being.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that they are
taking that UAP, piloting it

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
over to a certain area.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:10%
Now, granted, these
P3, is what they're

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:10%
referred to as, they're also
under some sort of drug cocktail

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:10%
that allows them to
work more efficiently.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a little
bit more dangerous.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It gets the results every time
that they have this operation

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.140 align:middle line:90%
unfold behind the scenes.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.457 align:middle line:84%
They always get results
over the range, for example.

00:22:15.457 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, really?

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.853 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now, it doesn't
happen every time where they

00:22:18.853 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
target one of these
and shoot them down.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.895 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
specifics of it.

00:22:21.895 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's because the
same craft they already have.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the same being or
whatever it might be

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:90%
so they're like, OK, let it go.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.602 align:middle line:90%
We already have a lot of these.

00:22:28.602 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Or there's another ship that
they don't have access to

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.553 align:middle line:84%
or some type of
technology, and that's

00:22:33.553 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:84%
where they make the
decision to shoot it down.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.225 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:36.225 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Got it.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.103 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: But the
misinformation floating around

00:22:39.103 --> 00:22:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Skywatcher is they think that
that's what's they're doing,

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's not what
they're doing at all.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We're doing this in
a peaceful approach,

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:84%
such as wanting a diplomatic
approach without having to use

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:90%
any kind of weapon systems.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I will say this, there
are some agencies involved,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.457 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to name them
because I'm not allowed to.

00:22:56.457 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that
they're alongside us.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
If we were to utilize
any kind of threats

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
towards non-human
intelligence or use

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.970 align:middle line:84%
any kind of exotic
technology to take them down,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
we would be in trouble
by these agencies doing

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:90%
that because it is illegal.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: But they're doing it?

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yep.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: But it's legal for you
to do it because you're outside

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:90%
the program.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.933 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:23:15.933 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Does the US military
currently possess or use similar

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.818 align:middle line:90%
technology to what you're using?

00:23:20.818 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: To an extent.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not the military.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:84%
It's interwoven into
these black programs.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So yes, military to an
extent has control over it,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's more the privatized
contracting aspect

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.047 align:middle line:90%
of the military that does.

00:23:32.047 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: But the dog whistle,
is that coming from the military

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
or is that something you
guys developed or Skywatcher

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:90%
developed?

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I don't
know who developed that.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, really?

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, they won't
tell me and it's probably

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:90%
for good reason.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.708 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like somebody
stole it from a program

00:23:43.708 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're utilizing it.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
somebody engineered

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:90%
to get the same results.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
What the black
programs have, they

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:84%
get results every single
time, such as getting craft

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to appear over the range,
three-dimensional, by the way.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
get the results.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
They get the best results
that you could ever want.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get the
same type of results

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:90%
not being involved with that.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we do pull people
that are from the programs

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to work on that because
they get the results

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and they have the understanding.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to get
people in the government,

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
the current government,

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.213 align:middle line:84%
let's say, to get
the same results,

00:24:18.213 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
well, they don't know what to
look for because they're not

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:84%
exposed to this and they
have no idea how it's done.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So we can't hire--
it's almost like the same thing

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:84%
if we were to try to criminalize
all of this going on and all

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden these
programs get shut down.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So we end up transferring
over to the government,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.487 align:middle line:84%
and nobody knows how
this works on their side.

00:24:38.487 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So why are we going
to have to entrust

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.742 align:middle line:84%
that kind of
responsibility to people

00:24:41.742 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that don't know
what they're doing,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the people that
already do know how this works,

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.363 align:middle line:84%
and how it functions,
and how to utilize it,

00:24:47.363 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:90%
and how to get the results?

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So just to be clear,
what the black ops programs have

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
is different technology from
what Skywatcher is using or is

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:90%
there some overlap?

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.025 align:middle line:84%
Well, the psionics
are an overlap.

00:24:58.025 --> 00:24:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: But the tech, the
actual tech is different.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, one is more
sophisticated because

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of the reverse-engineered
technology

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that they've been able
to incorporate into it,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
such as getting the psionics to
utilize that type of technology

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to help further
that in conjunction

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.840 align:middle line:90%
with the drug cocktails.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And whatever these
black op programs are using is

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:84%
able to get up close
three-dimensional--

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: --bigger craft?

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now, from what I
understand, the black programs,

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.428 align:middle line:90%
yes, it is three dimensional.

00:25:26.428 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
They can get them to appear
over the range, which

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:84%
is how they can target
them when they choose to.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, I don't know
what the grounds are for them

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to target specific craft.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
that, but it is--

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.848 align:middle line:84%
they get results all the
time with what you want.

00:25:40.848 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to replicate
the same thing without having

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to take the harshest approaches,
such as the drug cocktails

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and having more
willing people to want

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.757 align:middle line:84%
to do this as opposed to
the people that are, yes,

00:25:51.757 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:84%
they want to do it and
they enjoy their job.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But we're trying to get this
more in the public sphere

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.880 align:middle line:84%
without having the
secrecy involved.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:84%
The only secrecy
we have involved,

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
one is our security
measures because we

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:84%
have to make sure
everything is safe.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:84%
We have to have classified
areas that we operate in

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.130 align:middle line:84%
because we just don't want
anybody coming up to us

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:90%
and disturbing the operations.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:84%
We want to have this
separated from people

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.898 align:middle line:90%
so we can get the results.

00:26:13.898 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why we operate
in a classified setting.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.308 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows where
it's at, and that's

00:26:18.308 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
why we keep moving
to different parts

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:84%
because it keeps the safety
for everybody involved much

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
better, safety for the psionics,
safety for the non-humans,

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.355 align:middle line:84%
safety for anybody
that's involved.

00:26:32.355 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.147 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah, no, I
appreciate that actually.

00:26:35.147 --> 00:26:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So in your encounters, I
know a lot of the sightings

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:90%
are not visual.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But in your personal
experiences, what type of craft

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:84%
have you either seen visually
or picked up on radar?

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.227 align:middle line:84%
I know there's Tic Tac,
jellyfish, chevron.

00:26:48.227 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:90%
There's nine different examples.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Manta all that.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What have
you experienced?

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, the most
common one was a disk shape.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was a gold
disk is what it looked like.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
common I've ever seen.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: You saw that?

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: With your
eyes, without?

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:90%
That's my personal interactions.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I've also seen orange orbs are
the most common ones that I've

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:90%
I've seen some red orbs.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.243 align:middle line:90%
I've seen some white orbs.

00:27:08.243 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I've seen some blue orbs.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So like I said,
some of the orbs,

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.455 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at it
with your own eyes.

00:27:13.455 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what they look like.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.310 align:middle line:84%
If you were to have
thermals or IR,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
you may see something
in its entirety.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it appears different
through the different spectrums

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Is this a better
experience during the day

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:90%
or at night?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.625 align:middle line:84%
I imagine the orbs
are better at night.

00:27:28.625 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But during the day, I'd
love to see a golden disk.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, so yeah, so
daytime you can actually make

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
the entirety out without having
to use the IR to do that.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why Skywatcher
has been good.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.693 align:middle line:84%
When they utilize--
so nighttime,

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:84%
yes, you can get different
shapes that appear,

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:90%
different anomalies.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.778 align:middle line:84%
But during the daytime, you
can see a much different type

00:27:47.778 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
of objects, like the
jellyfish that you mentioned

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or like the chevron, like
the manta, like any of those.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see
the shape in daytime.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How big was
this disk you saw?

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys know?

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was often a
good distance so I can't give

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:84%
an exact measurement, especially
because when it appeared it

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.140 align:middle line:90%
wasn't there for minutes.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It was there for a couple
seconds and it went.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, yeah.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: It vanished.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's it.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've had, obviously,
these incredible experiences.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.972 align:middle line:84%
Have you started to share these
with Congress maybe in a SCIF?

00:28:13.972 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: You have.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Some of them have.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.852 align:middle line:84%
And this was last year
with some of the results

00:28:18.852 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and obviously where
some of this happens.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But some of them,
again, it just depends

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
on what their personal beliefs
are, which gets frustrating.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Because some of them are, oh,
I don't believe any of this.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, they've
had experiences of their own.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Who's some of them?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.477 align:middle line:90%
Who are in these SCIFs?

00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I can't mention
in the SCIF because of the--

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
one, I can't name
who I've talked to.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: It can't be general
like it was Congress or it was

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:90%
the military?

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It was Congress,
I'll put it that way.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, good.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Do you think the
current push for disclosure

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
or to reveal more about UAPs and
these black projects is sincere

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:84%
coming from Congress, or do you
think there's maybe multiple

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:54.985 align:middle line:90%
agendas going on?

00:28:54.985 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: It's a mixture.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: It's a mixture?

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
genuine who want this.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
They want the
answers themselves.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.462 align:middle line:84%
We've invited people
to partake in that.

00:29:03.462 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason
they choose not

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to because this subject is still
stigmatized for some reason.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.993 align:middle line:90%
And it shouldn't be.

00:29:10.993 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to make this common
knowledge and common occurrence

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.010 align:middle line:90%
for people to understand.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing, everybody
has a notion of if I see it,

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:90%
then I'll believe it.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe
it and you'll see it.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with
obtaining material wealth.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
If you believe and
you can visualize

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.445 align:middle line:84%
and you want what
you want to do,

00:29:30.445 --> 00:29:33.445 align:middle line:84%
you can be very successful
with manifesting it

00:29:33.445 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:84%
based off the visions that
you create for yourself.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the same type with this.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So if people put the
understanding that, yes,

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.480 align:middle line:90%
if you want to--

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:90%
it's like going to the gym.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe I can bench
press this weight.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does it take?

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It takes you putting repetitions
to get to that point.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with meditation.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
even with academics.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with business.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It's no different.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
People just have
to focus and put

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:84%
what their intention
is going to be.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And if they want this
to happen, meaning

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
they go under the
stars, meditate,

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
get into that state
of consciousness,

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
ask for that invitation,
that connection,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:84%
they get the results,
they would get it.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:84%
They just have to put their
personal differences aside.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What are the different
factions and groups involved

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
in disclosure right now and how
do their goals or agendas differ

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.300 align:middle line:90%
from each other?

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, unfortunately,
the problem is some

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of the factions or some of
the groups are more focused

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:84%
on trying to get
revenue, money off of it.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Of course.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.897 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: We're not
trying to do that.

00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:38.890 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get the
results to show to the public

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:90%
that people can do this.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Two, you have a group out there
that's not shielded by any

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:84%
organization that says
you cannot do this.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
That is what makes
us unique because we

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:90%
want this data to be out.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We want the phenomena to be more
of a household type of thought,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
if that makes sense, that people
understand that we're not alone.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.737 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And that there's
technologies involved to help

00:31:01.737 --> 00:31:03.070 align:middle line:90%
facilitate that.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to be the
forefront of disclosure

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
to essentially make contact
on a face-to-face basis

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.060 align:middle line:84%
with some type of entity or
some type of civilization.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And I appreciate
you and Skywatcher so much

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:90%
in your mission.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Somebody
has to do it.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And we have
the ability to do so.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to try
to refine those skills so

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
that way we can get that
result. And hopefully,

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.090 align:middle line:84%
if we do achieve that result,
everybody will know about it.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And it will be
sincere and it will

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
come from a place
of wanting everybody

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to unite in that
way as humanity.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:84%
They talk about Neil Armstrong
having the first step

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:90%
on the moon, the first step.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.565 align:middle line:90%
Everybody says that.

00:31:42.565 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
do the same thing

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.883 align:middle line:84%
with non-human intelligence
in a peaceful way.

00:31:45.883 --> 00:31:46.925 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, I love that.

00:31:46.925 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Even though this
has happened throughout history

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.938 align:middle line:84%
in certain instances,
which some people,

00:31:51.938 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:84%
it's rumored that President
Eisenhower at that time had

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.537 align:middle line:84%
face-to-face meetings
with some of these beings.

00:31:56.537 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't confirm that
because I wasn't there.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
anybody who was there.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But I know for a fact that
what we're trying to do

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and trying to be an open
book to an extent of allowing

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.422 align:middle line:84%
this to happen, that's
what our goal is.

00:32:08.422 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And I think it's
important that a part

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of the team is a bunch of
ex-special forces because you

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:84%
guys aren't going to be
intimidated very easily,

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I imagine.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No, if something
happens, we're ready.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.330 align:middle line:84%
We're ready to defend or
whatever we have to do.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just there's
always got to be

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.940 align:middle line:84%
security involved because
it's sensitive, of course.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:84%
But two, we don't need people
coming and trying to figure out

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:84%
where we're at and then trying
to get involved and trying to--

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:84%
it's just you got
people trying to go up

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.740 align:middle line:84%
to Nevada Testing
and Training Range

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:84%
or what people call as
Groom Lake or Area 51.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.650 align:middle line:90%
They're curious.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I understand why
they're curious.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm a curious person,
too, but I understand

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.360 align:middle line:84%
the differences between you
can be curious from a distance,

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
not meddling with anybody's
work that could compromise

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:90%
what they're trying to do.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So I understand from both
aspects of keeping the security,

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:84%
but also as a
curiosity mindset, too.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: All right,
Mike, big question.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:84%
From your perspective,
what's the next major step

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:90%
in this disclosure process?

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, it's
difficult. Right now,

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.450 align:middle line:84%
we need everybody to
put their swords away.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:84%
We need people to come
together for this.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:10%
We're all one big team wanting
the same type of objective

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:10%
to be accomplished,
that is, disclosure

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:25.225 align:middle line:10%
in its entirety, such as
having a conversation with NHI,

00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:10%
such as having multiple
craft appear, or there's

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.300 align:middle line:10%
a big giant event that
happens where we're basically

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.220 align:middle line:10%
in a setting where
there's a lot of people

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:10%
in the government, media,
everybody that can basically

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:10%
partake in this event and we
invite non-humans to show up.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And if that does happen and
it's videotaped worldwide,

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:84%
that would be a very
defining moment for some.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.833 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
the defining moment,

00:33:46.833 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:84%
such as the president himself
coming out to a podium

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and saying, here's
photos of them.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's what we understand.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:90%
They are real.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.720 align:middle line:84%
That is disclosure
for some people.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:10%
What I personally think people
should take this approach

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.790 align:middle line:10%
is not to rely on an
external measure like that,

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:10%
but to rely on an
internal measure

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.102 align:middle line:10%
is to do the work yourself,
which everybody can.

00:34:06.102 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I don't want
you to make a prediction,

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:84%
but do you feel like Skywatcher,
and right now we are on a path

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.221 align:middle line:90%
to that reality?

00:34:12.221 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Absolutely.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
It's what we're
trying to attain.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:16.824 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to
do this for any--

00:34:16.824 --> 00:34:20.080 align:middle line:84%
we're not trying to make this
into a money-making machine

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.854 align:middle line:90%
because realistically, it can't.

00:34:21.854 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have investors, that
people are coming and donating

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.942 align:middle line:84%
and giving us what we need
in order to pull this off

00:34:26.942 --> 00:34:29.650 align:middle line:84%
because then that gives them the
assurance that they're investing

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.442 align:middle line:84%
into something that
could change the world.

00:34:31.442 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:84%
And they can be on the forefront
of us as well in achieving that.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Mike, this has been a
super fascinating discussion.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Thanks again for coming
forward with this information.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I appreciate you
having me on to tell the story.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Of course.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us.
