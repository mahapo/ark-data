>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.928 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In pop
culture, almost everyone

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:90%
refers to a Galactic Federation.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Is there a Galactic Federation?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And if so, is that how
they refer to themselves?

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So why the pop cultural
name of a Galactic Federation

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
is not being in use, other
than pop cultural terms,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I think there are a lot
of resemblances to it.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So we are talking
about a mindset being

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that is at level
six consciousness.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about a mindset being,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that means that there are
lots and lots and lots

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
of different beings,
individuals, whole star

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:84%
systems and groups
that are part of this.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So it is not like any
federation or alliance

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:90%
we have on this planet.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a loose
compendium of different species

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that dedicate
themselves to an idea.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So different species refer to
themselves as different beings.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But what we can see is
that when they communicate

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
with individuals or
groups of people on Earth,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
they sometimes refer to
themselves as "Galactic

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Federation" because
the subconsciousness

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
of the collective
memory of Earth

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
says that this is the term
that comes the closest to what

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is level
six consciousness?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we have different
levels of consciousness

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that a being inside of the
universe can go through.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a model, and you
know all models are wrong,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:90%
but some are helpful.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So we use it to
determine on which

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness
the form or an individual

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:90%
of the universe is.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So in level three consciousness,
we have conventional physics.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:90%
We have dualistic worldviews.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So the ego is going to
develop inside of a life form.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth level
of consciousness,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
we have a more loose
structure to consciousness.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Beings realize that they,
for example, can enter time.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
They also realize that
everything is connected,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that we all have individual
features, but we're all one.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So they have a different
approach, and that results

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:90%
in a different kind of reality.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when everything
is one, it's clearly

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that there are
different possibilities,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's easier to
harmonize things.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How would you
describe that being

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:90%
coming from the 4D or 5D?

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
What would that being
look like in the 3D?

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
If we went back to
the 2D, we're flat.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, this being
looks like everything we

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
see right now.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So the sixth level
of consciousness

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:84%
is kind of the realm
of non-existence.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't fit to every
being that has a level six

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, but we're talking
about a living life form that

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
yet has not a history,
which is the universe,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:90%
its kind of source.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But it has this level
six consciousness,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:90%
which is just void.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we from
this perspective

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
we are right now at,
we can experience this

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
being as everything that is.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So that is somehow the reason
why we could resemble it to--

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:90%
relate it to gods or something.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So does that
mean that we're all

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
connected through
that resonating being,

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's how telepathy
and stuff like that work?

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:90%
How are they communicating?

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: We are all this being.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.942 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We are all
the being, right.

00:04:56.942 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a mindset
being, which means

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:84%
that it's created through
the individual decisions

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
that every life form
takes; every life form

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
as a consciousness unit
has the opportunity

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:84%
to take several decisions
in the life span.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And once they realize
every life form

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that they are responsible for
the way the universe turns out,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
they automatically connect
to this kind of life form.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think we're talking
about the Galactic Federation,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
because they are very beneficial
to the whole overall universe

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and the process in which it
behaves and goes through.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This sounds
like the Vedas.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about one source.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:90%
Is there any relation to that?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It is, absolutely.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So what we can find is that
the Vedic scriptures are a way

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to describe this being or
this state of the universe

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that we all will
experience at some time.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But it depends on
the decisions that we

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
take on the path of
evolution that we take.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So everyone who commits
themselves to this kind of life

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.520 align:middle line:84%
form-- let's call it Galactic
Federation or whatever you want

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to call it--

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
you take a decision
for your life

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this
harmonious universe

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%
that we are approaching to.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the Vedas, they
mentioned these blue gods,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:90%
these blue beings.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.867 align:middle line:84%
Now is there any
correlation with this being?

00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's not only the Vedics.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have blue beings
all over the place.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You have in some areas
different images of blue beings.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do with the way
these beings communicate.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
If you have a high frequential
being that reaches down

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:84%
to a consciousness
unit that lifts inside

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
of a level three or
level four consciousness,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
it compresses the frequency
of this vibrations,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:90%
and so things appear blue.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And different people
see different things.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So while I see them as some
kind of geometrical code

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.795 align:middle line:84%
or some geometrical form,
some other people I know

00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
have seen them in human
form as blue humans,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
just as we have in the
Vedics, for example, when we

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:90%
talk about Shiva and Krishna.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did this
Federation come to be?

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So there's only one
requirement for membership,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and I have to clarify
that this is not

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:84%
a coherent, official
democratic organization.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:90%
It is a mindset being.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And that means an
individual or a collective

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
has to make themselves dedicated
to the idea of a harmonious one

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
being universe that has
several individual and diverse

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
properties, but
it is all oriented

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
towards this unification
process of the universe.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even have to
know about this Federation.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So once an individual
takes the decision

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
commit themselves

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
to this wonderful one
being harmonious context,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
they automatically will be
drawn into this mindset being.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the end result is
still in a process, which means

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:84%
we know we are on this
process, and it will 100%

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:90%
turn out great.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But the way it turns
out and it's played out

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
is still up to the individual
responsibilities of everyone.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What beings are
part of this Federation?

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So it's a
natural process.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
A mindset being means that
a natural force will combine

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
people and individuals
or even collectives

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that is
that is dedicated

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
to this idea of a
harmonious single universe.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can either, for
example, have a yogi in Tibet

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
or something that has this
life-changing spiritual

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
experience of, we are all one
and we are all great and divine

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, he either
may transform instantly

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:84%
or he may first die
or whatever that is.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple, multiple
realities and multiple options

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But he gets drawn on his path
and continuing this reality.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And it might take some time.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It might go faster if we all
commit ourselves to this,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
but it also it could also take
some time to figure this out.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, we
will have this mindset

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:90%
being come into reality.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, who rules
the Federation hierarchy?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So in natural
terms, there's

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
no real hierarchy because
they all commit to this idea

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:90%
that we are one.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
There in the process,
there are different beings

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and collectives that still
experience hierarchy.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So as humans are, as Greys
are, as different species are.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But in the end
result, we're going

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to have a one being
universe that is harmonious

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and that sees worth
in every aspect of it.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But there is some
natural force that

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
brings the collective
or individuals together.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if an
individual is not as far

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:84%
evolved to create its own
destiny and its own path,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's very dedicated to the
idea of a harmonious world,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:84%
then the structure
of the universe

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:84%
is so that when the
soul, the consciousness

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
leaves the earthly body, for
example, it gets reincarnated

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.383 align:middle line:84%
into some different aspect
and level of consciousness,

00:11:32.383 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's
going to happen.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Some other beings
and collectives

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
are very engaged into this
process of bringing people

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
into this state, and we're
experiencing that right now.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is their
involvement with Earth?

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So naturally the
members of this Federation,

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
then they tend to
be non-invasive.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So an individual or a collective
must decide for themselves

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and in their own process
to dedicate themselves

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:90%
to this kind of universe.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Once we do this-- and this
is the reason why I gave out

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
the sentence, Earth
shift happily now--

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that is mostly enough
to become part of this.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Others, they might want
to have the experience

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and might take some more
time and might find pleasure

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
in a dualistic universe,
and that is OK too.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
We will come to an
episode where we

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
natural law and the law

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that, for example, the
Greys are advocating,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
which will speed up
the process a lot.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
there are some forces

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
extraterrestrial forces, that

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:90%
try to ascend humanity faster.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Because, to be
honest, people haven't

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:90%
been prepared for way too long.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So explain the methods.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So as I said,
the methods are

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
pretty non-invasive
because these beings

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:27.185 align:middle line:84%
think that it's not right to
influence or to push a species.

00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there's no
right or wrong, right?

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.435 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: There's no
right or wrong,

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and there are members
within this Federation

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that are invasive, and
they are pushing it.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And we will come to that, and
the Greys and humanity they

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:90%
are all part of this.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But some of the methods
have been more subtle.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
when the human race

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:90%
was experiencing World War II.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
You had the definition of a
dualistic centered worldview,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
where parties are opponing
against each other.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly within
this realm, one doctor

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:10%
found this component
of LSD quite late

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:10%
because he was using
and experimenting

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:10%
on that some time before, but
it still was in that time frame.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So unluckily enough, LSD
used to be the number one

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
catalyst for the
hippie movement,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
for the movement of love and
united consciousness and stuff,

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:90%
so it's super important.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And if everything could have
rolled out according to plan,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:84%
then the experience of World War
II wouldn't have been possible.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who represents
humanity or planet Earth

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
with this Federation?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It is a
homogeneous collective,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
which means that either
individuals or collectives can

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.120 align:middle line:90%
be part of this.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:84%
You can have unfortunately
or diversely,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
we have some structures that
are authoritarian on Earth.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So there were beings,
for example, the Greys,

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that have showed the
consequences of continuing

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
this deception that's
going on Earth.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And through that, lots
of people in charge

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:84%
realized that it's necessary
to change something.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Because Earth still
is a collective memory

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be shifted.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And unlikely as other
members of this collective,

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
of this Galactic
Federation, there

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
are authoritarian processes
within the ascension of Earth,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is why it took
so long for some species

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:90%
to have this ascension.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who from Earth is
benefiting from this alliance,

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
since most of
humanity doesn't even

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:90%
acknowledge extraterrestrials?

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well in the
end, everyone benefits.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe
benefits from it.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
in the universe

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
needs to go through this
evolutionary complex

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and process to come to this
point that we are all connected

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and to be harmoniously
living together

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
while individually keeping
up your preferences in life.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
While there are
extraterrestrial forces that

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
interact with this planet, and
they have a very, very strong

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
will to ascend humanity
as fast as possible,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't necessarily need
to acknowledge the presence

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:90%
of non-terrestrial beings.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So in another
timeline, one might

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.540 align:middle line:84%
find that the
universe is connected

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
and the universe is harmonious
and loving in its structure,

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:84%
and that is enough to
make this being six come

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:90%
into place in another timeline.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
What we are dealing
with right here

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
is a more challenging
timeline in a way

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that there are systems
and species that

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
still want to remain the
dualistic world worldview.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
That means that we
have to integrate that

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:90%
into the overall process.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
That also means that systems
that are already established

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth cannot
easily be removed.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
They need to be
transformed, and that's

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:90%
what's happening right now.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could that shift
actually cause a war?

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The dimension of
possible ways where it could go

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:90%
are almost infinite.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The worst thing
that could happen

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
is a collective psychosis,
which means that people that

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
are unaware of the shift
because they are still

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
caught into this
kind of installation

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and this process and thinking
of level three consciousness,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
they will have a
hard time to realize

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
what's happening when
Earth is shifting

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:90%
to level four consciousness.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Which means a lot of, for them
strange things will happen.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:84%
For example,
non-terrestrial beings.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:10%
And that and because, tick
tock, the time's running,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:10%
and that's the reason
why we have this Pentagon

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:10%
report preparing people that
they soon will be together

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.080 align:middle line:10%
with other beings.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You said that there
was pressure and time that we

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:90%
have to get our stuff together.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So when is that time,
in your opinion?

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It is now.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Time is always now,
but the process is now

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:84%
right in front of
everyone's eyes,

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and everyone gets prepared
in a different way.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And globally as well that,
because there are also

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:84%
structures on Earth
that are established,

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and those people that benefit
from these structures,

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
they see and know the necessity
of preparing people for change.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But they still want to be on
the sunny side of everything

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:90%
to keep the narrative.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that's very human-like

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to the more things
seem to change,

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:90%
the more they grab into that.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Which is basically
a lack of trust,

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and trust is something that
is needs, A, experience,

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:90%
and B, positive affirmation.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So there are structures
that right now

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
want to keep the narrative
as close as possible.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But there are also forces,
for example, the Greys,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that want to have the change
and need to have the change.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
these structures

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:90%
when this transition happens.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate on
what is the structure?

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, so Earth
is a planet that

00:20:52.160 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
has several properties
that are a little bit

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
different to other
structures in the universe.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have to deal
with a warrior type structure

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, which means that the
genetic encoding of a human

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:84%
being allows certain groups
on this planet to evolve

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:90%
into a warrior type species.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And that can go into a good
direction, which is something

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys
want to elaborate,

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
but it also could tend to
go into a direction that

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
is self-destructive
to the universe.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And the natural law--

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:90%
as you said, no good, no bad--

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
it means that
everyone has the right

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to experience what they
need to experience.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So this overall process
that is going on right now

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:90%
is very, very sensitive matter.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What technology might
they be sharing with Earth?

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So there are forces
in the universe that

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:90%
keep an eye on this process.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:84%
This is why things are very
well-structured but they still

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:90%
keep--

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
the free will of every
individual is still kept.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Which means the process
and the decisions

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:84%
are forced upon everyone, but
everyone can still decide.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is, for
example, something

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys have
an observing eye on.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking
about technology,

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
the normal proceedings of
this kind of natural evolution

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, which affects
multiple dimensions, millions

00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
of life forms, it's normally
not so much into technology.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural process.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's a natural
process that everyone

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:84%
needs to go through when
experiencing their lives

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and developing some kind
of spiritual connection

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:90%
to the whole universe.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But on Earth, we have
a different situation

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:84%
because there has
been some deception,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and there has been a model
and installation that

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.400 align:middle line:84%
makes it really
hard for everyone

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
to have time to meditate,
to come to the realization.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Still, we have this force that
will lead Earth into a higher

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:84%
frequency, into a part
of the universe where

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Earth will experience higher
energy waves surrounding it.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
reason why we have,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
tick tock, this
time thing going on

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
rushed a little bit.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are we seeing the
influence of this Federation

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.530 align:middle line:90%
on Earth today?

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So one thing
that is going to happen

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
is when Earth enters a
full harmonious level four

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, things
will turn out differently.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
We already have
different physics

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.630 align:middle line:84%
than the Earth had in
level three consciousness,

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
but we also have
different life forms.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the Pentagon
reports acknowledges that.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So they are
phenomenons going on.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And while the Earth is
protected right now,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:84%
those things will appear, and
they will affect everyone.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason why we
have this process right now.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
important to preserve

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
this being six or this
Galactic Federation

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
because this is the way
the universe will turn out

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and will be a mutual
benefit for everyone.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Still on the way, we are
having some things that

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
need to be figured out,
but Earth is getting help,

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.063 align:middle line:90%
and that's good.

00:25:20.063 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That is good.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And everyone
can participate

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in that when they speak
their wishes into existence.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that everyone
was suggesting in the comments

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:90%
was, all shift happily now.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Tim,
it's always a pleasure

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
to have you on the show.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you
very much, Emery.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.263 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: Next, on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:25:47.263 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did
your relationship

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.020 align:middle line:84%
with the Greys actually
develop, and when?

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: There were direct
meetings, which I assume

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:90%
were set up by the Greys.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.960 align:middle line:84%
They have this kind of
metallic sound that they use.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:84%
They have these tablets, the
hieroglyphs, and the signs

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:84%
that they use in
written language.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And on the other half, you
have the German translation.
