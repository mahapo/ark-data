00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:10%
we are talking about
the metaphysics of multi

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.500 align:middle line:10%
and interdimensional
beings with Randy Cramer,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:10%
a veteran of the secret space
program known as the Earth

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
Defense Forces.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY CRAMER: Thank
you for having me, Emery.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.407 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, so we're
all on the same page.

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
How do we actually
define the multi

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and the interdimensionals?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Ooh, it's
a little complicated.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:84%
When we think about dimensions
as far as frequencies,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think of 1D, 2D,
3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, et cetera.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So those are the harmonics,
what we call the harmonics.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And as far as we understand,
that goes from one to 12.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Then you have overtones.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And the overtones within each
harmonic, there are also 12.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And the overtones are
stages of consciousness

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:90%
within that harmonic.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, in the 3D
harmonic where we are right

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:90%
now, there are 12 overtones.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
The first three overtones
are mineral consciousness.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
The second three overtones
are vegetable consciousness.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
The third set of three overtones
are lower higher animals.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And the last three
overtones are higher

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
higher animals, which we tend
to fall in that category.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:90%
So we tend to be--

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:84%
human beings tend to be at
either overtone 10, 11, or 12.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
to overtone 12 is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.742 align:middle line:84%
when you can start to
be at either 3-12 or 4-1

00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and where you start to
be able to sort of exist

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
in both frequencies
at the same time.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So are we coexisting
in multiple dimensions at one

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:90%
time?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, that would
describe the elevations

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:90%
of frequency.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Then you're talking about
the potential for parallels.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And the parallels
are where you start

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to get interdimensional
beings and interdimensional

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
places where are in between
the layers of harmonics.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:90%
So you could have a harmonic--

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
a line of harmonics and
another line of harmonics that,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:84%
again, normally
would match here,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and then you can have
a space in between that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
where something else
can create a space

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
or choose to exist
in a frequency that's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:90%
specific to them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, how does the
mind and body actually move up

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and down and back and
forth, side to side,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
through these
dimensional frequencies?

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, as
near as we understand,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
it's something that's
regulated by the pineal gland

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and regulated by
neurotransmitter production.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the production
of dimethyltryptophan

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
within the pineal gland is what
seems to chemically regulate

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
the physical biological
experience of being in one

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:90%
dimensional state or another.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that
the flexibility

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to move from one
frequency to another

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
or move from one
dimension to another

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:84%
is regulated by the pineal
gland in neurotransmitters.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are those
neurotransmitters connecting

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to the brain to give you
a picture and understand

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:90%
frequencies of harmonics?

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it building some sort
of non-visual picture

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:90%
in your brain?

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think more
accurately what's happening is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that the endogenous production
of dimethyltryptophan

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
in the pineal gland causes the
awareness of the self to shift

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:90%
to other frequencies.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that you're
having an awareness of them.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
You're having an actual
experience of them.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So people who have worked
with endogenous and exogenous

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.765 align:middle line:84%
dimethyltryptophan find that if
I were to have this experience,

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I would still be
sitting in this chair.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%
You would not see my body move.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:90%
It would still be here.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But my perception of where
I am and what's around me

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:90%
would completely change.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So that seems to be a
awareness shift that

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:90%
happens up here, not out here.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is that something
that I'm familiar with,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:90%
such as bilocating?

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Or is that different?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: That's different.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Bilocating is actually
moving my body

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:90%
from one location to another.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever seen
any of these interdimensional,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
multidimensional beings?

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, for sure.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.172 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what
do they look like?

00:04:50.172 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:90%
How would they appear to us?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They seem
to appear, again,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
in ways that our
brains can accept.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So we hear stories
about them appearing

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
as like a giant honeybee
or a giant bumblebee

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
or a giant fish or a being
with blue skin or pink

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:90%
skin or green skin.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You have these
variations that the mind

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:90%
seems to be able to accept.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So the perception
of the beings is

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
directly related to the
ability of the individual

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to perceive them.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you and I, for
instance, were sitting here

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and had a experience with
the vibrational change

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
in the pineal gland
and we both went

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
into a similar
interdimensional space,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:90%
you might perceive it one way.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Your brain might
decode it one way.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.193 align:middle line:84%
My brain might decode
it another way.

00:05:42.193 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we come back
into this experience

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and write down what
happened and compare notes,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
we might be able to decode
what's actually happening there

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:90%
and what's perception.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: A lot of times I
talk to my students and I say,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
you might see a light in the
sky or right in front of you,

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
especially when we do our close
encounters of the fifth kind

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:90%
making contact.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But that light doesn't always
represent what it really is.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Right.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: For instance, if I
was in the 2D right now or I was

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in my 2D form, I would
be flat, let's say.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And in a 3D, of course, I
have this three dimensional

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.957 align:middle line:90%
sub-state, subspace body.

00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But in the fourth dimension,
now what would I look like?

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Or the fifth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think looking at
these models, we'll say,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional
multidimensional beings

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that it's not always
exactly what you perceive,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:90%
like you just said.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.578 align:middle line:84%
I could perceive it
differently than you,

00:06:39.578 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
even though we're
looking at the same thing

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:90%
or experiencing the same thing.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely correct.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, we get a lot
of people sending in pictures

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
of orbs and lights and things,
of course, shooting around.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Are people mistaking these
interdimensional beings

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
as UFOs?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.373 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: That can
happen sometimes.

00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Certainly people
don't always know

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
what they're looking at
when they see something.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.143 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes a person will
see something and presume

00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that they know what that
is or think that they

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:90%
can interpret what it is.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But they may not be correct if
they're not a trained observer.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So someone may be
claiming to have seen an angel

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:90%
that visited them.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was
their interpretation

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of a multidimensional
interdimensional being.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Very likely, yes.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And also
out under the stars,

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of people seeing
lights and figures that are

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:90%
going by.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But they can't make
it out completely.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And we would have a
group of people there,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.290 align:middle line:84%
30, 40, 50 people sometimes, and
maybe this half of the circle

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:90%
will see something.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
This half will have a completely
different visual perspective

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Is that because of our line of
sight or our line of frequency,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
should I say?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think it has
more to do with our line

00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:90%
of frequency.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I have certainly
talked to people

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
who have been standing
with a group of people,

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
looked up in the sky, and
seen something and said, hey,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
can you see that?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And not everybody can see it.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Some people can
some people can't.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's an indication
that these things

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:90%
are frequency specific.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you are vibrating
frequency specific,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:90%
then you can see them.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.173 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not,
then you won't.

00:08:22.173 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what are some of
the ones that you have seen?

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
What did they look like?

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: It's interesting.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I see
them interpretively.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
And there are other times
when I see them as code,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
as geometric mathematical code.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.929 align:middle line:90%
And that's interesting.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
That feels like that's
the more pure form

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:90%
of what that reality is.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And that then the brain has to
turn that into something that's

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:84%
more aesthetically
pleasing or that

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
makes us feel more
comfortable than just

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
staring at geometric
code at everything.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes they
appear like human beings

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
like you or I. Or sometimes
they might appear, again,

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
like animals or
extraterrestrials.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It really just depends
on probably where

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm at my own head
space in my life

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and who or what the
consciousness that's

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:90%
communicating with me is.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Where do plasma-like
and shadow-like beings fit

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.372 align:middle line:90%
into all this?

00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Ooh, that's
an interesting question.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, we certainly know that
one of the fundamental quantum

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
components of reality are
these states of frequency

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of quantum particles.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And the highest
frequency particle

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
we call sacred light and the
lowest frequency particle

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:90%
we call corrupted light.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And so that's more
than likely beings

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
who are very high
vibration in sacred light

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:84%
or very high vibration
in corrupted light.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So something that is
filled with a lot of light

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
will appear that way,
will emanate more light,

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.523 align:middle line:84%
where something that has
got that corrupted light

00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
will look more
shadowy, more dark.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it tends to make
things look good or look evil,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:90%
because they kind of are.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are threat to us on
this 3D plane when we see that?

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Not usually.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Their ability to
influence and affect us

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with what
we believe their ability

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:90%
to affect us is.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So if we believe they
have an effect on us,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.273 align:middle line:90%
then they can affect us.

00:10:27.273 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:84%
If we believe they don't
have an effect on us,

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.253 align:middle line:90%
then they tend to not.

00:10:30.253 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So it's our thinking
and our belief systems that

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
actually become our own
reality when we're visualizing.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: More than
anything else, yes.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So is there any way
to access these levels that

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
the beings are on and even
communicate with them?

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh yeah, sure.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Self mastery of the
mind is definitely

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
a way in which you can tune the
frequency of your consciousness

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and communicate with
all kinds of beings.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how
would you do that?

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I teach my students
that in a long course that

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
would be way more hours than
what we have to discuss here.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But it is a combination
of understanding

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
brainwave mastery, meditative
techniques, and what

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I would call the operating
system of tools in which one

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
changes their frequency
and their perception.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's breathing techniques,
visualization techniques,

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
setting the frequency
of your brainwaves

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to get into alpha theta
states, and developing that.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So being able to do that one
time is not self mastery.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:90%
It's like baby steps.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I started the journey.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:84%
When you've done that
for the hundredth time,

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.203 align:middle line:84%
then you're approaching
some form of self

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
mastery, because you're actually
getting better and better

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:90%
and better at the skill.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, is there any
benefits interacting with these

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Awareness.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.877 align:middle line:90%
Information.

00:11:55.877 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
These beings have a
lot of information

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.877 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of access
to information

00:11:58.877 --> 00:11:59.993 align:middle line:90%
that they want to share.

00:11:59.993 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're encouraging
us to understand

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:84%
how to access that
information as well.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, knowledge,
information, truth.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Little things like that.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We've had a lot
of scientists that worked

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in the projects with me that
would come and tell me that

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
they had seen something in the
lab or they had felt something.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And they've been working on
something diligently for weeks

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
at a time but didn't
have the answer.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Then after this experience,
they had the answer.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, all it really
takes to get that sort of aha

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
moment is actually something
we call a awakened mind state.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So a brainwave pattern
that is symmetrical and has

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
the right amplitudes of
beta, alpha, theta, and delta

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
create these ideal or
awakened mind patterns.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that when
we have these aha moments,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
it's the conscious and the
subconscious connecting.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And probably more
than anything else,

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:84%
those beings are facilitating
that brainwave state

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have
our own awareness.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to
go, here's an idea.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.593 align:middle line:90%
Let me give that to you.

00:13:07.593 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Really they can
just go, well, let

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
me stimulate your brainwaves so
you create that ideal brainwave

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
state and then you have
your own aha moment

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
as you draw up that information
from your subconscious.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.160 align:middle line:84%
As I tell my students,
if you're conscious brain

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:84%
part of your mind
has an IQ of 120,

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious
brain has an IQ

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
of several hundred
points higher than that.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So connecting with your
conscious and subconscious

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
brain is what gives us
access to super thinking

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and super information
and gives us access

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:90%
to what I call the super brain.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I usually
don't personify inter

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and multidimensional beings,
because I consider them higher

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
than myself and higher than most
things around the planet here.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But are they looking out
for us, for humanity?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think there is
still a shadow part of that?

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think our
experience tells us that most

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:90%
of them are beneficial.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are here to help.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:90%
But that's not exclusive.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:84%
There are always troublemakers
everywhere you go.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'd call that
probably fitting into the 95/5

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
breakdown, where you
have 95% that's basically

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to help and cooperate
and that 5% that just

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:90%
is trying to cause trouble.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you had any
experience with synthetic

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional
multidimensional beings where

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
we had made them and
sent them on missions?

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is a little
negative, but I

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.332 align:middle line:84%
want to go there, because you
could probably answer this.

00:14:36.332 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The so-called shadow
agents that are sent to spy

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:90%
on you to maybe cause harm.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So there is an awareness
of how this works.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.133 align:middle line:84%
And certain people
in certain programs

00:14:53.133 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
are certainly using these
tools and these techniques

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to create more nefarious agents
to perform more nefarious acts.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:90%
So it does happen.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not the majority of
activity, but it does happen.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they taking a
human from the 3D and maybe

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
taking this frequency out of
them and making this being?

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Or are they actually
making the being?

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They're usually
taking to start a human being

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and then changing
them from there.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of this
involves cybernetics.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of this involves
genetic engineering.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And it involves retooling the
brain and the conscious energy

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
self to serve a purpose.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And what you have
to do to a person

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:84%
to damage what they are to
turn them into something else

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:90%
is pretty horrific.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And we at United States
Marine Corps Special Section

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.422 align:middle line:84%
think that this kind of
behavior needs to stop.

00:15:54.422 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons why we
want sunshine and disclosure

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and everything so
that we can start

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:84%
highlighting some of the things
that we need to put an end to.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And that would be one of them.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Because people don't come
back from this process.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.738 align:middle line:84%
Once you've been transformed
into something like that,

00:16:08.738 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
there's no coming back from it.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.305 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
die, and your consciousness

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
will have to be
released from your body

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:84%
before you have a chance
to remake yourself.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they have any
conflict with extraterrestrials

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.215 align:middle line:84%
or are they the
extraterrestrials?

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: No, I would say
sometimes they're having

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:84%
conflict with the
extraterrestrials, yeah.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
extraterrestrials that

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:90%
may engage in that behavior.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are we considered
extraterrestrials

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:90%
in their eyes?

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.977 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, that
is an interesting point.

00:16:37.977 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:84%
If you and I go to another
planet, we're the alien.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we're as
much extraterrestrials

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.065 align:middle line:90%
as anybody else is.

00:16:44.065 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, have you
personally learned anything

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
from these different
dimensional beings?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh yeah.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of
metaphysics has greatly

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
been expanded because of that
information and that teaching,

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are interdimensional
and multidimensional beings

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:90%
coexisting?

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
Are they here right now?

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I would say there's
about a 100% chance that there

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is something else in this
room that we can't see that is

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
a multi or
interdimensional being.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.817 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:17:14.817 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: And I would say
that most of the time there are

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
things happening around
us that we don't see,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that the air is full of things,
sentient beings as well as what

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I would think of as
natural animal life.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.733 align:middle line:84%
Wildlife that exists within
those dimensional frequencies.

00:17:35.733 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, I know we have
to be at a certain frequency

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:84%
to see them and to
interact with them.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But on their side, is it--
do they see multi dimensions?

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Do they see
interdimensionally constantly?

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.468 align:middle line:84%
Or do they just kind of
change their frequency

00:17:51.468 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to
listen to you and I, Randy?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.732 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: It's usually a
matter of dialing frequency.

00:17:57.732 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
There are beings who
certainly have the ability

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:84%
to perceive across timelines,
across dimensional frequencies

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But most beings make a choice
from any moment to moment

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
on what they want to
focus on and where

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:90%
their perception wants to be.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So someone could be
in this room right

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%
here and not see us and
not interact with us,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:84%
because they're fully in
the dimensional frequency

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
that they're in.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Or they could be
riding the edge,

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
as we say, and
they could be here,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:84%
seeing us, listening
to us, whether curious

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
or wanting to help the
process along or hinder

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
the process could also
be an option there.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
But there tends to
be something outside

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
of the visible light
spectrum around us

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:90%
at just about all times.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are we a
multidimensional being,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and can we actually through our
subconscious communicate with

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.323 align:middle line:90%
them by not even knowing it?

00:18:55.323 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.948 align:middle line:84%
We are definitely
multidimensional beings

00:18:57.948 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that exist in multiple
dimensions at the same time.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are things
happening in, again,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
in that dial of
perception that's

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
outside what we're perceiving
at the moment that's

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:90%
still happening.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And that can include
information downloads,

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
someone whispering into your
ear that manifests itself

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
as a subconscious thought
or a subconscious idea

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
that you think you had on your
own, not necessarily you did.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.225 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the difference
between dimensions and density

00:19:26.225 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:90%
that you keep mentioning?

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: When we
talk about harmonics,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.790 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think of
those as the densities,

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
because as you go
from lower to higher,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you become less dense matter
and more energy, more light.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So the higher and higher
you go in these densities,

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:84%
you're more light
in less matter.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
We're at the place where
we're more matter than energy

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we go into 4D, we'll
be about 50-50 matter and energy

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.570 align:middle line:90%
that's more malleable.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And then 5D is really
not even needing

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
a physical biological
shell at all.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
You can exist as pure
energy at that point, which

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
can be a matter of manifesting
what you want to look like,

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:90%
visualizing your virtual self.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are these some of the
pop culture terms like shape

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
shifters and werewolves
and vampires?

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.953 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They can fall
into those categories, yes.

00:20:24.953 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about
poltergeists and spirits?

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.763 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:20:27.763 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: That's
a good question.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You certainly-- if there
is a phenomena which

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
you can measure, meaning
something physical

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:84%
happens that you can say,
oh, that actually happened.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I have talked to people who
certainly have gone back

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to look at surveillance
camera footage

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and seen an object on
a shelf get pushed off.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fall.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
to knock it over,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
but you can see a force hitting
it and knocking it over.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Or doors opening or slamming
windows, opening or slamming.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
These are evidence that
something is actually

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.290 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So when you know that
something's actually happening,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the question of what
it is is a matter

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of understanding,
identification, and definition,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:84%
which if we can't fully
perceive what it is, well,

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to make
an assessment of what

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:90%
that thing is.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So just for instance,
if someone was

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
experiencing poltergeist
activity in their home,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:90%
is it an echo?

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it a poltergeist?

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it a multidimensional,
interdimensional,

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial being
or some other option?

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, that comes
down to investigation

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.333 align:middle line:84%
and identification
of through someone

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
who's a trained observer,
knows what questions

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to ask, know what
data to gather,

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
know what instruments to
use that from that data pool

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
can then make an analysis
and a conclusion.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:84%
But off the top automatically,
just because something happens,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:55.610 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
We can't say, was
that a poltergeist

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:90%
or a ghost or an alien?

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Without further analysis and
examination, you don't know.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, a lot of these
amateur scientists use trifield

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:84%
meters and electromagnetic field
meters and they record these

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:90%
things when they're there.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We even use them out in
the field for our CE5s

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and we might just see a
little flash of light,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden the
meter goes crazy for a while.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Is that some sort
of portal opening?

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, I
would say that, again,

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.823 align:middle line:84%
these are tools that
are indicating that

00:22:29.823 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:90%
something's happening.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:84%
They're registering that a
physical change in the laws

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:90%
of physics are happening.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And again, without better
tools, better analysis

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.843 align:middle line:84%
to bring to better
conclusions, again,

00:22:43.843 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that's just telling us that
there's something there.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.385 align:middle line:84%
It's not telling
us what's there.

00:22:47.385 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just telling us
that something is there.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's definitely indicating
that it's not nothing.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There was some,
ah, it's nothing.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:90%
It's your imagination.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
No, we've got some
instrumentation

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.393 align:middle line:84%
that's showing us
that it's something,

00:22:58.393 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:90%
that it's not my imagination.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But that instrumentation
at this point

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
isn't sophisticated enough to
tell you exactly what you're

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:90%
dealing with.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.693 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: There are thousands
of people going missing in these

00:23:08.693 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:84%
national parks every year
and all around the planet.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Is there any relation
about interdimensional

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional beings having
anything to do with this

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:84%
or do you have an explanation
about why this happens?

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
I have two explanations.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So we certainly have a situation
where corporate programs need

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:90%
bodies for experimentation.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:90%
They need bodies to fill jobs.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:90%
They need bodies as boots.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So they're constantly
abducting and stealing people.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So again, without more data on
an individual disappearance,

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:84%
it's not so straightforward
to say whether it's A or B.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But we can kind of say
it probably is A or B.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So option A is someone's
being abducted,

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:90%
probably by a corporate system.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of that might be
military, but the military

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:84%
is under very strict
guidelines right now

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
about abducting
civilian personnel.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not something that
we can do with impunity like we

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:90%
used to do 20 or 30 years ago.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably less and less
the military's involvement

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and more and more corporate
programs that just don't care.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
They have no moral,
ethical center.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:90%
They have a profit motive.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And whatever gets them
to where they need to be

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:90%
is what they'll do.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's one option.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Turns out there's
another option as well.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.437 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of facilities
in these mountain ranges,

00:24:33.437 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the Cascade
Range and the Rocky Mountain

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
range, where there
are spaceports.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
There are these children
of the Atlanteans

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:84%
who moved around and settled in
some of these places like Mount

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.375 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, for instance, to name
one that everybody knows.

00:24:49.375 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: So a lot of these
beings in these different

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
facilities have been
experiencing more and more

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
people going into the mountains
and exploring, hiking,

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and camping.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
making them nervous.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like people getting too
close to their front lawn.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So they've started putting
up these shieldings which

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:90%
are a time space shield.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for a time space
shield and not a force shield,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
if I come up against a
force field, I hit it.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:90%
I know it's there.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.495 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't want
someone to hit something

00:25:21.495 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that they can recognize
as there and go, hey,

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:90%
what's happening here?

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And start doing you know
mime trapped in a box.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.135 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
physical phenomena

00:25:30.135 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make people go,
wait, what's going on here?

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that to happen.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So by using this
time space field,

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I could be walking into it, turn
around and walk the other way,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and still think that
I'm walking forward.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.977 align:middle line:84%
So it has the ability of
turning someone around

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
without them realizing that
they're being turned around.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So instead of running up against
something that I can feel,

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.340 align:middle line:84%
it just turns me around
without me even noticing

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:90%
that I'm turned around.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll be like, wait,
I thought I was going east,

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:84%
not west, and then I'd
be confused and go,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
oh, I got turned
around and think

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.463 align:middle line:84%
that it's all my
fault when I was

00:26:02.463 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:90%
hitting one of these fields.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is these
fields are not totally stable.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:90%
They have little holes in them.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen to walk
through a hole, you're screwed.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.578 align:middle line:84%
You're basically trapped
on the other side

00:26:16.578 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
where you're probably going to
starve to death because you're

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.740 align:middle line:84%
not going to be able
to get back out.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes these
beings in these facilities,

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
they find these
people and they go,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:84%
oh, another one got
trapped in the field.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And they'll pluck them out and
put their clothes back on them

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:84%
if they need to and then send
them out somewhere but not

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.530 align:middle line:90%
necessarily where they came in.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
They might pop out 20, 100 miles
away, not know what's going on,

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:84%
have two, three, four,
five, days go by.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, they may
perceive many more days or even

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
weeks going by and find
themselves 100 miles away

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:90%
four days later.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So it tends to be
an either an A or B.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So either there's corporate
abduction probably

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:84%
thing happening
or they're running

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%
into one of these time space
fields and going through a hole

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:90%
and then being lost.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's such that you and I
could literally walking down

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
a path with inches
between our elbows

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and I could be looking off to
the right and then turn back

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:90%
and you'd be gone.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.522 align:middle line:84%
You'd be like, Emery,
where'd you go?

00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And you could walk
through a pocket

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.987 align:middle line:84%
and turn around and go,
Randy, where'd you go?

00:27:22.987 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Or even worse, you might
go through a pocket,

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:84%
still see me, and then
go, hey, hey, hey,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and then I wouldn't
see you or hear you,

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and then you'd be confused at
why I can't see or hear you.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But then you would realize that
you couldn't reach out and grab

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:84%
me on the shoulder
and that you're

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
trapped on the other
side of this field.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:90%
So it would suck.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:48.792 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it can happen that
way and be so immediate and so

00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:51.250 align:middle line:84%
right that very second that
someone could be standing right

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
next to you and you could
turn away and then turn

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.433 align:middle line:90%
and they'd be gone.

00:27:55.433 --> 00:27:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Has this
ever happened to you?

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.298 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Not to me, no.

00:27:58.298 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
It has not happened
to me personally.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how did you know
about this technology and how

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.932 align:middle line:84%
did you know about the
people going missing?

00:28:04.932 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I started hearing
some people talking about some

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:90%
of these people going missing.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And I asked our
intel staff if they

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.232 align:middle line:84%
had any information on that, and
that was the report they had.

00:28:15.232 --> 00:28:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you believe
there's any cooperation with

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
interdimensional beings that

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
are here to assist us
and help us evolve?

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I would think there's plenty
of eyewitness testimony

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:90%
to suggest that that's true.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I certainly get emails
from people all the time

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
talking about their
personal experiences

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and talking about beings that
they've seen in some cases

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:84%
since they were children and
what information they provide.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, these
beings have done things

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to intercede and
save people's lives.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I know someone who was driving
down a country road in a car

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and heard a voice that said,
you need to pull over right now.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And she pulled over, and
within a couple of seconds,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.050 align:middle line:84%
a log truck came flying
down the other direction

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.145 align:middle line:90%
crossing lanes out of control.

00:29:05.145 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And if she had not
pulled off the side,

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:84%
she would have been front
end plowed by a log truck.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So there are definitely beings
that are trying to help.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Teaching people,
helping them advance

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
their own understanding
of metaphysics,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.470 align:middle line:90%
their own meditative process.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
literally saying,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:84%
look out and
getting people to do

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.067 align:middle line:90%
things that save their lives.

00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, if they see
us doing something bad,

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:84%
maybe blowing off
a nuclear bomb,

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:84%
would they actually come and try
to help with that and say, hey,

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.605 align:middle line:90%
you guys.

00:29:35.605 --> 00:29:36.980 align:middle line:84%
How would they
deliver a message?

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.938 align:middle line:90%
Or would they interact?

00:29:37.938 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Because isn't it not--

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:84%
is it our world that
we're sharing with them

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.770 align:middle line:90%
or we're sharing their world?

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think they would
want us to understand that we

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.980 align:middle line:84%
all live in the same world
and that it is our perception

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of that reality that
needs to change.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't think that
we share that world with them.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't think that we're
all living in that world

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.470 align:middle line:90%
when we are.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think if
anything, they would

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:84%
like our awareness and our
expansion of our consciousness

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to get to a place where we
simply accept that the world is

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:84%
bigger than we think it is
and we share it, again, side

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.870 align:middle line:84%
by side, feet apart with other
intelligent living beings

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:20.155 align:middle line:90%
that aren't leaving.

00:30:20.155 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have the right
to say get out of here.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.730 align:middle line:84%
We just have to share space
with all kinds of living things.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When people are being
spiritual and doing meditation

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and having these out
of body experiences,

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is that us becoming maybe
more multidimensional?

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: There are certainly
experiences that people have

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that are developmental
progressive experiences.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They're also the ability for
people to experience things

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.470 align:middle line:84%
that are nothing other
than the mind or the brain

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.140 align:middle line:84%
manufacturing things
out of the subconscious.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's no universal
just because someone

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
says they've experienced
this that it's

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:90%
100% true all the time.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Nor is there a
universal every person

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
who makes this claim is
never correct, is never

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:84%
telling the truth, because
that doesn't happen.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
complicated than that.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.290 align:middle line:84%
You can have a person
who is perceiving

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:84%
something that is absolutely
accurate, is absolutely

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.562 align:middle line:84%
You can also have
someone who is perceiving

00:31:17.562 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:84%
something that is absolutely
and totally delusional.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to
figure out exactly what that

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is if you're not
a trained observer

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're not familiar
with the behaviors.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In the statement,
"as you think, as you become,"

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.822 align:middle line:84%
is that an
interpretation of this?

00:31:35.822 --> 00:31:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, I think one
of the things we understand is

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the fundamentals that we have
the ability to shift matter

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and energy with our brains,
with our thinking process.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that
through our thinking process,

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
we're able to change
the wiring of our brain,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:84%
change our genetic codes,
change our own DNA.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So truly what we think
is what we become.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And so how we choose to perceive
our thoughts, our attitudes,

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.813 align:middle line:84%
what's around us absolutely
dictates what we become.

00:32:08.813 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
