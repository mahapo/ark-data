[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.292 align:middle line:84%
>> ANNOUNCER: Previously
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD DOTY: These
entities can take on different

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:90%
appearances of us.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It's true that
consciousness can move

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:84%
into, and they totally
appear as a human form.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:90%
What's their agenda?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Are they a threat or not?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: One of the things that
the United States government

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:84%
was very, very concerned about
was whether an ET could take

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:84%
over a body, such as a
politician's body and spread

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.585 align:middle line:84%
out within the government
and take over everything.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And I would be
interested to hear

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
what Tim would have to say about
how a ET race could manipulate

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:90%
human DNA.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So especially what
I would refer to as Greys,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
they are really good at
manipulating genetics.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Also, the praying mantis,
they both work together.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:10%
Praying mantis seem to
have a more scientific way,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:10%
whereas the Greys
are really strong,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.850 align:middle line:10%
intellectual-- have a
strong intellectual approach

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:10%
to everything and a
technology approach.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And they did that
because they were able

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and are still able to move
between temporal dynamics,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
which means they can time
travel in some way or another.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
They manipulated
human DNA pretty

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of everything.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about at
least 15,000 years ago,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:90%
at least this is what they say.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And they perfected that through
the abduction phenomenon

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
at times, which doesn't mean
that they forced genetics

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:84%
upon someone who isn't
willing to do so.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
approach to that,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and we already
talked about that.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And I found that really
interesting because they

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
do preserve the free will but
still find some kind of way

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
around it because they say
that whenever someone--

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and we know the soul is
kind of a collective memory

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
system where every experience in
every incarnation is collected.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
They say if someone is
dedicated to the Grey system

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:84%
at one point of its very
long and diverse evolution,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
then they take that as
basically the free will.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And then often, people that got
abducted or have been contacted

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
or something, they
came to the situation,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and they needed to
reflect on that,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and because it's mostly
trauma-based, people

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that have those
experiences, they

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:90%
go through a lot of trauma.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And totally, it
changed their lives,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
reflect on that.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And at some point or another,
they might say, oh, well, OK.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:90%
They didn't hurt me.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:90%
They brought me back.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing bad happened.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's OK.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
Greys said, you got it.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the free will that
we needed to pick you up

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: I would
like to add to your--

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Rick.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
In the projects,
there's points where

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:90%
we were working on bodies.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
But our frequency, if we went
near the body would destroy it.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So we would be inoculated
with their frequency DNA.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
That would only last
four to eight hours,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
so we could get near the
body to take the samples.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I think that's what
Hal was working on, yeah.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.027 align:middle line:90%
I was involved in that part.

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah, he developed it.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.652 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: He developed it, yeah.

00:03:56.652 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:10%
One of the things I
want to piggyback on

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:10%
is when we had EBE-1 in
captivity from 1947 to 1952,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:10%
there were thousands of
questions that we were trying.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Once we were able to
communicate with him,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
one of the primary
things-- and I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
want to give credit to Linda
Moulton Howe, who actually

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
brought this all
up in interviewing

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:90%
the former handler of EBE-1.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But one of the big questions
was, do you have a soul?

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And once they got
through the explanation

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of what a soul was, EBE-1 said,
absolutely, I have a soul.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:90%
It is eternal.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.381 align:middle line:90%
Every Eben has a soul.

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And they have figured out
how to manipulate that soul.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Now that's all I know about it.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I wanted to bring up

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
was, at least the
Ebens had souls.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: The Greys as well.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's totally true.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And the Ebens, because they
are more a biological being,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
they have personalities,
but the Greys as well.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I've
found pretty interesting

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
because they have gotten
rid of their bodies,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
their biological bodies because
they saw that as a disadvantage

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:90%
to their evolution.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
But problems came with that.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:90%
But they all have some kind--

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:84%
at least in the lower fields
of consciousness from the Greys

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
because they have different
levels of hierarchies.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the lower levels,
they have personalities

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that you can feel,
you can sense if it's

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
a female presence in the room
or if it's a male presence.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
similar to what we

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.075 align:middle line:84%
define as presence, awareness,
consciousness, personality.

00:05:57.075 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Fascinating.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now when we spoke
about the 12 and the different

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
types of Greys
that are out there,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:84%
are they also working with other
civilizations and other beings

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:90%
like the humans out there?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.895 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, they
absolutely are.

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
One of their primarily
goals to the mission

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
is to administer things.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So they had influences
in different planets,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:84%
in different star
systems, and even

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
taken over some of the
legislations and sociological

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
determinations of planets,
even star systems.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I know from other
species that there's

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of talk about
the manipulation thing

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
because genetically evolving
a species can be an advantage.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But it also brings a lot
of distortion and chaos

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to a system, which makes
things de-naturalize.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about human
beings, which are actually

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
like a ape species, they
haven't taken the natural path

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.864 align:middle line:90%
in evolution, but kind of--

00:07:20.864 --> 00:07:21.664 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Jumped.

00:07:21.664 --> 00:07:22.464 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:22.464 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Exactly, exactly.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And that brought a lot
of advantages, clearly.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But it also brought
disadvantages.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, that human
beings feel pretty--

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they're not
connected to their nature

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:90%
in some ways or another.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
A naturally evolved
being would be more

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
in a harmony with nature,
while as human beings--

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they're pretty artificial
in the way they behave.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
They do not see
themselves as animals.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves as
special or something.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And that makes
their whole system

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
on this planet pretty artificial
and creates a lot of chaos.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the Greys are in
contact with different planets.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They have done
genetic manipulation

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:90%
on different other species--

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot of other species.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of discussion
about that, if that is OK.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Amazing.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Now Rick, let's
talk about EBE-1.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you had some
other additional information

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:90%
about how that unfolded?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, once EBE-1 was
able to communicate with us,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:90%
he provided-- it was a male--

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
a plethora of information
about space exploration,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the number of planets
they have visited.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:90%
They were explorers.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:84%
EBE-1 identified
himself and his team--

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of course, the other ones
died in the crash at Roswell--

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
as explorers.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Their job was to explore.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And they knew about
Earth because they

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
had been visiting Earth a lot
for supposedly 2,000 years.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So they come back and check on
the evolution of the planet.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But they have visited
many, many, many others.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But their job was to explore,
and make contact, and not

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
manipulate the planet or
change anything on that planet,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:90%
but observe.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And another thing they were
interested in was technology.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Now you got to
understand, in 1947,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:84%
we weren't able to even perfect
a jet engine at that time.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Germany did.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But the United
States hadn't quite.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:90%
But here the Ebens are.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They were able to travel 38.5
light years in nine months

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
from Zeta Reticuli
to our solar system.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
They have perfected
space travel.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to
explain it to us,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
but we weren't able
to understand them

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:84%
because we would have
to learn their science.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And even though our Los
Alamos scientists, Sandia,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and other scientists were eager
to listen and try to determine

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:90%
how they did this, but--

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and another thing was
difficult for EBE-1

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
was to explain to
us what their time

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:90%
system is compared to ours.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't go by
months, and years, days,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:90%
and hours.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Their hours were
different than us.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
lot of complexity.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And I think that their handler--

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and what Linda Howe
had said and written--

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
that we were smart enough
to try to figure it out.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to-- our
scientists at Los Alamos--

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:90%
hey, we made an atom bomb.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
We figured out now that
what their time system was

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
capable of doing.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that EBE-1 stressed to us

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:90%
was, we're not here to hurt you.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to harm you.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to attack
you or take you over.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We're here to study you
because we placed you here.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, we want to
look at your evolution.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And they've done this with--
and according to what I read

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and what EBE-1
told us was, we've

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.280 align:middle line:84%
been exploring the universe
for thousands of years.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.497 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Correct
me if I'm wrong.

00:11:19.497 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Didn't they also give
us some technology,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:90%
like a device of sorts?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:84%
They gave us a number of
different technologies.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we found
in the crash site at Roswell

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
was a thick piece of Plexiglas.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And we thought it was Plexiglas.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
We weren't, I
think, at the time,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
because he died in 1952, we
had so many artifacts that we

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
found at the crash site that
he was trying to identify.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't able to
explain things to us.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
understand that he's

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different solar
system, a different planet,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.668 align:middle line:84%
a different sociology,
a different science--

00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We wouldn't even
understand the physics

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:90%
or science behind it.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It would
take forever, yeah.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: It was
an energy device.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.338 align:middle line:84%
And we have it, and we've
experimented with it.

00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the things they
did at the Institute

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
for Advanced Study
is identify it.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, we
couldn't figure it out.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, we did.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But they also gave us
other things that we--

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:90%
they gave it to us.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:10%
But unfortunately at the time,
EBE-1 wasn't able to explain

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:10%
to--

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:39.035 align:middle line:10%
How do we explain to a cat or
a dog or some other lower--

00:12:39.035 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: A caveman.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, what
a computer was?

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And they had one of those.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't understand.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't explain exactly
how these things functioned.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, we did.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:90%
He gave us a lot of things.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, we figured
out that one was a computer,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and one was an energy
device, and some

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:90%
were fiber optic systems.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was
some things right now

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring up that were able
to transmit a signal from one

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
point to another
point from distance

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
away without connecting
them, which we have now.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It's called wireless, of course.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
But they had this kind
of a system of wireless.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But we, at the time, couldn't
understand what it was.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I think, in
contrast to the Greys,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
the Ebens were a
pretty defensive,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:90%
non-invasive species.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what I experienced.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys are more
proactive, more pushy

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of way, which
I've found pretty interesting.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But they still stick
to their own rule

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
set, which is pretty
exotic to the way humans

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:90%
understand things.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I cannot stress enough,
that thinking it would be OK

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
to go in someone's bedroom,
their sleeping room,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and observe a human being
sleeping or interact with them,

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to the Greys, that
would be totally OK.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't understand the
way humans react upon that.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think--

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
although, I'm pretty
convinced that Ebens

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:84%
have observed humans very, very
profoundly and very accurately

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and understood how facilities
work, how people live,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
how they take on
houses or something.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, I think they
even went into houses.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.763 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't stand aside
of a bed observing someone.

00:14:51.763 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And the Greys would do that.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The Greys would be
total totally fine.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And this was something to
communicate with them, to say,

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
look, you cannot do that because
people naturally would freak

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.502 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't understand.

00:15:04.502 --> 00:15:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was something that
I found really interesting.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, also share some
of the technology that you had

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to, some of the
extraterrestrial technology.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So I think that the
Ebens would have never made

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
direct contact in the way
it had appeared in Roswell

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:84%
because of their observing
and non-invasive way to think.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But once it was made,
you said it already,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
they brought a lot of
technology to humans.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:84%
They also have their genetics
inside of human beings--

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.630 align:middle line:90%
the Greys as well.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
They both have been at war
for several thousands of years

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
because they both come from
the same star system of Orion.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is finally over.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I think that
a lot of satellite conflicts,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
in some way or another,
were taking place on Earth

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:90%
between these two species.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.482 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But you were
exposed to some technology.

00:16:16.482 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah, technology.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys gave human
governments a lot of technology

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
while still getting
back something for them

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:84%
in order to get in contract
with the Greys' system.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.948 align:middle line:84%
As I already said, the
Greys, if they could,

00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
if people would ask
them, they would

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
love to administer
everything in the universe.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
They are so-- they
have this thought

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
system of getting everything
into a cohesive homogeneous

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:84%
direction in order
to get the universe

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
into the most efficient
evolution that's possible.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Sure, but what
specific technology did you

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:84%
have hands on or were aware
of that you've actually seen?

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So one thing was this
kind of tablet because at that

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
time, they already were
able to use German language,

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.849 align:middle line:84%
probably English as
well, Russian as well,

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:30.543 align:middle line:84%
probably also Chinese, even if
I don't know about the Chinese.

00:17:30.543 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So they were handing
out these kind of--

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Translators, like?

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.958 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It was some
kind of-- yeah,

00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
they used those tablets
where, at one side,

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
you have the hieroglyphs
that they are using.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.610 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom, you have
the German translation,

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.890 align:middle line:90%
which is often a bit off.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.095 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting
something to a computer.

00:17:48.095 --> 00:17:49.367 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's broken German.

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: It's a bit broken.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a little confused.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not broken.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%
The grammar is perfect.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:84%
But things are just sometimes
a little out of place.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And that is when you need to--

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's
an important topic.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, the agenda,
what is the credo?

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:84%
What is their mission
on planet Earth?

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
That's where you need
to check and to recheck

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:90%
what they are talking about.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.000 align:middle line:84%
That is one thing
they gave people.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So in the '50s, we have
this technology advancement

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that the Germans back then had.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure that
they brought some balance

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
to the global system by
giving out technology

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to different nations.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, I don't think
that the United States would

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
have had access to operating
and flying machines

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
if the Greys wouldn't
have had thought

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
it would be beneficial to
place that there at some point.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Different other stuff--

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
interesting thing that

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
occurred to humanity in
the more recent years

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
was that they gave
them access to access

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
time-traveling technology, which
means that they came to a point

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:84%
where they were always warning
the Earth people that they

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
would eventually destroy the
planet and also every stock

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:90%
the Greys had in them.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
better strategies to them

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
was to understand that
humans are continuing

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.910 align:middle line:84%
with bad behavior until
they hit something

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that is so obvious that forces
them to stop the behavior--

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:90%
a cataclysm or something.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think because the Greys
didn't want the worst case

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
scenario, they showed
people what could happen.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that brought
a lot of a turning point

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:84%
to the whole disclosure
topic and to everything

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.178 align:middle line:90%
we see right now.

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So Rick,
what do you think?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well one of the things
EBE-1 told us eventually--

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is just a few
months before he passed away.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
He warned us about
hostile entities

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that were visiting Earth
and hostile planets

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
out there-- planets that
were extremely hostile

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and that would threaten.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And he gave us some
specifics about

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:84%
the different particular race
and where it would probably

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
come from, one being a very,
very close solar system four,

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:90%
five, or six light years away.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What kind of race?

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I believe
it was a praying mantis,

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
but it was an offshoot
of the praying mantis.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know the exact race.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
we did was in the late '60s,

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:90%
there was a crash site.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
recover a particular entity

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:90%
from that crash site.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And that entity fit
the exact description

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:90%
of what EBE-1 had told us about.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, jump forward to
1979, 1980, '81 time period,

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
when President Reagan
came into administration.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure this
occurred during the Carter

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:90%
administration also.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
We were worried now that this
particular entity was on Earth.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was we
had an aggressive program

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:84%
to protect Earth
from the hostile ETs.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we were developing

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
was a star war initiative, a
strategic defense initiative

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that was a prime
program for President

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Reagan and his administration.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.405 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke about
it a number of times.

00:22:07.405 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to go into
the details about how

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:90%
he was afraid.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And that came from-- and this
was what I wasn't going to talk

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:84%
came from this crash site and
what we uncovered and captured.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.653 align:middle line:84%
We had a live one in
captivity at Area 51.

00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's incredible.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But we were able
to develop techniques with

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
assistance of other governments
to put up warning satellites,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
especially the deep space
probes that were going to warn

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
the United States and Earth
of approaching enemies.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: I confirm that.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Would you say there
are civilizations

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
out there that, if
we were attacked,

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:90%
that they would help protect us?

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Totally.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think the overall mass
of lifeforms in the universe,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
we talk about more
than 90% that are

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:90%
very benevolent and friendly.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We have-- and I know that
people were in concern

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
about a specific insectoid
praying mantis being

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:90%
and also one reptilian race.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But I think-- so the Greys put
a lot of effort in bringing

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
warrior-type species together
in order to have a more complex

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and sticking-to-the-rule
system to have defensive lines

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and also in order to protect
the universe because that is

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:90%
their ultimate goal.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:84%
In order to preserve
the tonal dynamics,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
which means to preserve
the flow of the universe,

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to make it non-self-destructive,
to make it a stable system.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:90%
That is their approach.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
That is why they are so invasive
in some places and times.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:84%
The really astonishing
overall mass of the universe

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:90%
is friendly and benevolent.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the
consciousness goes,

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not stick to that
3D or 4D consciousness.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.700 align:middle line:84%
The higher we go, the
more benevolent they are,

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:84%
the more they care
about peace and harmony.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's something
really, really great.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Also, entities coming
from future episodes,

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:84%
future timelines,
they also care a lot

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:90%
about what's happening on Earth.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:90%
They protect this being.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I can also
confirm the shield

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:90%
that's surrounding Earth.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a lot been done

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.170 align:middle line:90%
in order to protect people.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And the overall
mass of them-- super

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:90%
friendly, super benevolent.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, so
what are you saying,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that there isn't
really a threat?

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, there might be a
threat, but there's also

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:90%
a protection for us?

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: True.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So as Richard Doty
correctly said,

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%
there is protection that is
coming either from inside

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
of the planet--
means human beings--

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.440 align:middle line:84%
but also from outside
because some heavily depend

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on on Earth.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Some are really interested in
humanity to evolve correctly.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, species that
go higher in awareness,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
they understand that
we are connected

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to be in
friendship with each other.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is their
approach to the universe.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say, while
there are patterns

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that are unsolved on this
planet at the moment,

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
they also appear in an
open scenario, open system.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But the overall mass
is protecting, loving,

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.237 align:middle line:90%
and benevolent at least.

00:26:06.237 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Fantastic.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, what a
mind-blowing episode.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It's such an honor to have
you here, Tim and Rick.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.673 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:26:17.673 --> 00:26:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah, I agree.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.142 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:26:24.142 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ANNOUNCER: Next on
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Some meetings were
with only one individual Grey.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Some where with up
to three of them.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an artificial technology
that you're interacting with,

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:90%
with a biological awareness.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You can sense that there
is a individual soul that

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:90%
is communicating with you.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:90%
