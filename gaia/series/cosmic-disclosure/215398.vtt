>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:10%
we are with Sébastien Martin,
a retired chairman of the board

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:10%
of a multinational business
who has participated in covert

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:10%
remote viewing assignments
for a CIA analyst.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking about
the dark pyramid of Alaska.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, Sébastien.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.648 align:middle line:84%
>> SEBASTIEN MARTIN: Thank you,
Emery, for having me again.

00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what is this
Alaskan dark pyramid?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, I really was
involved in remote viewing

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced to this
Iraqi stargate that was made out

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
of this core earth material.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I was
also asked to remote view

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
a structure in Alaska,
which basically was

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.239 align:middle line:90%
comprised of the same material.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And I did see it
with my own eyes,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:84%
obviously, using
remote viewing, but I

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
was told that this structure was
known to other people and also

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:90%
the SSP.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So through my work and the
people I was communicating with,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
one of the SSP officers
who went to Alaska

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to see the dark pyramid
talked about it to the people

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm in touch with.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And that man is called James.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:90%
We called him James.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
But he basically had very
interesting information

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it, saying that
the pyramid was created out

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of that same earth
material that got extracted

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
from the inner earth
and built on site

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
in that cave or structure, I
guess, that was dug or created.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It was not originally hollow.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It was created to place
that structure there.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I did ask,
when did that happen?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And he said 275,000 years ago.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So the Anunnaki were
the ones who did all of this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The same people
that were involved

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
with the stargate in
Iraq had this structure

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.945 align:middle line:90%
built for their own purpose.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:25.745 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the
same material--

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: The same material.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --as the stargate?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes, exactly
the same material.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.157 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how
large is this pyramid?

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:33.725 align:middle line:90%
And where in Alaska is it?

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It's huge.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
It's bigger than
the Giza pyramids.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It's massive.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a massive conductor.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering, what's the
main purpose of this structure?

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And you probably
have seen footage

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs coming out of erupting
volcanoes or these sort

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
of things right around the
world, like Japan and so on.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And to some extent,
that still occurs.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
They are still using the plasma
energy from those volcanoes

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate their crafts,
and they store them down there.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happens
with the pyramid,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:84%
but for larger motherships that
don't fit within those craters.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this an active
working pyramid for current

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:90%
motherships?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.535 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And the function
of those pyramids

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
is very different than the
craters from volcanoes,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is that they can send
out a beam of energy

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:84%
into space, not on earth, into
space, that can be refueling

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:84%
those crafts that won't even be
seen by our current satellites,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
completely sheltered
and protected

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
from any kind of
visions from earth.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they regenerate their
crafts from those energy

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:90%
beams on earth.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
know many other sources

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.380 align:middle line:90%
like the dark pyramid in Alaska.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
But we have events,
situations that--

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
how do we know
about this pyramid?

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.277 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about something
that I've experienced

00:04:06.277 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:90%
through the people I know.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know much
about it beforehand.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So in the 1970s or since
the 1970s, for some reason,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot of disappearances and
events happened around that

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.182 align:middle line:84%
Alaskan triangle, which is close
to Mount Denali and Mount Grace.

00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And where
is the pyramid.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:10%
>> MARTIN: The pyramid
is close to Mount Denali,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.068 align:middle line:10%
so deep underground.

00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, it's underground.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Oh, yes.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it completely
buried or is there a space

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.050 align:middle line:90%
around it?

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, it's buried.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.568 align:middle line:84%
It can only be accessed through
different shafts or tunnels.

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Oh, you
physically can get to it.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Oh, yes, of course.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Army personnel use the
space on a regular basis.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So to what extent is
it to help the SSP?

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Those people have access from
different US bases in Alaska.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I know of a few
locations or a few shafts

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:90%
where you can enter in.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:90%
You go really deep underground.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
It's probably, like,
25 stories deep.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramid being so huge
and having different access

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
doors, you even have various
accesses to get to the pyramid.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.625 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you
just go down a shaft--

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Go down a shaft--

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.375 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: --straight
into the pyramid.

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
No, you have different
doors blocking the access

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to the pyramid, massive
doors, like metallic doors.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who's in control
of the security of the Black

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid?

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: The SSP
uses the space,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:90%
but the US Army controls it.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the government, the
US government has access to it.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And it might seem
far-fetched or something,

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
but they also have access to the
bases, so they can send food.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, these people working
down there have to be fed.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:90%
They have to wash their clothes.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:90%
They have the whole system.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.325 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: A huge
logistic issue, right?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.125 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
there are some tunnels

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:90%
all across the US and Canada.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And Alaska is obviously
filled with those tunnels too.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So you have various accesses
to that pyramid complex.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of human
personnel goes through that.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And they can go
through with cars

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and everything that's large
enough, trucks, you name it.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like a--
just a one-man shaft

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
that can just go in, and
that's the only access.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why were you asked
to remote view this pyramid?

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So as part
of my training, I guess,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or when I was being tested,
and then I was told about

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:90%
the stargate.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:84%
For me to understand
the type of material,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I was given that as a
reference point at the time.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was not something
they wanted to elaborate on.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
It only came years later
when I asked more about it

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:90%
that I got more information.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, I knew
very little about it.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that,
OK, it existed.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:84%
But as to know about its
function, or who was in charge

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
or who was doing with
this, I had no idea.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I knew nothing about it.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was for me to be more
familiar with the material

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Very basic stuff.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:90%
It was not elaborate.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
It was just like, view
this, see it exists,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can relate
it to the stargate.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know much
about the Anunnaki either.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
I got introduced to.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically how I
knew that the pyramid existed,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and I could see it
in its full glory.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
But I could feel its
energy the same way

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
as I could feel the same
energy from the stargate.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
vibrant energy for me.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
personnel working there

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
would feel the same way, if they
would have the same feedback.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Because as a remote
viewer, when you go there,

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
you access different types
of energies and frequencies

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:90%
than most people.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not quite sure
how those kind of energies

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
will affect the
personnel on site.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.730 align:middle line:84%
The way it affected me,
the way I could feel--

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I could feel this intelligence
emanating from it almost.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It was not just a
basic frequency.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
was almost like living.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How many times
have you been there?

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Just the once.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.466 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you
mentioned the Anunnaki.

00:08:34.466 --> 00:08:37.895 align:middle line:84%
Who told you about the Anunnaki
was in control of the pyramid?

00:08:37.895 --> 00:08:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Or built the pyramid.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So the operative
I was working with

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
told me when I questioned
or had more questions

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:90%
about the stargate in Iraq.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
She mentioned that
the pyramid was

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
created by the same people,
which is the Anunnaki.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And the history of it
came from her as well.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And this operative
is the CIA officer?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:84%
She was obviously working
for the Department

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
of Defense and Department
of State and so on.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned
the Alaskan triangle.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So the Alaskan-- or
what is known as the Alaskan

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:90%
triangle is--

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of an area of
pretty much like the Bermuda

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Triangle, where you have
people disappearing.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:10%
In fact, double the average
of disappearance in America

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:10%
happens in Alaska.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's double the national
average-- that's very unusual--

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.370 align:middle line:90%
since the 1970s.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Hmm.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So a lot
of people disappear.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
regular people, civilians,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
military personnel.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So not on a
plane or a boat, just--

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Oh, airplanes could
also disappeared there, too.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:90%
They have disappeared.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.763 align:middle line:90%
People try to search for them.

00:09:49.763 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't find them.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
There was even a story
of a man who went

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:90%
searching for the Dark Pyramid.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:90%
And he vanished.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why are
people disappearing?

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I believe it's to
do with many different factors.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
One, people could
simply get lost simply

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
because they lose
their own orientation.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid itself
generates a frequency

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:84%
that will completely mess up
with the regular compasses.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So the needle will just go
around and around and around.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And the airplanes crashed
in that location pretty much

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:90%
like the Bermuda Triangle.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Same idea.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
They would crash
because they don't

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
know where they are anymore.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what was discovered
by the US seismologist in 1992

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
with that Chinese
nuclear explosion?

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.582 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Right.

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we
have to go back to 1982,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
when China was criticized for
detonating their nuclear bombs

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:90%
above ground.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So they started detonating
their bombs below ground.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:10%
And so in 1992, they detonated,
I believe, a one-megaton bomb

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:10%
underground, which got seen by
the seismologists in America.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
They could feel the
detonation underground.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And while they were observing
those events on the needle,

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:84%
they could see that there was
a cavity underneath Alaska

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:90%
that they never knew about.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
That's a story that, to me, is
very controversial, because we

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
actual confirmation

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:90%
that such event happened.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We know about the
nuclear bomb from China.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't know much about
the seismologist describing

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:90%
these events.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Doug Mutschler or
Mutschler, who was working

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
for the counter-intelligence
agencies and apparently

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
was working in Alaska
and saw a broadcast

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
on his television set
at the base talking

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.842 align:middle line:90%
about the Dark Pyramid.

00:11:55.842 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, goodness.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And so he basically
went to ask the local TV

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, we don't
know what you are talking about.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And the program apparently
got aired and then got

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
destroyed and removed
by the Men in Black.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And so he came
up with a story that said,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:90%
this is how I knew about this.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is that a
disinformation story maybe or--

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I believe it
could potentially be.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.933 align:middle line:90%
As to why, to maybe tell--

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who would
be telling him that?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.058 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It's mostly the
Chinese, I believe, at the time.

00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I think he just wanted to
scare the Chinese about what

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
kind of technology that they
uncovered through this blast,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and what they could use
to their own advantage.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, the only events

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in 1992, which
is when that bomb exploded,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:84%
was an actual cavity on
a small island that was

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:90%
discovered underneath Alaska.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But we're looking at the core
of the Earth, which is way deep.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same situation.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there was a mass
that was discovered

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:84%
in 1982 through the
release of his bomb,

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
but it was not as far-fetched
as a dark pyramid underground

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Alaska.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And it would have
definitely not aired

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
on national television
or local television.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No way.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.198 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: So I don't--

00:13:25.198 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I had many question
marks about that myself.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Is it that somehow
this man wanted

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
Dark Pyramid somewhat,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
just because he knew
of its existence,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:90%
but not through the same way?

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
situation really occurred.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole
story is far-fetched

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and not based on anything.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that
the structure exists.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it with my own
eyes using remote viewing.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.747 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So there's
this anonymous testimony.

00:13:54.747 --> 00:13:58.113 align:middle line:84%
We'll call him John Smith, the
Western Electric engineer guy.

00:13:58.113 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Right, yes.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.495 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So he allegedly claims
to have worked at the Dark

00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:03.295 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid.

00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you
tell us about this?

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, for all we
know, this is, I believe,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:90%
what Linda Moulton Howe--

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:90%
as a whistleblower.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
This man reached out
to her through emails

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and called himself John Smith
and that his dad was actually

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
working for General Electric
and went to the Dark Pyramid.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:90%
He was hired to work there.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And he described himself
going through this shaft,

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:84%
going underground, and
seeing this Dark Pyramid.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:84%
It's, again, a story that we
heard from someone somewhat

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:84%
anonymous who
provided information

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.802 align:middle line:84%
about their own dad,
who may have been there.

00:14:47.802 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know
about the paperwork,

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.402 align:middle line:84%
if it's even genuine
either or not.

00:14:52.402 --> 00:14:56.308 align:middle line:84%
I have many question
marks about that too.

00:14:56.308 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
To the extent that the
events that he described,

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:84%
like the metallic
doorways I mentioned,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:90%
he mentioned it as well.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there was
some kind of truth, again,

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:90%
to the events.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But the situation or
the people involved

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:90%
may have been different.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe it may have
been from someone else

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that that person knew,
not necessarily the dad.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a story
that he heard, but not

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:90%
from a firsthand experience.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What did you see?

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever look in the
pyramid, remote viewing?

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So I did not
look inside the pyramid.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I could see around
the structure.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So I could see
people moving around.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.215 align:middle line:90%
I saw vehicles.

00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:40.590 align:middle line:84%
When I remote
viewed the place, I

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
saw vehicles driving
around the pyramid.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So the surface, the ground
is pretty smooth and flat.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:84%
You have imagined having rocks
around and stuff like that.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.575 align:middle line:84%
But the space itself around the
pyramid is fairly large as well.

00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Has to be--

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --enormous because
we're talking about larger than

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.260 align:middle line:90%
the pyramid of Giza.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
the walls around

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:90%
it were like mountain rock.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
It was not smooth, like from
an actual surface from--

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
like a building that's
been erected there.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
It was built directly
inside the rock structure.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And it was going all the way up.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even
see the top of it.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But the surface, the flat,
the floor, was very manicured.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
they poured concrete.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And they have an
infrastructure right there.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And they had buildings
all around it.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Sebastien,
for the audience,

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a
pyramid bigger than Giza.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: 25 floors down
from the surface of Alaska.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:90%
And there is space around it.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that means
there's a roof in here,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
a ceiling of some sort And
how far from the pyramid

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
is there space?

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.513 align:middle line:90%
Because you mentioned buildings.

00:17:00.513 --> 00:17:01.313 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a dome structure.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid
itself has a base.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:84%
And from the base, it
extends on all sides

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and mostly on the left
and the right-hand side,

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
from my viewpoint
as a remote viewer.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
I could see that there was
a rock wall in a dome shape.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.537 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically
going all the way up

00:17:25.537 --> 00:17:26.620 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the pyramid.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Where I was standing
from my viewpoint

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
was basically where
the structures,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
the buildings were slightly
above the pyramid, so built up.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So people would have office
spaces and lab technicians

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:90%
and army personnel.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.840 align:middle line:84%
All of these people
were on that side.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But there were also
some structures

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.615 align:middle line:84%
on the right-hand side
from my viewpoint.

00:17:55.615 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So from the side
of the pyramid--

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
you could imagine the
pyramid like this.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And you could see some of
the structures down below.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So you could access, too,
by going through stairs

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:90%
or an elevator shaft.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But the complex where
I was looking from

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
was definitely more structured
with different office spaces

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.673 align:middle line:90%
and canteens and everything.

00:18:18.673 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:90%
So just on that side--

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And a road,
you said, as well.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: The road-- yeah.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So not so much of a
road around the pyramid.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely more
like a flat surface

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that the vehicles
could go around.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:90%
There was no--

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see any lines like
roadways anywhere on the ground.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So those vehicles were mostly
moving personnel from place

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to place around the
pyramid and so on.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that the
frequency of the force that

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is around that pyramid could
affect the people working there.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So they have
massive protections.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The glass panel that I could see
from a viewpoint from the inside

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:90%
was pretty thick.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So it was definitely protecting
them from certain frequency

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:90%
or radiation or--

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But they definitely
were trying to create

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
a division between the
pyramid and themselves.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:90%
So around the pyramid--

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to imagine that
this structure has been there

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:90%
for 275,000 years.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But since then, and
from my viewpoint,

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing that structure
with modern technology

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
from regular housing
facilities and office spaces

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:90%
from the humans working there.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So they built those
places to facilitate

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:90%
their work around the pyramid.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.047 align:middle line:90%
That's basically what I saw.

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What are
the entrances like?

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.145 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
into this facility?

00:19:44.145 --> 00:19:44.945 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
entrances that you have,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:84%
man-made shafts that
are close to the pyramid

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:84%
that people use to go in
and out of the facility

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
as well, more like an
emergency exit kind of thing.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But most of the in-and-outs
of the pyramid structures

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
is actually from different bases
and underground tunnels that

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:90%
could go for hundreds of miles.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So Fort Wainwright has an access
point that is used by the SSP,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
but also by US Army
personnel to provide food

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:84%
to these people that
work there every day.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Is it a road?

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Is it a maglev train?

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It's a tunnel.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --some
sort of technology--

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: There's tunnel.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.065 align:middle line:84%
No, there's a
tunnel access point

00:20:28.065 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that you can go
there with trucks.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Not so much-- railroads are
more deeper underground.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- those ones are used
are the railways on one line,

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:90%
and they go super fast.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Those access points
are not from Alaska.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:90%
They are from the mainland US.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: What you have
to realize is recently,

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese tried to
infiltrate Fort Wainwright.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.485 align:middle line:84%
They went in, they said,
oh, we're just tourists,

00:20:58.485 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're just trying
to take pictures.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
They literally barged in
through the security checkpoint

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and tried to use a
drone to film the base,

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
around the base to find
out about the entry point.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.518 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: That's real.

00:21:11.518 --> 00:21:12.758 align:middle line:90%
That's went into the news.

00:21:12.758 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's pretty ballsy.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So obviously, we
know that the Chinese try to--

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
since the 1992 event,
they tried to know more

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:90%
about the Alaskan pyramid.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And so they are trying
to find out more about it

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.185 align:middle line:90%
and see how they can spy on it.

00:21:29.185 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's
going to be difficult.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well,
yeah, of course.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible
for them to access it,

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:90%
but they always try.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How many Chinese
remote viewers are there?

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: A lot.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese government
have used that technology

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning
of remote viewing,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and before that, even
with the Russians,

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:90%
when they were working on it.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, when the
Russians worked on it,

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese worked on
it, and then the US

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
decided to start
their own program

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:90%
with the stargate program.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they started before them.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you explain the
plasma energy that's given off

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:84%
by the Dark Pyramid that's
loading ships and what else are

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:90%
they using it for?

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I believe that's the
main purpose is to regenerate

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:90%
those motherships in space.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
The same technology was
used with the Giza pyramids.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Chinese
actually have

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:84%
decided to talk
about those orbs that

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.420 align:middle line:84%
disrupted their own satellite
signals from the Giza pyramid

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
plateau that were
seen and observed

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and are constantly, routinely
being observed in that location.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, they know
there's something going on.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It also made the news because
they talked about it themselves.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So the Alaskan pyramid does not
produce the same disturbances

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:84%
for satellites or anything
else because, one,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
it's in a very remote location,
not a very touristic locations

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:90%
like the Giza pyramids.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And two is because it has
a whole different purpose

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%
on a larger scale where,
when they make it functional,

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
they make sure that there is
nothing interfering with what's

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:90%
in space in between.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It's very timed.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be
careful in the use of it

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:90%
because it's very powerful.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how is this energy
from the Black Pyramid used

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and controlled?

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, so they
obviously generate that energy

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:90%
from the pyramid.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And how they can
send a signal up

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
is all to do with
science, I guess,

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
where they were able
to reverse engineer

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:90%
to send off that energy beam.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we talk about,
what has never been asked,

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is that the motherships
was used by the Anunnaki.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So why are they
using it for today?

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.333 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And can we harvest
that and use it for us?

00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, that's exactly
what they're using it for today.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, they are?

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:84%
That same energy is used
today for motherships.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But they are not
Anunnaki anymore.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Today, they're the SSP.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: The SSP.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.933 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes, because
they know it's functional.

00:24:08.933 --> 00:24:10.660 align:middle line:84%
They reverse-engineered
the technology.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
understand how that worked.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.037 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Does the
SSP have a mothership?

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, of course.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.857 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: How many?

00:24:17.857 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Hundreds.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly, but
it's not in the thousands.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:25.083 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And they're utilizing
this pyramid for the refueling.

00:24:25.083 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: One of them, yes.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
different technologies.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: The older version
of the SSP is actually using

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:84%
the plasma technology to
regenerate their ships.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They have more, better
technologies today

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that they also
reverse engineered

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
from other downed crafts
that they are using today.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Sebastien, thank
you for coming on the show.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.022 align:middle line:90%
You're a wealth of information.

00:24:47.022 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, thank
you for having me again.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith,
and this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
