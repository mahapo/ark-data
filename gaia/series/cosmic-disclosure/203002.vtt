[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:19.117 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:20.950 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty, a
retired counterintelligence

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:10%
agent who served in
the Air Force Office

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately involved
with UFO ET related content.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here, Emery.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.068 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Now, there's
many undisclosed projects

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
out there that three-letter
agencies are involved with.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But you were involved with
one called the Aviary.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, back in about
1980, a group of people

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:84%
got together-- a group of
people within the government got

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
together to form a
close-knit group to talk

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:90%
about the subject of UFOs.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And the initial make up of
the group was about 10 people.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And these people met
periodically, a couple of times

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:90%
a year, sometimes more often.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And we spoke about and
we gathered information

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
about what the government
knew relating to UFOs and ET

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.725 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, who
created it and why?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Who was like behind it?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Who was the main person.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, I was informed--

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I got a message
from my headquarters

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
telling me that
I was going TDY--

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to a temporary duty
assignment for the people

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:84%
who don't understand
what that means--

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to Washington, DC and I was
going to a classified location.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And the classified
location was TQR 7.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:90%
That was on my orders.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I remember it distinctly.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what that meant.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Really, seriously, I had went
on other classified locations,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:90%
such as Area 51.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what that meant.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the admin
person in the office.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what does this mean?

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
He says, you don't know?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I'm going
TDY to Washington, DC.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Is that the location I'm
supposed to be going to?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Is that a code or
some place on a map?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't know.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to know.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, a short time
later, through a secure message

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
that came in with an address
in Falls Church, Virginia.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I show up.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.227 align:middle line:84%
I go to Washington and get a
rental vehicle, drive there.

00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what it was about.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Honest to God, I didn't have
any idea what this was about.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:90%
I get to the scene.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
There's two security people
checking my credentials.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:90%
And I walked in.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a regular house.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And under the house
was a meeting room--

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
a conference room--
large conference room.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I was told to sit
in this lounge area.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
There was people in there I
had no idea who they were.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who they were.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The first person that then came
in that I knew was Kit Green.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:10%
I worked with Kit Green before.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:90%
So I got up and-- hey, Kit.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Now I got somebody I knew.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So we sat there and
we talked for a while.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
this all about?

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.315 align:middle line:90%
He said, you'll find out.

00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, he was
already briefed into it.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.815 align:middle line:84%
So we went down to
the conference room.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
We got together and a certain
person came and introduced

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
themselves and said, we
formed this group for reasons.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
We formed this group to,
number one, secretly--

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
the word secretly--
secretly look into the US

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.690 align:middle line:84%
government's program on the
investigation of UFO activity

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
activity on planet--

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It was later
extended into Canada.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But at that meeting,
it was United States.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.863 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, hmm, OK.

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I had been briefed
on the program.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:90%
That sounds good to me.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing that came
across is we have limitations.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
this and we're going

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:90%
to do this very clandestinely.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do it and
we're going to report back,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have any support
from the United States

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.905 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So let's
talk about the leader

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of this that got it
together, his name.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And also let's go down the list
of the others and their code

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
names and also what their
mission and responsibility

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:90%
is for this group.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: OK, Richard Helms,
the former director of CIA,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:10%
was the one that brought
everybody together.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know why I was chosen.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But after he made
that statement,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
then everybody
introduced themselves.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And the first person
to introduce himself

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:90%
was Dr. Kit Green.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
He was a neurosurgeon from
the University of Michigan.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
He worked for the CIA.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
He had intimate knowledge about
ET physiology and anatomy.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Next person was Bruce Maccabee.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:10%
He was a scientist with the
Office of Naval Intelligence.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.893 align:middle line:10%
He really only introduced
himself by name

00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:10%
and that he worked for
the United States Navy.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:10%
He was a civilian with
United States Navy.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Puthoff introduced himself
as being a scientist formerly

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:10%
with SRI, working for
the United States Navy

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:10%
on very highly
classified projects.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Ron Pandolfi-- now, I
knew Ron Pandolfi too.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.755 align:middle line:10%
Ron Pandolfi worked for the CIA.

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And then Ernie Kellerstrass,
he worked for the United States

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Air Force, civilian employee
at Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
He had examined UFO
artifacts in the past.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:10%
Captain Robert Collins,
United States Air Force,

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:10%
he was an avionics specialist.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And he had some dealings
with the examination

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
of some alien
communications or avionics.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
what all he did.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Me, I introduced myself
as Special Agent Rick

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Doty, United States
Air Force Office

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
of Special Investigations,
Special Agent.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Don't know what else to say.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Then there was Dan Smith.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:10%
Dan Smith was a civilian.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:10%
And he was vouched
for by Richard Helms.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Dan said, I work
for the government.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I interface with a number
of different agencies.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also a member of
MUFON I think APRO, MUFON,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:90%
and another UFO agency.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I have
interfaces with them.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
two other people

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
in the room that never
introduced themselves.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:90%
They were sitting in the back.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I presumed they were security.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.032 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because they
never said anything.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Nobody acknowledged them.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:90%
They were in suits.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they were armed.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Probably CIA security, I
would guess, although I

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:90%
didn't know that for a fact.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:10%
And then John Alexander
stood up, identified himself

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:10%
as United States Army, works
at a number of different ARMY

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:10%
security commands--

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:10%
positions within ARMY
security commands.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:10%
And then Scott Jones, who was
the aide to Senator Claiborne

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:10%
Pell of Rhode Island.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And now, he apologized
to us-- the group--

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:90%
for Senator Pell's absence.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So I guess he was supposed
to be there, but he wasn't.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:90%
He had other plans.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, Scott is a very
interesting person.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:90%
He worked within that DARPA.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
He worked within the
Defense Nuclear Agency.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
He worked within the United
States Navy intelligence.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
He had a vast knowledge of
a lot of different things

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
within the UFO community
and just investigation

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs and incidents
involving Navy personnel.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
group that was there.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Helms talked
about the current state

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
government's involvement

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
with UFOs and extraterrestrial
investigation.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:90%
It was a generic speech.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't anything specific.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, we've been doing
this for a long time.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
We've gathered a
lot of information

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of more
information out there

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be gathered.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And he went on and on and on.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And then each person got
up and said something else.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Not me, because I didn't have
anything else to contribute.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he gave
us an assignment.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Helms says, I'm no
longer Director of CIA.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a private citizen.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:90%
But I was chosen.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't say who chose him.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:90%
I was chosen to form this group.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So you take that the way it's
meant, that he was the boss.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you to find
the most interesting cases.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:90%
I want you to meet again.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think there
was a certain time

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:90%
period, a month or something.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
I want everybody

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:90%
to just talk amongst themselves.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And then we talked.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:90%
We sat around and talked.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only one
that I actually

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
really got in conversations with
was Kip, because I knew Kip.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Hal Puthoff seemed
very interested in me

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:90%
because of something I had done.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And in that time period, I
was investigating the Paul

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Bennewitz case.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
And he seemed to know about it.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
how he knew about it,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
because It was highly classified
going through my chain.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And how does somebody that works
for Naval Intelligence know.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:90%
You know, it doesn't make sense.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Kit didn't know about it.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
talking about the incident

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.677 align:middle line:90%
in Bentwaters.

00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know anything about it.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- I never
heard of the case.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Others in the room did.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Pandolfi seem to know a lot.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Scott Jones really
knew a lot about it.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And we talked about it.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
We met there for
four or five hours.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
exactly how long.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to
have lunch tomorrow

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
at this particular restaurant
in Alexandria, Virginia.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we went
back to our hotel.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Kit was-- stayed at
the same hotel I did.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
I think Scott Jones did too.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.800 align:middle line:90%
We got together that night.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.042 align:middle line:84%
Scott really drilled me
about a lot of things.

00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next
morning, we went

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:90%
to eat with the rest of them.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.305 align:middle line:90%
We didn't discuss anything.

00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:90%
It was purely unclassified.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.425 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And we signed a
security oath inside the room.

00:10:41.425 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Of course.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I was
really confused.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I went back to New Mexico
scratching my head.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It sounds
like a very confusing--

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like, what am
I going to do with this?

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And what are they going to
do with that information?

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
The Aviary group and
these code names,

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:90%
where did they come from?

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.435 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: They came from a guy
by the name of Jaime Shandera.

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, Jaime had no connections
to the UFO community.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:10%
He was a producer of
commercials and so forth

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:10%
in California out of a company
called Brown Enterprise.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It was something to
do with Paramount.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:90%
He's just a private citizen.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
He's never been in the military
intelligence or anything.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But somehow they found
out he could remote view.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I should say, he
could remote view.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he really knew
what it was at the time.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, he was
friends with Bill Moore.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:10%
Bill Moore, he wrote the
"Philadelphia Experiment"

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:10%
and the first book on Roswell.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:10%
Bill Moore was a control
asset for the office

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:10%
of this special investigation.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:90%
He was one of our assets.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And not to do with anything--
not having anything

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
to do with UFOs, he had
contact with a person

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
in the Soviet
Union, a scientist.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:90%
He was friends of him.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So we used Bill Moore
in a roundabout way

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to contact the scientist
and to flip that scientist

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:90%
in to working for us.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:90%
And this is old news.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not classified anymore.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Bill Moore figured
out we had a group.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Bill Moore confronted
me about this group.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, how do you know
about any group like that?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:90%
He said, Jaime told me.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, OK.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:90%
So I left it at that.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I reported it to the
group immediately.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I reported it to Kit Green.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, ah,
don't worry about it.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:90%
You know, he's a nobody.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know who he is.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, Jaime
Shandera somehow--

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
maybe remote viewed,
I don't know--

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
figured out the
names of everybody.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But I actually think the
names came from somebody--

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the group's names.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And Jaime named us The Aviary.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And sometime in the late '80s--

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:90%
'84, '85-- we were at a meeting.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:90%
And we were told we had a name.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:90%
That we were all bird names.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:90%
We didn't care.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in the group even
cared about the Aviary

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
or about names
associated with us.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:90%
So we were supposedly named.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't really
care what our names were.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But over a period of
time, we learned names.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recall everyone,
because three different times

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:90%
the names were changed.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I was first Hawk.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And then I became Pelican.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Hawk went from, I think, Hal
Puthoff to another person.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Owl was Puthoff.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And then he was--

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was very confusing.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't care.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even pay
any attention to that.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So the Aviary was on the
outside of our group.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:90%
We met once.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:10%
And at that particular meeting,
Clark Clifford was in charge.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:10%
Richard Helms wasn't there.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:10%
He was sick.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:10%
And he told us, we're
going to end all contacts

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:10%
with these outside people.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:90%
And he named the people.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was one particular
member of the group

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that was kicked out because
we think he had a big mouth.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going to--

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to talk about
that person at this time,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
because it was quite
derogatorily done.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.107 align:middle line:84%
I didn't agree
with what they did.

00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
members of the group who

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
spoke up very boastly
about getting rid of him

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:90%
without due cause.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, at that meeting,
disassociated ourselves

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:90%
with the Aviary.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.752 align:middle line:84%
So in the public view, there
was a group called the Aviary.

00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of people
wrote about the Aviary,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
because Jaime Shandera
publicized it.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
He called-- but the one thing he
did was he misnamed everybody.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, we didn't
know who we were.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that I was
ended up with was Falcon.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't the
original Falcon.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was
contributed to me

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:90%
came through Richard Helms.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually
the real Falcon.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I was just a member
of this group.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:90%
And we stayed that way.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we were prohibited from
even talking about the Aviary

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
because it was already
out in the public.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.408 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's probably good
that that happened because it's

00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:90%
a good disinformation.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not
exactly what happened

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever he was reporting out
there-- the whistleblower.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right, exactly.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So we were prohibited from
naming each other these

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and disavowing
those other people.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And in this meantime,
a lot of things

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that occurred within
the government,

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
President Reagan publicly
talked about UFOs.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We were told beforehand by
people within that group--

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.715 align:middle line:90%
Scott Jones told us--

00:16:09.715 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
President Reagan is going to
give a speech on such-a-such

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
President Reagan is going to
do this on such-a-such a day.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:84%
President Reagan had Steven
Spielberg in to the White House

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
for a private showing on
a certain-- certain day.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:90%
That was "ET."

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- what Reagan said
that was in the press is true.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Because Reagan said that later.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I did say that
because I know what we do,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:90%
I know what we have out West.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say Area 51.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:90%
But he said out West.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So all these things were
happening really, really fast.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, at some
point, about 1985,

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
we were told the
group is disbanded.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to meet anymore.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So the group was
going to be dissolved.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that five
years we were together,

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:90%
we didn't do a whole lot.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:90%
We met.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:90%
We talked.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:09.190 align:middle line:90%
We brought up a lot of issues.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
We were told that "The Yellow
Book" and "The Red Book"

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:84%
were real and that we
were going to see them.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And explain
to the listeners,

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
you know, what this
Yellow and Red book are.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: "The Yellow Book"
was created by the Ebens.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete historical
facts about their exploration

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:90%
of the planet Earth.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It's in a-- almost like a little
rectangular device or almost

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:90%
like an iPad.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it,
holographic symbols appear.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.190 align:middle line:90%
And then wording appears.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And whatever language you
speak appears on this.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:90%
And it gives the entire history.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is,
you'd have to sit there

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:90%
for probably two years.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Because once you give that
up and pick it back up again,

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:90%
it starts over.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no way of
manipulating it.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:90%
I only saw a little bit of it.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
"The Red Book" is the United
States government's book

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:84%
on their entire investigation
or contacts with UFOs

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
That book-- regardless
of what people say,

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
regardless of people
arguing about it--

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:90%
the book starts in 1947.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't start in 1907, like
some people have reported,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
or 1923, or all these
other-- it starts in 1947.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It starts with a Truman report--

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
a report to Truman on
the crash of Roswell.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:84%
That's when "The
Red Book" starts.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to-- well,
at least at that point

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:90%
it was up to 1980.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:59.058 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
happened from 1947 to 1980

00:18:59.058 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:90%
is contained in "The Red Book."

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's a regular book.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:84%
It was so vast, it contained
so much information,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that it was almost impossible
for anybody to read everything.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe somebody did.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:90%
We had cursory access to it.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We looked at it and
that was about it.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:84%
When "The Yellow Book"
and "The Red Book"

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:90%
was brought into the room--

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and this was sometime
after our first meeting.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a couple of years later,
three or four years later--

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
it was brought in by military
people in a certain container.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And the pages of "The Red
Book" was the special pages

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:90%
that couldn't be Xeroxed.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be copied.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It would burn up if
they would be copied.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.758 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of-- as you know,

00:19:42.758 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
there's top secret
documents that

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
were fit in certain containers
that you couldn't copy.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But the military
brought them in.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Military--

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're the
security for all that stuff.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
what they're carrying.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly, exactly.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --for you guys.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.938 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They open it up,
leave it there, leave,

00:19:56.938 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and then come back
and pick it up and--

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
couriers, I guess, took it
back to wherever it was stored.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Now, did your team
ever recover any metals

00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:05.345 align:middle line:90%
or artifacts--

00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:84%
ET artifacts, that
is, and metals?

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We were shown reports
of recovery of objects, metals.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
One report was a
really lengthy report.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
thorough report.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It was a recovery of
these pieces of metal.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a metallurgical
analysis of the metals.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was the interpretation
of the scientists

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:90%
of what these things were.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And the consensus
was, by the report,

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is that these things were,
in fact, extraterrestrial

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
because you couldn't find these
elements on the planet Earth.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the substance that
these things were made out of

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:90%
is not found here.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
know what it was.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
only one I can remember.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
One particular time
we did an operation

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in
Michigan regarding

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
a vast number of UFO sightings
that were occurring up there.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.813 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The whole group of you?

00:21:07.813 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Only eight of us that
went, not the whole group.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I think in
'85 there was probably 15.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was a rash
of UFO sightings

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
near Wurtsmith Air
Force Base, which

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
is in the upper part of
the peninsula of Michigan.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:90%
And we interviewed some people.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I was the only one
that really had

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:90%
the credentials to do anything.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:90%
So I did all the legwork.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had credentials, so
I could go in the base,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:90%
I could interview people.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But I was ordered not to make
contact with any intelligence

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:90%
officers on the base.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So I had to do this
all clandestinely.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
We had false IDs and
things like that.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
what I was posing as,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:90%
but it was a pretty good cover.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But we learned by being
up there for about a week,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a little
bit more than a week,

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
that these sightings
were, in fact, our people.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It was a test being conducted.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Because about
halfway through this,

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
information that

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
didn't coincide with
regular UFO sighting

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
with a maybe extraterrestrial
notation on it.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to the group
leader, who was Kit Green.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, Kit,
something's wrong here.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:90%
We got a problem.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, these things
don't make sense to me.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:84%
These crafts-- I mean, they
were black-- the helicopters.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But they were Hueys, They
weren't some unidentified--

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:38.702 align:middle line:84%
I think this is something that
maybe the government's doing.

00:22:38.702 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And Kit said, well,
let's find out.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:90%
And we went up the chain.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Well I went up the chain.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:90%
And nobody said anything.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.170 align:middle line:90%
So we continued to--

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
but then about a week later,
maybe eight days later,

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:84%
we got a report that,
hey, cut it off.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:90%
That's all they told us.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So they're testing
something out there obviously.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were
testing something.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.752 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And people
were seeing this.

00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:05.762 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The base security--
the base security--

00:23:05.762 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
they were doing a lot of things
in what they call the WSA--

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:90%
the weapons storage area.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:84%
That's where the nuclear
weapons are stored for the,

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I think they had B-52s
there at Wurtsmith.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
the operation was.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
That's really the only
operation we ever went on.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, in 1986,
we were regenerated,

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I guess you might say.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.260 align:middle line:84%
We all got messages to
report to Dayton, Ohio.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And we were supposed to report
to this hotel in Dayton, Ohio.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:90%
We all went there.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And we were, at that
point, told that we

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
were going to be releasing some
information to a production

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
company that was going
to make a UFO movie.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, well,
we can't do that.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.995 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, no, I'm
not going to participate.

00:23:54.995 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:90%
It was all volunteer.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.402 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But they made a
documentary about UFOs.

00:24:01.402 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, all right.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And that was it.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And only a couple people
were even involved in that.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:90%
So we left.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.357 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:24:09.357 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Now, why
were the higher-ups,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, this
committee want you guys

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to engage with a production
company making a UFO

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%
documentary?

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Was it to disinform the public?

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I have no idea.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I didn't participate.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Many of us in the
group decided we

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:90%
weren't going to go on camera.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't going to
talk about what we knew.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.903 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think anybody within
the group even spoke about it.

00:24:37.903 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The only person that
cooperated with the group

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:90%
was Robert Collins.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And Bill Moore was on the show.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Jaime Shandera was on the show.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:84%
They were the actual
ones that started this.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But nobody from the
group, except for Collins,

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:90%
was on the show.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I left the next morning.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I flew back and I didn't have
anything more to do with it.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
their intent was.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.807 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was disinformation.

00:25:01.807 --> 00:25:02.607 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:02.607 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:90%
In 1991, we were reactivated.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot of
different members of the group.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Kit Green was still there.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.362 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Puthoff-- Hal
Puthoff was there.

00:25:13.362 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Why do you think these
people were included, Rick?

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, what do they have
to offer the team that

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:90%
already wasn't there?

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They just were
replacements for the ones that

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:90%
dropped out or weren't there.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:90%
They were scientists.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
All of them were scientists
in some fashion, physicists

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.583 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of scientist.

00:25:30.583 --> 00:25:32.417 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Seems like
they were also connected

00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:90%
to other organizations.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: All of them
were government.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:84%
All of them were
actually government.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Dan Smith wasn't there anymore.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.153 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any
civilians in there.

00:25:40.153 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in there worked
for DARPA or somebody,

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
a government, CIA, or
something like that.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:90%
And we met.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And the object was the
same as it was before.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was no longer
in government service.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:90%
So they wanted us--

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:84%
number one, they wanted
all of our knowledge.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.920 align:middle line:84%
We need your knowledge about
what the government has done.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
people questioning that.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Like, why would you want that?

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The government already
knows what they're doing.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Why would we have to tell you
what the government already

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:90%
knows?

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean, you reopen
this organization now.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Now who's in charge?

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And who's requesting the
information from you?

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:10%
We asked Dr. Sullivan
who was the leader--

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:10%
we asked her-- the
first question was,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm no longer in government.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I signed a
security oath four years ago,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:90%
five years ago.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't disclose this stuff.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, you can.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you how.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you why.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And we ask her
again, is this being

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:55.802 align:middle line:84%
sanctioned by the CIA, ADI,
or military intel, who?

00:26:55.802 --> 00:26:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Good question.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And she said, it's
being sanctioned I said--

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and then we were confused
by who was being sanctioned.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
She said, listen, I'm going
to have somebody here tomorrow

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.930 align:middle line:90%
that will clear this all up.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So we left and went
to the hotel room.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:84%
A bunch of us got together
had a couple of beers.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.233 align:middle line:90%
We talked about it.

00:27:16.233 --> 00:27:18.525 align:middle line:84%
You know, Kit's saying, yeah,
this sounds kind of fishy

00:27:18.525 --> 00:27:18.815 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sounds kind of sketchy.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.162 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: This was during
the Bush administration--

00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Bush one administration.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's like, yeah,
exactly, who in that

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
category and clearance could
actually give you authorization

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to break your oath?

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm asking you.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Who's high enough to do that?

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Only the Director
of Central Intelligence

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
or the Secretary of the Air
Force could tell me to do it.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the only one
would be the section head

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:90%
of each agency.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:90%
And Kit had left the CIA.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Puthoff was still kind
of involved the DARPA,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:90%
but I don't really know--

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: So who would be his?

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, who would give
him the authorization?

00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I don't know.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Because each person--

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, where I
come from, you have

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.303 align:middle line:84%
to report to who you
did the oath with.

00:28:05.303 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You know what I mean?

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So where would these
other members--

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, they all
had different leaders

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:84%
that they would have
to get permission from.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.372 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying
that, oh, one person

00:28:16.372 --> 00:28:18.663 align:middle line:84%
is coming tomorrow that's
going straighten all this out

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:19.660 align:middle line:90%
with everyone.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So I can't wait to hear
who was this one person.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.795 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we
were thinking it

00:28:23.795 --> 00:28:27.988 align:middle line:84%
had to be President Bush or
maybe the Secretary of Defense.

00:28:27.988 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Secretary
of Defense, right?

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Gates, I think
it was at that time.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, the next day we showed up.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:10%
And the only person that was
there was Stansfield Turner.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, he-- CIA under the
Carter administration.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And he shows up.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, he doesn't
have any authority.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't tell us that.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:90%
All he talks about--

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and if you ever heard him
speak, he speaks philosophically

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:90%
about different things--

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:84%
about what's the right thing
to do about getting this out.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first evidence
of this group's existence

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:84%
since 1980 that the word
disclosure was mentioned.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And what they wanted--

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
this was to protect

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Bush because he was
running against Clinton,

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.942 align:middle line:84%
or something sensational
that might have saved him,

00:29:23.942 --> 00:29:24.900 align:middle line:90%
because this is right--

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And this is what year?

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: '91.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: '91-- how coincidental.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, so we thought,
I don't want to get involved.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do it.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:84%
He didn't tell us anything
other than this is why.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to get some
disclosure out there.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So when Sullivan saw
your reaction and everyone's

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:84%
reaction, how did
she respond to this?

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Like, hold on.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't get up and leave just yet.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Look at door number two.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And she
basically said that.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.648 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know there's ways
to get around your security

00:29:55.648 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:90%
oath.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was naive
enough to say, no,

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go to
Leavenworth for 25 years

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
because of you telling
me there's ways around it

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.400 align:middle line:90%
or don't worry about it.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not going to do that.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to operate
within the system.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.948 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll go on
to get another job.

00:30:12.948 --> 00:30:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work for Dr.
Puthoff in a few years.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we kindly, I
think it was unanimously,

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:90%
maybe there was one person.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:90%
But we all said no.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:90%
And we left.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.658 align:middle line:90%
We were paid for this.

00:30:29.658 --> 00:30:31.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you're
going to get a check.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
a check in the mail.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a check in the mail.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, we did.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.243 align:middle line:90%
We each got a check.

00:30:35.243 --> 00:30:37.340 align:middle line:90%
I got $500 for that.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.490 align:middle line:84%
It was three or four days,
plus all expenses were paid.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who paid it.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Was it DI-- I'm sure it was DIA.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But why did DIA go
around the curve.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You know what, all DIA
had to say was, hey,

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:90%
we're going to sanction this.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to throw away
that security pledge, or maybe

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.760 align:middle line:84%
modify or something,
allowing you--

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I would have to
have it in paper.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.977 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how that was
the last meeting in '91.

00:31:07.977 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Wow, how bizarre.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And there was
books written about Aviary

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and then he claiming
to be Falcon.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.917 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't true.

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So where
is the Aviary today?

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Has it been discontinued,
closed down?

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Totally closed down.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And if there is one,
I'm not a member of it.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Do you think
another group emerged

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and that took over that group?

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That's a
good possibility

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that some other entity
within the government

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.290 align:middle line:90%
created another group.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But none of the old
members are on it, I know.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.770 align:middle line:90%
I know the old members.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the people died.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
People are still
around would have

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:84%
disavowed any knowledge
or any connection

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:90%
with any future Aviary group.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, before we wrap
up, can you explain

00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to the viewers what
counterintelligence work is

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.840 align:middle line:90%
actually like?

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Counterintelligence
is the protection

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:90%
of secret operations.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It involves communication
security, physical security.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And counterintelligence
as how we did it,

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:84%
we were presented with
an operation such as--

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:84%
we'll just take, for
example, the F-117 program.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And we had to
protect that program.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
We protect it from being
from espionage, sabotage,

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.300 align:middle line:90%
subversion, and disclosure.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:90%
So how did we do that?

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.790 align:middle line:84%
We did that by
disinforming the people.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:84%
If an F-117 was spotted
over Henderson, Nevada,

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.540 align:middle line:84%
just for an example, and
people started reporting it,

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.660 align:middle line:84%
we'd put out that, hey,
that was a UFO and not

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.250 align:middle line:90%
some government classification.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What's
that black triangle?

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, and so that
would throw the public off

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:84%
on a tangent of a secret
Air Force fighter to a UFO.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they're more
interested in the UFO

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:90%
than they are that.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Of course, right.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so and that
was just an example of how

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:90%
counterintelligence works.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:84%
We didn't call it
disinformation.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We called it
counterintelligence operations.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Now, how can our
viewers trust this information.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I have no
reason, now, today,

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to make up or disinform people
about what I did during my time

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
in the
counterintelligence arena.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling the truth.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get
disclosure out.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.490 align:middle line:84%
The only people that are trying
to destroy my credibility

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.530 align:middle line:84%
are people that wrote UFO
books who don't really

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:90%
know the facts.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.262 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Never been
in the government,

00:33:48.262 --> 00:33:51.460 align:middle line:84%
never worked in the military,
never had a security clearance,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.660 align:middle line:90%
but they wrote a book.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And their book's better
than what I'm trying

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:90%
to say the truth out here.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.612 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I believe
you're an honorable man.

00:33:58.612 --> 00:34:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely
believe you, Rick.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And we share a lot of
the same information.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And I can definitely
validate that for sure.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, Rick, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.540 align:middle line:90%
It's been so much fun.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.258 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Thank you
for having me, Emery.

00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I'm Emery Smith.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.050 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.539 align:middle line:90%
