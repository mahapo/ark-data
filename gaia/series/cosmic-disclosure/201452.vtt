00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:10%
we are with Robert Wood, retired
aerospace engineer who has

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:10%
worked on everything ballistic
missile defense to the space

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.210 align:middle line:10%
station.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:10%
But more recently,
Bob is the editor

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
of a new book on William
Tompkins called "Selected

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:10%
by Extraterrestrials Volume
2, My Life in the Top

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:10%
Secret World of UFOs, Think
Tanks and Nordic Secretaries."

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.207 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to the show.

00:00:42.207 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> ROBERT WOOD: Thank you.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, Tompkins was
part of a high security access

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
group of people related to the
advanced technologies and even

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial beings
interacting with various humans

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and military and governmental
factions on Earth.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, Bill's
involvement in top secret

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:84%
material actually began when he
was just a new guy in the Navy.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But after he left the
Navy, he got a job working

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:90%
for Douglas Aircraft Company.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they realized he
had this top secret clearance

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.230 align:middle line:84%
from the past, they put
him in this top secret

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:84%
think tank where it was
clear that their goal was

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:90%
to study the UFO subject.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.885 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I know these think
tanks include a lot of people.

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:10%
It's not just like a
couple of people there.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Up to like 200
people I've heard.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: Right.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
He says that there were that
many people in that think tank.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
The people that
he was working for

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
are critical in this
context of the book,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
because I knew two of the
people he was working for.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:10%
One of them was
Elmer Wheaton, who

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:10%
was the vice president of the
missiles part at that time.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:10%
And I later worked for him.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:10%
And the other one was
Wolfgang B. Klemperer.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:10%
They called him Klemp.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly
enough, Klemperer

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:10%
was the guy who
was my boss's boss

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:10%
when I got my first job
as a summer hire in 1949.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:90%
And I wondered-- he had a desk.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So you had to go past
his desk in order

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to get this classified
area so he saw

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:90%
everybody who came and went.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%
But he was never there.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Every time I left to get
coffee he was not there.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, you know,
why is he not there.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized when
Bill Tompkins told me

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that he was working for
Klemperer in a vault

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:90%
that that's where he was.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.865 align:middle line:90%
He was in this think tank.

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We have some
interviews done with William

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Tompkins.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:90%
This one is a clip about MJ-12.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.373 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look.

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM TOMPKINS: He's
the secretary of the Navy.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:90%
He's sort of the top guy.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And unlike many military
organization around the planet,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:90%
everybody liked Forrestal.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:90%
All of the people did.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.880 align:middle line:90%
He was really a beautiful guy.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And he knew what he
was talking about.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But his people were
essentially like a short name,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:90%
a name that was abbreviated.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it had quite a few
different titles to it.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:84%
That group were essentially
the apex of the alumni.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So at Douglas, we
had the situation

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
where we're putting together
packages on different areas

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that we were working
on in the think tank.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Now other people
in the tank were

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
aware of who Forrestal was.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were aware
that we should not

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:90%
be using his group's name.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, every
document that we came up

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
with inside that
secret think tank--

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
how will this be
accepted by that group?

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Are we deviating
from their agenda?

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:90%
What is their agenda?

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Who are all of these people?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Is the Bilderberg
involved in this?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Are other organizations,
secret organizations--

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
are they involved in this?

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:84%
We then structured our
presentations to them

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
when he came out to assume
Forrestal was the number one

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
person in the country who
ran the proper organization,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
the real organization
to handle technically

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrial.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We have now what essentially
is the US Navy space

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
systems, which is
not an organization

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's inside of the
secret think tank at Douglas.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
That operation was controlling
everything in the country.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the president of the
United States was not included.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Top military people,
congressmen, were not included.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So here we are
giving away the store

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to the people that are
causing the problem.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
hard for us to accept.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:90%
But this is what was going on.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know it, but
that's what appeared to be.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:10%
In documents that I put together
and several of the others

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:10%
that were submitted
back to the Navy,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:10%
I would make comments
on essentially who

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:10%
does this information go to.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
This was a continuous problem
in a secret think tank.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Klemperer is a real nice
guy, smart and brilliant.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And you can kid with him.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:90%
He's my boss.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Klemperer was
convinced that there

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:90%
were two different groups.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
There was the standard
organizations,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
the Navy's levels
of information.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you got this
other group up on top.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the admiral was
heading that group up on top.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:90%
He was the head of it.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So we assumed after
he was assassinated

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
that that was then true, because
he then was talking too much.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
These are the complexities
of the program

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
where we're off by ourselves
not being influenced by anybody.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
We're coming up
with what we think

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to do to
solve a unbelievable problem.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't
know who your boss is,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%
you do the best you can.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I mean shocking.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about Majestic 12.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Was it just he was
talking too much

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and the Majestic 12 group
said, hey, he's gotta go?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: My opinion with
respect to how and why he was

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:90%
assassinated is twofold.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Number one, because
I had a source,

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I was actually the
recipient of the memo

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that was showed there that his
assassination is regrettable.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Those were the words that they--

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that that
happened, in my opinion,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:90%
was not MJ-12.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It was the CIA before
the MJ-12 was involved.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't want to let the
American public realize that we

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:90%
did not really beat the Nazis.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was going
to tell him that.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Forrestal
was going to tell them

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
the whole story about
the UFOs, and Admiral

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Byrd, and everything else.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And the guys didn't
want to do that.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
The point though that I'd
like to make, especially

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
Bill's involvement,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is that he was
working for the Navy.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy recovered
one of the craft in 1942

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:90%
at the Battle of LA.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And that was sent, in my
judgment, to Point Mugu.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy was
ahead of everybody

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:84%
else in reverse
engineering the craft.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And so MJ-12 was kind
of the CIA and the Army

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.566 align:middle line:90%
and the Air Force's program.

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
about the Navy program.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in my opinion,
it's only in the last decade

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
or so that MJ-12
has realized there

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
was another Navy program going
on that they didn't know about.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.577 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about-- they
said inside there--

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Bill was just talking
about there's--

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:84%
part of Majestic
12 was specifically

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
for reverse engineering and also
studying the extraterrestrials.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you know who was
involved with that?

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, the MJ-12 members,
as they were defined in 1947,

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:90%
were shown.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's no mystery or
secret about their existence.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:84%
The scope of the work
of MJ-12, however, you

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
can discuss that
in my judgment and

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I think in Bill's judgment, too.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.575 align:middle line:84%
The MJ-12 people
were basically trying

00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
to understand
everything that had

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
to do with the alien
crashes and their saucers.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- it
might have included

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.022 align:middle line:84%
part of the process of
reverse engineering them.

00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
reverse engineering

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
processes that the
Navy and MJ-12 had

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
were a little separate.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think that the reverse
engineering portion and just

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
understanding where
these craft come from

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you said not
knowing where they came from.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Tompkins had people
around him that he claimed

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:90%
were Nordics.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, according to Bill.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who were these Nordics?

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, where'd they come from?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what did
he say about them?

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, Bill made a big
deal about the secretaries

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:90%
that he had that were Nordic.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But when he was
working at TRW later,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
he said that he also met
a couple of Nordic males.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:90%
He didn't talk much about them.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear to
me that the Nordics

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
had a plan to help Bill succeed
in whatever he was doing.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:84%
They initially
involved supporting him

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:90%
for the Apollo program.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But when he went
to TRW, it seemed

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:84%
like the Nordics wanted to
continue to keep him, be

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.793 align:middle line:90%
a successful person.

00:10:29.793 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Bill and I did not
speculate about that.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why were we still
using fossil fuels back then?

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
If we were getting
help from the Nordics,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
why was that not
implemented at some point

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
or an exchange of information?

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, my answer
to a question like that

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
would be that NASA was
the official organization,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.700 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be doing
the space exploration.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And they had
immediately concluded

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that the public image of NASA
would be open, scientific,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:90%
nothing classified.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But the private
plan, which I think

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:84%
was much more sophisticated
than most people realized,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
was to have a covert
program available

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:90%
underneath this public plan.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think that
NASA or Majestic 12 ever

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.996 align:middle line:84%
had any infiltration
by the Nordics?

00:11:27.996 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Emery, that's
an interesting question.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
That's something that Bill
and I have never talked about.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.268 align:middle line:90%
But I would speculate that the--

00:11:36.268 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I would think
there'd be some influence.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --answer
is, yeah, likely.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
The MJ-12 people genuinely
wanted to figure out

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And then as it
developed, they decided

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:90%
everything was political.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they
decided they did not

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
want to make any of
this stuff public.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:90%
They were learning stuff.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And, well, furthermore, they
had a logical, actually,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:90%
reason for that.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is we were, in effect,
moving towards the Cold War.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And to tell everything about
how to build anti-gravity craft

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
would not be helpful if the
Russians were going to do it,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, let's take a
look at this video from Bill.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I could never get my
secretary to admit that she was

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:90%
a Nordic, OK?

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knew it,
but she wouldn't accept.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
But from what she would
drop into conversations,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
essentially she was a
part of the Nordic navy,

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:84%
like a commander in
intelligence with a mission

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
to support a specific
program, the Apollo program,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and support all of it, not just
first phase to go to the moon,

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:84%
but second phase to
build navy stations

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
on all of the planets
that were habitable

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
or their moons in
the solar system

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and then build bases on all
of the 12 closest stars.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:90%
That was the Apollo mission.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the two girls in
engineering, the two Nordics,

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
never in any way
of that four years

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
came up with anything that
would bother the mission

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:90%
to be accomplished.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
They were constantly
pushing everybody

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to the side who were trying
to stop the program from being

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
implemented, cover it up,
change information, do it wrong,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
everything, all the way
through the four years.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:90%
So we ended up--

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:90%
we roughly did four years.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I roughly did four
years in the Navy.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I roughly did slightly
less than four years on Apollo.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, part of my four years
on Apollo was on Nova trucks.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:10%
And the Nova trucks were
eight times the size

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:10%
of the Apollo, 10
times the size,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:10%
depending on what you were--

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:10%
and there were trucks to haul
all of the facility equipment

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.370 align:middle line:10%
that we needed to build a
20,000-man Naval Station

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:10%
Research Center on the moon.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:10%
That's what we were
supposed to be doing.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The mission to the moon was
to build these facilities.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And all we did was
get to the moon.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And some guys gave us the finger
and told us don't come back.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, go ahead and finish a couple
of three more year missions

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:90%
and don't come back.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, these were the reptilians.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:90%
So they were already there.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know that.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, we
got stopped a third way

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:90%
through the missions.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, the Nordic people--

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:90%
what are they here for?

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:90%
And who are they?

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't learn
till much later.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
There's boxes full
of Nordics, OK?

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And we got a whole box
full of them, maybe

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:90%
a hundred different types.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And we know now, but back
then, we just thought of one.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
The two young ladies represented
a Nordic civilization.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And my girl turned out to
be a Nordic navy lieutenant

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
commander with a specific
contract and a specific mission

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
to get the Apollo program
implemented, the whole program.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have to say that
that group she supported

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
from out in the galaxy were
the greatest thing that

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:90%
could happen to the planet.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Never did she ever
come up with anything

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that threw cold water on
any part of the program.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
She was always way ahead of
everybody without a fix-it.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And she telepathically,
continually

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:90%
threw stuff in my head--

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
don't let them go
that way, Bill.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:90%
You know what we talked about.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:90%
You got to fix it.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I never
had any type of relationship

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
with a person like her, till
I got over to North American

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:90%
and then over to TRW.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And those girls also refused
to say that they were Nordics.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But they again were doing
exactly the same thing

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
as my secretary at
Douglas on the Apollo.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
They were pushing-- those
girls and two of them

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:90%
at North American.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The one-- I got
into my secretary

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:90%
administrative assistant in TRW.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So there, again,
you're getting support

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
from an individual
that is probably

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
part of the Nordic Navy,
implementing an agenda again.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
They were at war with the
reptilians way out there.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And Solar Warden, of course,
was our portion of that war.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were also at war with
the insects, the praying mantis

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
people, if you want
to call them that.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we were fighting two
of the really bad people.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, we were going to
be fighting with them, which

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:90%
the Nordics were already doing.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Nordics had
lost one massive battle

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
between their planet and
another planet, which

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:84%
the reptilians had
and restructured again

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:90%
and then were back at war again.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about a whole lot

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of things that were elements
in who are the Nordics.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Who are these guys?

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he's mentioned
these Nordic implants working

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
in these compartmentalized
secret programs.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So why do the Nordics
want to help us?

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, he mentioned that
he had two Nordics at Douglas,

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and two at North
American, and then one

00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:84%
at TRW, presumably having the
same goals to keep the Apollo

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:90%
program healthy and going.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, I have never understood
why the Nordics or us,

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, would want
to be limited to a chemical

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
propulsion when we knew how
to do the anti-gravity thing.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if the Nordics
were encouraging our government

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:84%
to continue to
deceive the people.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have that technology.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's confusing.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I don't think
that Bill knew the answer

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to that question.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he didn't think they
had another alternative agenda.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He just--

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.108 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --didn't know.

00:19:45.108 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We never speculated
on alternative Nordic agendas.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:84%
He was always so
emphatic about the way

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
that they helped him do the
right thing for that occasion.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But we never discussed
the long-range plans.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:10%
And when he was at Rocketdyne
after he left Douglas,

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:10%
one of the things that
he was involved in

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:10%
was to create a huge--

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:10%
actually, it was is a document.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
When it was really
printed, it was this big.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't look at
it on the internet.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:90%
You had to actually go print it.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And this document explained
their 20-year plan

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:90%
to explore the universe.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:84%
There were stars
and stuff like that.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And many people
who saw this page

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:84%
thought, wow, this
is a great revelation

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:90%
that we had a long-range plan.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But you look at this plan
and there is no discussion

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:90%
of anti-gravity devices.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:84%
They were using Novas,
which were basically just

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:90%
huge rockets.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've never
figured out why Bill

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
was so excited
about this plan that

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.883 align:middle line:90%
didn't discuss anti-gravity.

00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it
should have been

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:90%
written all over it, right?

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's the only
way to get around.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:10%
Did he mention, other than the
Nordics, of any other ET races

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:10%
that he basically
worked with physically?

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.515 align:middle line:84%
Bill never gave
me the impression

00:21:08.515 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that he actually, physically
worked with any other races.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:84%
He did talk regularly about the
reptilians, about the Greys,

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
about the Nordics, and
about the insect species.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Those were the only four that
he regularly talked about.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But he did emphasize
a number of times

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that there were many
different races.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
He said there was 80 or 120
that he was debriefed on.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And he even
said in this last video

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
that there was 60 different
Nordic species, which

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:90%
really puzzled me.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Because he never said
anything that I heard or saw

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that related to the
differences between species

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.545 align:middle line:90%
within the Nordic.

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:54.345 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:54.345 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Because even our human species--

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:84%
there's many different types
of humans here on the planet.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's very similar, I would
think, with the Nordics,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
with the different types of
races within the species.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: True.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:90%
We have what?

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Five or six Homo
sapiens we know of.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So why did Bill, while working
with Nordics, get abducted?

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.351 align:middle line:84%
Is this before or after
he worked with them?

00:22:25.351 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, Bill had
one abduction experience

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:90%
he put in his book.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was well after he
was working with Nordics.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:90%
It was in the 1980s, I believe.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was with his family,
driving down a road.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And he had missing time.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:90%
And that was really it.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's take a look
at this video from William.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people have
been abducted for years.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are
still being abducted.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But we're into a situation
where, what do we do now?

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:90%
How do we fix this?

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
What are all the things
we have to do to fix it?

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:84%
There are ancient
extraterrestrial facility

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:84%
people, if you want
to call them that,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:84%
who have been living
underground in massive caverns

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
The Earth itself is
almost a honeycomb.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
It has millions of
massive caverns.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We look at the little
caverns that they

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.708 align:middle line:90%
have over in New Mexico.

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And everybody goes there.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And they look at the cavern.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
They've looked at the
inch of a guy's office.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:90%
That's all they looked at.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
When we were talking
caverns Earth wise,

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
one of the caverns in
Southern California

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:90%
goes way past into Oregon.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And it goes east into Nevada.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's one cavern.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's caverns
inside that cavern.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:84%
There's caverns
inside of caverns.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Not just tunnels, but
there's bubble caverns

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:90%
inside of caverns.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And some caverns are only
a couple of miles long,

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
but we are honeycombed.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And so these
extraterrestrials came here,

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:84%
some of them before
Noah built the raft.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And some of them came
after he built the raft,

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.570 align:middle line:90%
after the flood.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But then there's been
seven flood kinds of things

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:90%
that have happened here.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:90%
We forget about that.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:84%
My uncle Walter had
specifics of seven times

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:90%
when they took place.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:84%
One was a situation
where we had earthquakes

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:84%
on a continuous basis from
Alaska to the South Pole,

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Split the thing wide open.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that caused
all kinds of floods.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, we have
extraterrestrials here

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:29.960 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that are not
just living in caverns.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:90%
They have cities there.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:90%
They have industry there.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:90%
They have entertainment there.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
They have essentially--
maybe not like us,

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
but they have essentially
a full life there.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
They're born, they work, and
they step out of the picture.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have ridiculous
short lives like humans.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Others have in betweens,
living 2 or 3,000.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Others don't stop
living, period.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And these people live together
in the different caverns,

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
but obviously, with
totally different agendas,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:84%
totally different lives,
and different missions.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Air Force
got involved in this.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they built their diggers,
which are about half a mile

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And they'll dig a hole.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It'll be 100 foot in diameter.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And we have trains
throughout the United States,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
all over the country, even
connecting to Nova Scotia,

00:26:53.530 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and some of them connecting
to other countries

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
locally in this
particular hemisphere.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But the extraterrestrial
tunnels are

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
300 feet and close to 400 feet.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And these tunnels--
the tunnel diggers

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
dig at two to three
miles an hour.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And they reduce all of the
rock, all of the material,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
everything, down to
microscopic material.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And they spray it on the lining
of the tunnel, which then turns

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to be almost glass, which
then is electrically excited

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and becomes a lighted tunnel.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And these guys are running
there two miles an hour,

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
operating this
tunnel, which then

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
has subsonic vehicles operating
on rail that don't leave

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:84%
the rail, all over the
planet, not just in ours

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:84%
from Washington, DC and the
Pentagon to the Air Force

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:90%
facilities at Vandenberg.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we've run into
their tunnels digging ours.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And we get, not too
graciously, suggested

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:90%
to take another route.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And like in New Mexico, we
have a large facility there.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And we've had wars with some
of the extraterrestrials that

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
are there and worked
with our military people

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and light skirmishes
continually.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But then our people that are
taken from their university

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:07.720 align:middle line:90%
laboratory to that facility--

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:90%
they get taken pretty fast.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:90%
In one second, they're there.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And they take them inside.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And they let them continue
that particular research

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that they were doing
at the university,

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.755 align:middle line:84%
except that now,
they are a slave.

00:29:24.755 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They're not a
business associate.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:90%
They are a slave.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So now, we got slavery
going in these caverns, all

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:90%
over your planet.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But then that's not
such a big deal.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Because out in the galaxy, the
different extraterrestrials--

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:90%
they do the same thing.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:90%
And they take the good guys.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And they abduct them, take
them to their facilities

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:90%
on their planet.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Or they take them
down underground

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:90%
of their original planet.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And they do the same thing.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So again, we don't have
just Earth as a laboratory.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We have billions of laboratories
on billions of stars

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
out in the galaxy
doing the same thing.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We're really low on the
totem pole, unfortunately.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: The geological seismic
survey crew has found large

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:10%
structures-- and this has
been posted in the news--

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:10%
deep within the Earth,
which is very fascinating.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.987 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
this for four years now

00:30:47.987 --> 00:30:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and actually mentioned it
on a couple of episodes.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting to see Bill,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
basically saying, hey, there are
these huge civilizations down

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.090 align:middle line:84%
there where these
beings are working.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
They're living a
full life down there

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:90%
without coming to the surface.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever mention to you what
type of beings were down there?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, Emery, the
extensive underground

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.505 align:middle line:84%
civilizations is one
of the biggest secrets

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:18.270 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from
listening to Bill.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:84%
He would be talking about the
transportation systems, mostly.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But the video we just saw
talked about the civilizations

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.030 align:middle line:90%
that were living there.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.220 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that he was
never very specific about was,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:90%
what did they look like?

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Which group was it?

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, he talked
about the Greys, the insects,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
the reptilians, and the Nordics.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But he would-- never
specific about saying

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:90%
it was one of those four kinds.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:84%
He implied that one of
them was a different kind.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
For example, my
recollection is that he

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:58.050 align:middle line:84%
stated that the reptilians,
with whom the Nazis signed

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:84%
an agreement for the
Antarctic, was just

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
one of the races of
reptilians who also lived

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:09.010 align:middle line:84%
in caverns in
Siberia underground,

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and that they had some
relationship with each other.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So there is an example that
I remember specifically

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
where he did talk about
underground civilization, two

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:90%
separate ones.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the
projects I have heard

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:84%
about these
underground facilities,

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.540 align:middle line:84%
not only that we are
in control of, but also

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial facilities.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:84%
He did mention that a couple
times they dug through

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.890 align:middle line:90%
into another tunnel.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, did he mean that
was an extraterrestrial-made

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.450 align:middle line:90%
tunnel that's been there for--

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --thousands of years?

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
that we had built?

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.932 align:middle line:84%
He stated that we were
digging our own tunnels.

00:32:49.932 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And he showed some
of the equipment

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:55.043 align:middle line:84%
that we used or used to
use to dig those tunnels,

00:32:55.043 --> 00:32:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and that once in
a while, we'd run

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
into an extraterrestrial
cavern or civilization.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Right after I got
my PhD in 1953,

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I was regularly reading the
"Scientific American" articles,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
which Philip Morrison,
who was my professor,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:90%
was actually an editor of.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the articles I
remember reading at that time

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
was a discussion of
how easy it would

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:84%
be to take a large
boring machine

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and drill from one
coast to the other,

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.510 align:middle line:84%
evacuate it, put in
rails, and make trains.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, this was 1954.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So then that was the last time
that subject ever appeared

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.810 align:middle line:90%
in the public literature.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And in my judgment, that's
when the entire process

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
of underground
digging went black.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:90%
