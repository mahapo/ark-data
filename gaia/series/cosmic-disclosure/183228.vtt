we are with Randy Cramer who
claims to have participated

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.884 align:middle line:10%
in a secret space program for 20
years called the Earth Defense

Randy lived on the planet
Mars for 17 years where

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.851 align:middle line:84%
he said there were approximately
six to seven million people

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.228 align:middle line:84%
living, including
various ET races.

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.729 align:middle line:90%

>> EMERY: Randy for those
people that don't know you,

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
let's give a brief history about
what you did in the military

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.779 align:middle line:90%
space program.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:53.196 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.115 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm a captain
United States Marine Corps

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.743 align:middle line:10%
Special Section, which is the
covert military space program

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:01.079 align:middle line:10%
arm of the Marine Corps, which
was formed in about the 1954

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.789 align:middle line:10%
time frame by
President Dwight D.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower as a response
to lack of cooperation

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.086 align:middle line:84%
that he was getting from
the MJ-12 committee.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So in the late 1960s, they were
developing a augmented soldier

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.472 align:middle line:84%
program to build soldiers
genetically from the ground up,

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:22.934 align:middle line:84%
which I was in a program in the
late 1960s called Project Moon

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:23.769 align:middle line:90%
Shadow.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.855 align:middle line:84%
So I was genetically
engineered from the ground up,

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
tinkered with some
extraterrestrial hybridized DNA

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.196 align:middle line:84%
to be smarter, faster, stronger
for soldiering abilities,

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:38.116 align:middle line:84%
was trained as a toddler through
adolescence, teenage years,

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:41.536 align:middle line:84%
deployed when I was 17 years
old for a 20-year tour of duty

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.414 align:middle line:84%
where I spent a little
over 17 years in the MDF,

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.999 align:middle line:84%
which is the Mars
Defense Force, which

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.668 align:middle line:84%
is a contracting agency that
works for the Mars Colony

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:52.631 align:middle line:84%
Corporation, which is under
the umbrella of the ICC,

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
or the International
Corporate Conglomerate.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.345 align:middle line:84%
I was in the infantry
there on the ground mostly

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.014 align:middle line:84%
scuffling with indigenous
reptoids and indigenous

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.642 align:middle line:84%
insectoids territorially,
mostly really

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:05.727 align:middle line:90%
to test military equipment.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.979 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
end of that period,

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.107 align:middle line:84%
I was given a promotion,
got to go to flight school

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and finished out my 20-year
tour as a pilot in an air wing

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
aboard the EDF SS
Nautilus, which

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.864 align:middle line:84%
stands for Earth Defense
Force Starship Nautilus, which

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.534 align:middle line:84%
basically an aircraft
carrier in space

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.495 align:middle line:84%
patrolling the solar system
to keep interlopers out.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.123 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what was the first
time you actually got involved

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:28.291 align:middle line:84%
with the covert
military space program,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.501 align:middle line:90%
and why did they pick you?

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.087 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, like I said, I
was engineered from the ground

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:32.879 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.715 align:middle line:84%
So my whole purpose from the
time before I was even born

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.841 align:middle line:90%
was to do this job.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:40.846 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually a special
section marine from the time

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:41.847 align:middle line:90%
that I was a baby.

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:46.143 align:middle line:84%
So I was really in the force
from the time that I was born.

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:48.687 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, it
was about 17 years old

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.647 align:middle line:84%
that I was deployed
for my tour of duty.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.399 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did your
parents know about this?

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.692 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Not at the time.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.944 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting process
the way that they do this.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle line:84%
Typically, you're
taken for a training

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.032 align:middle line:84%
exercise in the
middle of the night,

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.909 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized
for some people

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.537 align:middle line:84%
this may sound even more
outlandish than some

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.414 align:middle line:84%
of the rest of this
does, but they actually--

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
you may go away for a number
of hours or even days,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.169 align:middle line:84%
and then they return
you 15 minutes

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.713 align:middle line:84%
after you left by
using time travel.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.673 align:middle line:84%
So it appears to
your family members

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.923 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that you've
never been anywhere.

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:18.675 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That
you've never gone.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.136 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: And then, personally,
I would wake up the next

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:24.264 align:middle line:84%
morning and just think, wow,
what a weird dream that was

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that lasted for so long, and
just presume from where I was

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.062 align:middle line:84%
standing that, oh, that was
just a really weird dream.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.065 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, even I
wasn't complete--

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.819 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would remember
things, but it was in a context,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.405 align:middle line:84%
again, that I would just go,
oh, I had a really weird dream.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.574 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, before
we go any further,

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.034 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the exciting
day you had yesterday.

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:47.245 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I have been
itching for someone to give me

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.331 align:middle line:90%
a polygraph for years.

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.457 align:middle line:84%
People have asked me
before, have you gotten one?

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.877 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, as soon as I can
find someone to give me one.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.379 align:middle line:84%
So I was excited when they
offered to give me one.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.299 align:middle line:84%
And, look, if you're
not afraid of the truth

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.967 align:middle line:84%
and you're not afraid
to be scrutinized,

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.177 align:middle line:90%
why be afraid of a polygraph?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:02.969 align:middle line:90%
So I was--

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:03.053 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.095 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I was
excited about it.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.014 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad we finally
got that underway.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.807 align:middle line:84%
And it was
administered by someone

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.435 align:middle line:84%
who has decades of experience
and has administered

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.479 align:middle line:90%
over 20,000 polygraph exam.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.775 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think it
was an excellent day.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.777 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's
take a look at that.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BRIAN HOFF: My
name is Brian Hoff.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.782 align:middle line:90%
I'm a polygraph examiner.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:24.991 align:middle line:90%
So Randy, go ahead and relax.

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:84%
All right, so Randy,
go ahead and relax.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.374 align:middle line:90%
Remain still.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.582 align:middle line:90%
We'll begin in just a moment.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.089 align:middle line:90%
And the test is beginning.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.884 align:middle line:90%
Are you now in Colorado?

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:43.718 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:50.392 align:middle line:84%
>> HOFF: Are you currently a
ranking member of the USMC SS?

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.561 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.104 align:middle line:84%
>> HOFF: During your
entire lifetime,

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
have you ever violated
any rules or regulations?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: No.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.362 align:middle line:84%
>> HOFF: Regarding your
involvement in the USMC SS,

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.407 align:middle line:84%
do you intend to answer each
of my questions truthfully?

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.284 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:10.287 align:middle line:84%
>> HOFF: Have you ever killed
an extraterrestrial being?

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.956 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.375 align:middle line:84%
>> HOFF: Have you ever said
anything out of anger that you

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.751 align:middle line:90%
later regretted?

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.962 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: No.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.089 align:middle line:84%
>> HOFF: Have you ever
physically been to a planet

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.132 align:middle line:90%
other than Earth?

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.676 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.137 align:middle line:84%
>> HOFF: Have you ever been
deployed on a 20 and back

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:27.929 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:28.722 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.225 align:middle line:90%
>> HOFF: The test is ending.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.018 align:middle line:90%
Remain still.

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:41.067 align:middle line:84%
So based on Mr. Cramer's
polygraph examination results,

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.279 align:middle line:84%
there are no indications
that Mr. Cramer was actively

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.741 align:middle line:84%
attempting to deceive me or
the polygraph examination.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.202 align:middle line:84%
If you'll look right here these,
two green spots right here

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.871 align:middle line:84%
and right here,
those are where I

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.332 align:middle line:84%
asked him to lie to
me directly and where

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.168 align:middle line:84%
I knew that what he
had said was a lie.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.586 align:middle line:84%
These little red
parts right here,

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.212 align:middle line:84%
this one and this
one, those are where

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.715 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about being
off world and about

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:07.552 align:middle line:84%
whether or not he had done
a 20 and back program.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.263 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective,
Mr. Cramer does believe

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.807 align:middle line:90%
that he is telling the truth.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.309 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What a
validating moment--

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.976 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:15.602 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --for you.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.854 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've always known
I've been telling the truth,

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.314 align:middle line:84%
but I understand that
not everybody else

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.106 align:middle line:90%
understands that.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.941 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad to have
had the test now.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.486 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: People now are
going to have to look at this,

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to say, yeah,
you could fake a polygraph.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.824 align:middle line:90%
That's very difficult to do.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.534 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think people
who say that don't understand

00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
polygraph exams,
have never taken one,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.957 align:middle line:84%
or tried to understand what
the countermeasures are.

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:41.961 align:middle line:84%
I felt that the explanation
that was given to me by the test

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.173 align:middle line:84%
givers was incredibly detailed
about what information

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.425 align:middle line:84%
that they're reading, how
this is something that's

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.927 align:middle line:90%
not in your conscious brain.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.637 align:middle line:90%
It's not guilt oriented.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:54.224 align:middle line:84%
It's lower cerebellum
amygdala responses,

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.351 align:middle line:90%
capillary expansion--

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sweat glands.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.062 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: --blood
pressure, sweat glands,

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.314 align:middle line:84%
things that you can't
consciously control.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.982 align:middle line:84%
They're part of the
autonomic system.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.151 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, let's talk
about the 20 and Back program.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.195 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of people
out there that understand this.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.989 align:middle line:84%
Let's get in the definition of
that and how you were involved.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:10.782 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:12.867 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, I was
deployed at 17 years

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:14.661 align:middle line:90%
old for a 20-year tour.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.415 align:middle line:90%
So from 17 to 37, did my tour.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:21.376 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
bring personnel

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.545 align:middle line:84%
back to Luna Operations
Command, they

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.588 align:middle line:90%
do what they call a memory wipe.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.548 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a wipe.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.425 align:middle line:90%
It's a suppression of memory.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.635 align:middle line:84%
And they also do something
they call an age reversal,

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
but it's not actually
an age reversal.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.222 align:middle line:84%
They hatch out a
clone body that's

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
the same age when
you left and then

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.227 align:middle line:84%
transfer your entire
consciousness into that clone

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.688 align:middle line:84%
and then stick you back, again,
15 minutes after you left.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.399 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, the
next morning, I

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.403 align:middle line:84%
wake up thinking I had a dream
that was months and months

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
or years long, and it
was just like, well,

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.324 align:middle line:84%
that was really weird,
and then just kind of had

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the recovery
from that point on.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.662 align:middle line:90%
But that's basically it.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.331 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you know the
science, how that works,

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:04.544 align:middle line:84%
the shifting of consciousness
into another living organism?

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.672 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, since I
wasn't awake for the process,

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.258 align:middle line:84%
I can only tell you what I've
been told about the process.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:14.721 align:middle line:90%
My understanding is that our--

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
not to get too metaphysical
because, as I understand,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.727 align:middle line:84%
this is a very scientific
thing that our spirit and/or

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.855 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is a
quantum fluid dynamic.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And being a quantum
fluid dynamic

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
means that it can be removed
and put from vessel to vessel.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.865 align:middle line:84%
So they can take your
consciousness and your spirit

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:84%
being out of your body, put
it into a temporary vessel,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.955 align:middle line:84%
and then put it into another
body or an alien even

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.457 align:middle line:90%
or another species or whatever.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.334 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular
case, my understanding

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.836 align:middle line:84%
is they just put it
into a younger clone

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.546 align:middle line:84%
version of yourself
and then send you

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.632 align:middle line:84%
back so that you don't
think anything happened

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.509 align:middle line:84%
or that no one's
the wiser, anyway.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:56.471 align:middle line:84%
The previous body that I had
basically was on a table.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.932 align:middle line:84%
They had a fresh one
on another table,

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
transferred the
consciousness from one,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.061 align:middle line:84%
and then took my old body and
stuck it in the incinerator.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.189 align:middle line:84%
So it's a permanent
transfer in this case.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.066 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What year
was that, Randy?

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.193 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: That would
have been about 2007.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:13.613 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So I'm
looking at the clone?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.739 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.073 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.032 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: You look great.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:16.908 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Thank you.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:22.247 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Laying in
bed, when you wake up,

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:26.501 align:middle line:84%
when does the switching of the
old body and the clone take

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:30.296 align:middle line:90%
place, or is it already there?

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: So let's try to
start at the beginning here.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.634 align:middle line:90%
So I'm 17 years old.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:39.222 align:middle line:84%
I'm taken away for deployment,
do a 20-year tour of duty.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:44.435 align:middle line:84%
I'm 37 years old, brought back
to Luna Operations Command,

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:47.313 align:middle line:90%
put into another age--

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:51.359 align:middle line:84%
a new clone body that's 17
years old again so that--

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:55.321 align:middle line:84%
and that clone is put in 15
minutes after my original time

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.155 align:middle line:90%
that I left.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:59.075 align:middle line:90%
So there's no body in the bed.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.619 align:middle line:84%
Like, my body is completely
taken out of the bed.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.664 align:middle line:84%
My whole physical person
goes on this tour of duty.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.416 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody there.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
If people want to get
complex about timelines,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.839 align:middle line:84%
there's a timeline in
there somewhere where

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.757 align:middle line:90%
I was gone for 20 years.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:17.427 align:middle line:84%
My parents woke up the
next day and I wasn't there

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.928 align:middle line:90%
and their son had disappeared.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:23.182 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as they bring me
back 15 minutes after I left,

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that erases and
deletes that timeline,

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.479 align:middle line:84%
and then it's as if
that never happened.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.649 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically a
security precaution

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:35.904 align:middle line:84%
to have no physical
evidence, no fingerprint

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.156 align:middle line:84%
sort of left behind
on the process

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:41.576 align:middle line:84%
so that they can return
personnel back into their life

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.704 align:middle line:84%
and not have them
know what happened

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.873 align:middle line:84%
or have any conscious
recollection of it.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:50.335 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What happens when
you're gone for 20 years

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:53.463 align:middle line:84%
and then you come back, I
guess, what, 15 minutes later?

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.423 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle line:84%
Well, like I said, I
woke up the next day.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:01.012 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can remember vividly
waking up the next morning

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.097 align:middle line:84%
and, as I'm sitting
up in my bed,

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:05.391 align:middle line:84%
recalling what seemed
to be a dream that went

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.101 align:middle line:90%
on and on and on and on and on.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:11.105 align:middle line:84%
And your brain wants to
acclimate very quickly to that.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.524 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's so
much shock and trauma

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:16.611 align:middle line:84%
with the tour of duty
that your brain is not

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:20.615 align:middle line:84%
eager to lay claim to
that set of memories.

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It would rather go, oh,
that never happened,

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.828 align:middle line:84%
and then you're just
presumed that you're

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.539 align:middle line:84%
right where you started
even though there's

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:32.877 align:middle line:84%
a lot of residual emotional,
vivid visual memories,

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and not to mention the
trauma, the leftover trauma.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.006 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:37.799 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.759 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Through my
experience, I know working

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:84%
in the classified project,
especially as an active duty

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:46.265 align:middle line:84%
service member, we did have
compartmentalized programs

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.308 align:middle line:90%
for soldiers.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.644 align:middle line:84%
So can we tell the
audience and explain

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:53.106 align:middle line:84%
that-- you'd be good
at this because you

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.234 align:middle line:84%
were in the Marines,
but I am assuming

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.862 align:middle line:84%
you're also part of a
secret part of that Marines

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that probably people don't
understand or know about,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.158 align:middle line:90%
or was it just the Marines?

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Oh, United States
Marine Corps Special Section

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.623 align:middle line:84%
has what I would say a very
loose relationship with what I

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.875 align:middle line:84%
would call the standard
or regular Marine Corps

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:18.047 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that all the
military branches have covert

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
military space program
operations that are loosely

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.972 align:middle line:84%
associated because of the
officer cadre and the way that

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.016 align:middle line:84%
intelligence information
has to be passed around.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.935 align:middle line:84%
But they're definitely
compartmentalized in such a way

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.645 align:middle line:84%
that they're very
separated as well.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:90%
So depending on--

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.191 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can have
an admiral in the Navy

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:39.777 align:middle line:84%
and an admiral in Naval
Space Command that

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:42.905 align:middle line:84%
have two very different levels
of briefing on what's going on.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:45.324 align:middle line:84%
So same thing's true with
the Marine Corps and Special

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:46.117 align:middle line:90%
Section.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:52.623 align:middle line:84%
So definitely the training and
the education that I received

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:55.209 align:middle line:84%
was all very
specifically targeted

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:58.921 align:middle line:84%
to exopolitical situations,
exotic encounters,

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:02.341 align:middle line:84%
exotic locations, and dealing
with extraterrestrial life

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.134 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:06.095 align:middle line:84%
So United States Marine
Corps Special Section, again,

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:10.767 align:middle line:84%
was created by Dwight D.
Eisenhower in 1954 time frame

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.643 align:middle line:84%
really as a separate
branch that was

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:16.522 align:middle line:84%
to be a covert military
space program investigating

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.067 align:middle line:90%
and deployment arm.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.194 align:middle line:84%
So it was going to be
specifically designed

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.697 align:middle line:84%
to take all of this new
information and new technology

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.241 align:middle line:84%
and process it in
such a way that

00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:29.827 align:middle line:90%
would maximize its potential.

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:33.456 align:middle line:84%
But the main difference
there was MJ-12.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle line:84%
While taking the certain
amount of military intelligence

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.212 align:middle line:84%
personnel, there are also a lot
of private industry contractors

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.756 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, which I think was
where a lot of the corruption

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:42.632 align:middle line:90%
came in.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:46.135 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower wanted to create a
military organization in which

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.764 align:middle line:84%
everyone was sworn
to defend and uphold

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.016 align:middle line:84%
the Constitution of the
United States of America

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.768 align:middle line:84%
from all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.062 align:middle line:84%
So he felt that it was going
to be an organization that

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
would have less corruption
issues, would be more

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.902 align:middle line:84%
respectful and concerned
about legal framework

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.113 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were
violating the law or not

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.739 align:middle line:84%
as well as to be a
little bit of a check

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:08.574 align:middle line:84%
and balance to some
of the craziness

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.701 align:middle line:84%
that the MJ-12
committee was doing.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.539 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So would you say
you were an active duty Marine

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:18.876 align:middle line:84%
service member or were
you a covert specialist

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:22.088 align:middle line:90%
in the Marines that was--

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.507 align:middle line:84%
you were not allowed to be
known, if you know what I mean?

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:27.802 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, it's all
kept classified for sure,

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.972 align:middle line:84%
but it was definitely during
my tour of duty was considered

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:31.889 align:middle line:90%
active duty.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.057 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:35.977 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was your rank
and role towards the end there?

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Oh, I made
captain in the end.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.855 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: All right.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: But that is after
clawing my way up to sergeant

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.275 align:middle line:90%
major.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.403 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a Mustang, which
means I started out

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.947 align:middle line:84%
as an enlisted person and
got to get my commission

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.031 align:middle line:90%
and be an officer later.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.284 align:middle line:90%
So I worked my way up.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:54.162 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me about
the Naval Space Command.

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:57.373 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Naval Space Command
essentially is in charge

00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:01.085 align:middle line:84%
of the large ships in the
fleet, so these what we call

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:04.589 align:middle line:84%
Heighliner class, which is
essentially a long cylinder

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:08.759 align:middle line:84%
that's about a mile long,
which is basically a floating

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.678 align:middle line:90%
aircraft carrier in space.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
Naval Space Command

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.476 align:middle line:84%
is the main administrator
of those vehicles

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.686 align:middle line:90%
and those vessels for sure.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.771 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is the Naval
Space Command venturing out

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:21.731 align:middle line:90%
of our solar system?

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:22.982 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh yes, absolutely.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.359 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they
going interdimensional?

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:28.905 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I would suggest that
as the technology permits they

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.198 align:middle line:90%
do, yes.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.533 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, I know there's
a lot going on out there.

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:34.744 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some
amazing photography

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:36.787 align:middle line:84%
with using special
telescopes and stuff

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:37.788 align:middle line:90%
that we have in space.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:38.331 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: For sure.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.249 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And I just was
wondering if you knew

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.251 align:middle line:84%
of or were privy to
that information.

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.587 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: You know, I have
a lot of information that

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:45.546 align:middle line:90%
I'm privy to.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:48.591 align:middle line:84%
But being one person,
I don't get all of it.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.592 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.093 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: And I
always tell people,

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.222 align:middle line:84%
if they bring information to
me, I can always go to my people

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.849 align:middle line:84%
and get an intelligence briefing
if it's something that I

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:57.934 align:middle line:90%
don't know about.

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a number
of experimental vehicles.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.605 align:middle line:84%
We always have to
consider, when we

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:05.441 align:middle line:84%
talk about the space program,
the Neuschwabenlanders

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:08.944 align:middle line:84%
and their program, which is
separate from Naval Space

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Command because they
like to be different.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.078 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
understand, their main ship

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.913 align:middle line:90%
is called a Juggernaut.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And they, again,
tend to be pretty--

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.585 align:middle line:84%
can be a mile, mile
and a half in length,

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:28.422 align:middle line:84%
tend to be very heavily armored
with all of the central command

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:31.634 align:middle line:84%
deep in the middle of
the ship to protect it

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:32.677 align:middle line:90%
from all the layers.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:33.511 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:38.349 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how many
people do these craft hold?

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: It
depends on the size,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:45.273 align:middle line:84%
but a crew can be anywhere
from 3,000 to 4,000 personnel.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.441 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are there
extraterrestrials onboard with

00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:49.318 align:middle line:90%
the humans from Earth?

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:54.365 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Sometimes there are
some consultants and some other

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.325 align:middle line:90%
personnel that I would say--

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.327 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to describe this.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.955 align:middle line:84%
In the same way
that terrestrially

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.999 align:middle line:84%
we have military exchange
programs-- so it's possible,

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:06.919 align:middle line:84%
say, for a Canadian
military officer

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.589 align:middle line:84%
or a British military officer
to participate in an exchange

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.009 align:middle line:84%
program, the US
military programs,

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.552 align:middle line:90%
and we do the same thing.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:18.764 align:middle line:84%
So in that same way, we have
some extraterrestrial personnel

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:22.101 align:middle line:84%
that, again, participate
in this exchange program

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.186 align:middle line:84%
so that we can send
personnel to other worlds

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.564 align:middle line:84%
and participate and learn
from their programs.

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.317 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of
an exchange program

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:32.611 align:middle line:84%
is you're moving people around
with different knowledge

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.363 align:middle line:84%
and different
experience to share that

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.032 align:middle line:84%
with other crew and
other personnel.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.868 align:middle line:84%
So yes, but not
very many I guess

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.161 align:middle line:90%
is the answer to that question.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever
had, later in life,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.917 align:middle line:84%
a total recall of an event
that you totally forgot about?

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:47.877 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:48.169 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I have.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.503 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Let's talk about that.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.132 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: OK.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.509 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I know it can
get a little sensitive.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:56.844 align:middle line:90%
I've been in there before.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:57.762 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure, yeah.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:01.349 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could go a lot of
different directions with that.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:02.141 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not sure--

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.602 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was the most
prominent one that you had that

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:09.065 align:middle line:84%
you were like, oh my gosh,
I just remembered an entire

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:13.319 align:middle line:84%
expedition or mission that I
actually forgot about or they

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.946 align:middle line:84%
mind erased you and then
you had this total recall?

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, what was the
most prominent one

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.158 align:middle line:90%
that was like, wow?

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: So when I was in
the MDF stationed on Mars,

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.625 align:middle line:84%
we did occasionally get pulled
out for an off-world mission,

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:31.879 align:middle line:84%
which would usually be a few
days, maybe a couple of weeks,

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.507 align:middle line:90%
and then we would come back.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But usually there was a
mind wipe or repression

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.179 align:middle line:84%
immediately after for
security purposes,

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:44.558 align:middle line:84%
and there was a time
when, as I was--

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:46.519 align:middle line:84%
I'd sit in meditative
process, go

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.355 align:middle line:84%
into sort of alpha theta states
to dig into the subconscious

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:50.231 align:middle line:90%
to remember things.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:53.025 align:middle line:84%
So I was going through some
memories that were familiar

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.611 align:middle line:84%
that I just wanted to
be more familiar with,

00:19:55.611 --> 00:20:00.491 align:middle line:84%
and I always find, for my own
healing process, the more vivid

00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:04.537 align:middle line:84%
I can recall a memory, the more
vivid the emotional context,

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.163 align:middle line:84%
which then gives
you the opportunity

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:12.044 align:middle line:84%
to heal that emotional sort
of trauma, which just reduces

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.004 align:middle line:84%
the PTSD symptoms
in my experience.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.632 align:middle line:84%
So as I was going through
this memory recall process,

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.885 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden this
whole memory just kind of

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.804 align:middle line:84%
launched right through
my brain of going

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.932 align:middle line:84%
on this off-world mission
and experiencing that.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:27.393 align:middle line:90%
It was basically they were--

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:30.146 align:middle line:84%
on one of the moons of Saturn,
they were building a base,

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:34.358 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing a lot
of subterranean excavation,

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:38.487 align:middle line:84%
and they hit a nest of some
giant spiders or something

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.865 align:middle line:84%
like that, and their security
guys couldn't deal with it,

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:84%
so they wanted to call
in some specialists.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.705 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can see now, from
remembering things like this,

00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:53.252 align:middle line:84%
where like the arachnophobia
and the insectophobia came from,

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
because if you think
you're scared of a spider

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.467 align:middle line:84%
this big, trust me, when there's
a spider a jumping spider

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:02.553 align:middle line:84%
this big, it's kind of
terrifying at first.

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:04.472 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:07.266 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Even when you're
more prepared and you're in body

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:10.686 align:middle line:84%
armor, it's still very shocking
to have a giant spider jump

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:90%
on your face.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.563 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.398 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Yeah,
it leaves a mark.

00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:18.986 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In totality, what
would you say the number

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:23.282 align:middle line:84%
of years that you really are
if you included all the 20

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.074 align:middle line:90%
and Back?

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: If I include
my full tour of duty,

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I include the training
time, I'm well into my 80s.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.169 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you still active
in corporate or military

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:36.003 align:middle line:90%
positions?

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:38.672 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: United States Marine
Corps Special Section considers

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:40.466 align:middle line:84%
me an independent
field commander.

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:43.302 align:middle line:84%
So I have active duty rank
and security clearance,

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.386 align:middle line:90%
but they don't pay me.

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:46.305 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way that
works at the moment.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.808 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what do they call
the security clearances that

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:51.185 align:middle line:90%
you're involved with?

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:54.647 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: My security clearance
is a blue gold 13 for whatever

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:57.608 align:middle line:84%
that means to anybody if they
understand that sort of thing.

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.527 align:middle line:84%
I have been working with
my brigadier general,

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:02.738 align:middle line:84%
and we have been discussing
contracts and some other things

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:05.366 align:middle line:84%
that I get to do to sort of take
care of my independent field

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:06.158 align:middle line:90%
command.

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.868 align:middle line:84%
But I actually have
a greater freedom

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:09.328 align:middle line:84%
to do what I do,
to be here sitting

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.956 align:middle line:84%
talking about this right now as
an independent field commander,

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:14.792 align:middle line:84%
than I would if I were under
the same umbrella of secrecy

00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:17.169 align:middle line:84%
agreements that my brigadier
general of the command staff

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.754 align:middle line:84%
are and they were
giving me a check.

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.756 align:middle line:84%
So being an independent
field commander

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:24.176 align:middle line:84%
is legally why I can sit here
and not be breaking the law.

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:27.471 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What I was going to
ask next is does the general

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:90%
and the suits know--

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.017 align:middle line:84%
obviously they know you're
here, you're doing this.

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:32.518 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh yeah.

00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:34.645 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they come to
your house like they come

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:38.983 align:middle line:84%
into my house and say, you know,
Smith, you can talk about this,

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:42.611 align:middle line:84%
but you better slow it down
when you get over here?

00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:44.488 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, they
don't come to my house.

00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
We do communicate
on a regular basis.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.704 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually asked to do
this job about seven years ago,

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.456 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding
was the command staff

00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:58.544 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have someone to be a
public spokesperson that they

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:01.005 align:middle line:84%
could have a certain amount
of plausible deniability with.

00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:06.218 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to shock
the world in such a way

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.887 align:middle line:84%
that it would really rattle
the cages of everyone,

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.264 align:middle line:84%
but they wanted
someone that they

00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:13.559 align:middle line:84%
could present information
and sort of explain

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.436 align:middle line:84%
the narrative of
what's been going on.

00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:18.147 align:middle line:84%
And there was a short list,
apparently, of officers

00:23:18.147 --> 00:23:22.026 align:middle line:84%
that they whittled down, and
eventually that became me.

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked me
if I wanted to do that.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.032 align:middle line:84%
And after some reluctance,
I agreed, and turned out

00:23:28.032 --> 00:23:30.618 align:middle line:84%
it was going to be better than
doing what I was doing before.

00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:32.494 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I decided, all
right, I'll do this.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.413 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they're very
aware of what I'm doing.

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:37.999 align:middle line:84%
They're very happy
for me to be here.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:41.503 align:middle line:84%
My brigadier has
said that he doesn't

00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
want people to think that
they're telling me what to say,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and so he says, look,
what you say is up to you.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:90%
You get to decide that.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.597 align:middle line:84%
Just understand that
there are certain

00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:56.226 align:middle line:84%
things that may not serve
the purpose to tell people

00:23:56.226 --> 00:24:00.606 align:middle line:84%
and/or may endanger a
active duty service member,

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.191 align:middle line:84%
and those are the
only things I really

00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:03.359 align:middle line:90%
have to concern myself with.

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:07.154 align:middle line:84%
So I do my very best to tell
the truth as I understand

00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
it, the most clear that I
can, and very rarely omit

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.284 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:15.162 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't really tell me
what to say or what not to say.

00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:17.956 align:middle line:84%
But we certainly have come
up against certain subjects

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:20.334 align:middle line:84%
where I've had to say, do you
want me to talk about that,

00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:23.504 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, yeah,
fine, or maybe you should not

00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:26.048 align:middle line:84%
give the whole story
on that, because I

00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:28.175 align:middle line:84%
know it's hard for people
to understand this, but--

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, it's
a safety reason.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:90%
It's safety.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.304 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, some security
is there for a reason,

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:35.349 align:middle line:84%
and mostly it's to protect
active duty personnel.

00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:37.267 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to be
aware that when you're

00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:41.105 align:middle line:84%
telling something that is
under a secrecy umbrella

00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:43.565 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing it in such
a way that's not going to put

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:46.694 align:middle line:84%
anybody in harm's way because
that's where it becomes

00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:50.114 align:middle line:84%
criminal on my part if I put
someone in harm's way, then

00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that's when I get a bad
check on my annual review.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.327 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I
am given full permission

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:57.329 align:middle line:84%
to say what I want, how
I want, when I want,

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:84%
discuss what I want, pick topics
as I want, and, as my brigadier

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.755 align:middle line:84%
said, just be honest,
tell the truth, be clear,

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:07.715 align:middle line:90%
don't embellish.

00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:10.968 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
gild the lily at all.

00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:12.761 align:middle line:84%
Just tell it like
you remember it.

00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:15.305 align:middle line:84%
And whether people want
to accept that or believe

00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:16.974 align:middle line:84%
you or not, it
doesn't matter to you.

00:25:16.974 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
to me honestly.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.186 align:middle line:84%
It's just my job is
to tell the truth

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:22.604 align:middle line:90%
to the best of my ability.

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:23.939 align:middle line:90%
So it's what I do.

00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.316 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do you and
the general communicate,

00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:27.317 align:middle line:90%
through what means?

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I actually have a
micro walkie-talkie in the back

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.699 align:middle line:84%
of my skull, and we also,
Special Section officers,

00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:36.785 align:middle line:84%
have an implant central in
the brain that connects us

00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:38.412 align:middle line:90%
to a psionic computer.

00:25:38.412 --> 00:25:40.831 align:middle line:84%
So we get to experience
a pseudo hive mind,

00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:43.876 align:middle line:84%
and so we are able to just
communicate psionically.

00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:47.379 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are the implants
organic or are they a type

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.547 align:middle line:90%
of synthetic material?

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:50.841 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: My understanding
is they're mostly synthetic

00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:51.759 align:middle line:90%
materials.

00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, it's
not my specialty

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.094 align:middle line:90%
to know much about them.

00:25:54.094 --> 00:25:55.971 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding is
they're predominantly

00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.432 align:middle line:84%
synthetic materials
and/or materials

00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:01.602 align:middle line:84%
that mimic natural
biological materials

00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:04.021 align:middle line:84%
so that your body doesn't
reject them and get inflammation

00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:05.397 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.065 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Have you ever seen--

00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:09.026 align:middle line:84%
have you ever done
an MRI or an x-ray

00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:11.153 align:middle line:84%
where something
showed up in your body

00:26:11.153 --> 00:26:12.696 align:middle line:90%
that you were not aware of?

00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:14.323 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, I
did get an MRI once,

00:26:14.323 --> 00:26:16.241 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really get
to look at the scans--

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.368 align:middle line:84%
so nothing that I've
ever seen show up

00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:21.872 align:middle line:84%
weird there and no x-rays
that I'm aware of where

00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:23.207 align:middle line:90%
strange things have shown up.

00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:25.918 align:middle line:84%
But I do have a dog
tag behind this ear

00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and one behind that
ear-- subdermal.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.255 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've got
implants all over the place.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.257 align:middle line:84%
But most of them
I've never-- excuse

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.884 align:middle line:84%
me-- looked at on an
x-ray or anything.

00:26:33.884 --> 00:26:34.802 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes, I've seen that.

00:26:34.802 --> 00:26:36.136 align:middle line:84%
You showed me behind
your ear there.

00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:36.929 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:38.472 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's
pretty interesting.

00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:41.308 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of the synthetic
implants they put in,

00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:43.769 align:middle line:84%
they make sure that it doesn't
show up on an MRI or x-ray.

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:45.103 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Right, I would think.

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:49.566 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They're using organic
and synthetic materials that,

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:52.236 align:middle line:84%
like you said,
adjust to the body,

00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:54.154 align:middle line:84%
and the body's very
accepting of it.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:54.988 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Right.

00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:56.657 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And I've
seen this in the past.

00:26:56.657 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We've actually pulled a lot of
these implants out of people

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.286 align:middle line:84%
because they were
malfunctioning.

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Right.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.375 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And does your new
clone always have those already

00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.502 align:middle line:84%
in there when you
get in the body?

00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Clone's already prepped
for all of that stuff.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.422 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I also--

00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:14.758 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Now, actually,
interesting that you mention--

00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:17.177 align:middle line:84%
now that you mentioned it, I
do recall probably about five

00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:22.724 align:middle line:84%
years ago I went to go blow my
nose and looked at the tissue

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:26.019 align:middle line:84%
and there was this very
strange, inky, plastic,

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.313 align:middle line:84%
black substance that
came out, and I was like,

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:30.524 align:middle line:90%
what in the world is that?

00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:32.025 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen
anything like that.

00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:33.694 align:middle line:90%
But it looked like a dissolved--

00:27:33.694 --> 00:27:37.489 align:middle line:84%
a synthetic material that had
dissolved in my sinus cavity

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:40.784 align:middle line:84%
and just ejected
when I blew my nose.

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I want to jump
back real quick because one

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of the questions I personally
had for you was how were you

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.877 align:middle line:90%
traveling to these off planets?

00:27:49.877 --> 00:27:53.672 align:middle line:84%
Were you using some
sort of portal system?

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:54.965 align:middle line:90%
How did it work?

00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:57.801 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: You know, there's a
combination of methods there.

00:27:57.801 --> 00:28:00.971 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you're
using jumpgates.

00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:05.684 align:middle line:84%
I would say, when the
travel was a short distance,

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:07.311 align:middle line:90%
jumpgates were often preferable.

00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:09.229 align:middle line:84%
But usually any
length of distance

00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:11.773 align:middle line:84%
was onboard a ship
that would then take

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:13.901 align:middle line:90%
a jumpgate to another location.

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So usually any distance
through space was on a ship.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.949 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you explain to
the audience a little bit more

00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:22.284 align:middle line:90%
about jumpgates?

00:28:22.284 --> 00:28:24.786 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, anybody who
understands what a wormhole

00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.705 align:middle line:84%
is-- basically,
jumpgate's a wormhole.

00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:30.834 align:middle line:84%
So you have an entry
point and an exit point

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that are connected by an
interdimensional wormhole

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.173 align:middle line:90%
connector point.

00:28:36.173 --> 00:28:40.469 align:middle line:84%
So let's see, if we had
the technology right here,

00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:44.306 align:middle line:84%
we could open an entry
point right there

00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:46.016 align:middle line:84%
and then we could
choose an exit point,

00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:84%
let's just say, on the
other end of the property.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.439 align:middle line:84%
And you would be able to take
one step through that end

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:54.483 align:middle line:84%
and you would immediately
come out the other end

00:28:54.483 --> 00:28:56.026 align:middle line:90%
and then back the other way.

00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:59.905 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this a mobile unit
or are there certain places

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:02.449 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth that you had to
report to to go through these

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:03.241 align:middle line:90%
jumpgates?

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:08.038 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Usually a jumpgate
room is like a stable location

00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:12.292 align:middle line:84%
with equipment that's not
super mobile or portable.

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But that technology is
advancing all the time.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:18.966 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine, even though
it wouldn't be my purview

00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:23.303 align:middle line:84%
to say so factually,
that they've probably got

00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:24.972 align:middle line:84%
portable technology
at this point

00:29:24.972 --> 00:29:28.767 align:middle line:84%
that you can make a
jumpgate wormhole just

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:31.311 align:middle line:84%
about anywhere, that goes
to just about anywhere.

00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:34.022 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that
the limitation of distance

00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:39.111 align:middle line:84%
is virtually unlimited, which
from my understanding means,

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:41.488 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, we have
developed the ability

00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:45.117 align:middle line:84%
to get across the galaxy,
possibly to other neighboring

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:49.037 align:middle line:84%
galaxies, but there may be
a range limit that we've

00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.372 align:middle line:90%
achieved at this point.

00:29:50.372 --> 00:29:52.916 align:middle line:84%
But from other ETs
that we've worked with,

00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:56.378 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be just that the
perfection of the technology

00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:59.464 align:middle line:84%
is what determines the
range of such a thing.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:01.591 align:middle line:84%
So I presume the
better we get with it,

00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:03.051 align:middle line:90%
the farther we'll be able to go.

00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:06.263 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Does that
affect any time?

00:30:06.263 --> 00:30:08.015 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Not really.

00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:12.978 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's essentially taking
a distance that's very, very

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:15.105 align:middle line:90%
short and making it like that.

00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:19.151 align:middle line:84%
So you experience
a few instances,

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.528 align:middle line:84%
a few seconds of going
from one place to another.

00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:23.363 align:middle line:84%
In my understanding,
there's no sort

00:30:23.363 --> 00:30:24.781 align:middle line:90%
of temporal effect from that.

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:28.785 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you go in
your suit, your armor,

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:90%
or do you go naked?

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.831 align:middle line:84%
Like, what is the
attire that you have on?

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.875 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Whatever you're
wearing at the moment.

00:30:34.875 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in my bedroom
in the middle of the night

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.548 align:middle line:84%
when I was young, in my
PJs getting taken out

00:30:41.548 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and going through a jumpgate
and then would get dressed up

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.678 align:middle line:84%
in my gear, or if
we were already

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.513 align:middle line:84%
going-- when I was in
the MDF, for instance,

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.767 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we'd already be suited
up and go through a jumpgate

00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:54.561 align:middle line:84%
and then sometimes use that
as an emergency extraction

00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:55.604 align:middle line:90%
to come back.

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.856 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on what
the situation is,

00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:00.317 align:middle line:90%
but whatever is required.

00:31:00.317 --> 00:31:03.278 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned the
suits earlier with the spiders.

00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:04.196 align:middle line:90%
What were these suits?

00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:05.238 align:middle line:90%
What did they look like?

00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:07.616 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, we had two
different sets of body armor.

00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:10.535 align:middle line:84%
We had a light body armor and
we had a heavy body armor.

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:13.288 align:middle line:84%
The heavy body armor is
essentially an exosuit.

00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:16.458 align:middle line:84%
So it's a powered
hydraulic body armor,

00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:20.128 align:middle line:84%
which makes your arms
stronger and your legs--

00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:24.299 align:middle line:84%
you can jump faster, and it's
a very thick armor plating that

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:28.887 align:middle line:84%
can bounce off most projectiles
and most hand-to-hand weapons.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The light body
armor looks like a--

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:38.355 align:middle line:84%
kind of a sky blue wet
suit, but it's not soft.

00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:42.067 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of got a hard
plasticky sort of texture

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:42.859 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:45.445 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little stiff
when you first get into it,

00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:46.988 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
kind of got to break

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:50.534 align:middle line:84%
the suit in like a pair
of shoes or something

00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of the spiders,
we were wearing the light body

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.162 align:middle line:90%
armor.

00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:57.749 align:middle line:84%
I would have much rather had the
heavy body armor on for that.

00:31:57.749 --> 00:31:59.626 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was anyone
injured on that mission?

00:31:59.626 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: No.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.669 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: No, OK.

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.295 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: No, no, the
spiders couldn't bite through

00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:03.088 align:middle line:90%
the armor.

00:32:03.088 --> 00:32:04.297 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, we were fine.

00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:04.548 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:05.048 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Have you ever had--

00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:07.175 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I would have
preferred to have the heavy

00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:08.301 align:middle line:90%
body armor.

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:11.263 align:middle line:84%
I would have felt safer in
it, but it wasn't necessary.

00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:14.599 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever been
on an expedition to these

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:17.394 align:middle line:84%
off-world planets where
someone was injured or attacked

00:32:17.394 --> 00:32:19.354 align:middle line:90%
by another beam or--

00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:20.147 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh sure.

00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:20.814 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --species?

00:32:20.814 --> 00:32:22.566 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Sure,
yeah, plenty of times.

00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:23.358 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:25.152 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Give me an example.

00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:27.028 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, I mean,
certainly when I was

00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:31.491 align:middle line:84%
in the MDF, we would engage
in ground combat with groups

00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:36.079 align:middle line:84%
of indigenous reptoids and
groups of indigenous insectoids

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:38.623 align:middle line:84%
where people would get
injured all the time.

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:42.502 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What did you, in your
understanding of everything

00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:45.714 align:middle line:84%
you'd been through, like,
what was your experience

00:32:45.714 --> 00:32:46.673 align:middle line:90%
and your participation?

00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:49.092 align:middle line:84%
What'd you take
home from all this?

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Wow.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:57.017 align:middle line:84%
Universe is a big place, that
just about anything you think

00:32:57.017 --> 00:33:03.732 align:middle line:84%
might be possible could
be, and that whatever

00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:06.693 align:middle line:84%
you think you might be able to
imagine is possible for life

00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:09.362 align:middle line:84%
to evolve also, again, very
likely to have happened

00:33:09.362 --> 00:33:10.447 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in the universe.

00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:15.535 align:middle line:84%
So as I like to say,
life will wherever

00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:19.789 align:middle line:84%
it can, however it can, and
the variation of evolution--

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:21.208 align:middle line:90%
as well as tinkering.

00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:23.668 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are species that
are tinkering with evolution

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:24.461 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's not always
just natural evolution,

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.382 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it's
engineered evolution.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:33.595 align:middle line:84%
But the ability to create
many, many different types

00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:38.975 align:middle line:84%
of lifeforms is extensive,
and the places that we can go

00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:39.768 align:middle line:90%
are extensive.

00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:84%
The types of planets
that can support

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.359 align:middle line:84%
life, gravitational variances,
gaseous environment,

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.945 align:middle line:84%
liquid environment
variances, it's

00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:55.075 align:middle line:84%
absolutely astonishing to me to
just try and absorb, sometimes,

00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:58.411 align:middle line:84%
all of the possibilities that
I've seen or experienced.

00:33:58.411 --> 00:34:02.499 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty-- it's--

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:03.917 align:middle line:90%
how do I want to say this?

00:34:03.917 --> 00:34:07.128 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it's
toothpaste that's

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.755 align:middle line:90%
never going back in the tube.

00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:11.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of my mind
and my awareness in the world

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.263 align:middle line:84%
that I've lived in that will
never, ever, ever go back

00:34:16.263 --> 00:34:21.016 align:middle line:84%
to being what I would say
a terrestrial mindset of I

00:34:21.016 --> 00:34:25.397 align:middle line:84%
live on a planet and that's
all I know when I understand

00:34:25.397 --> 00:34:29.234 align:middle line:84%
that there are many, many
worlds that contain life far

00:34:29.234 --> 00:34:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and wide with many different
social-political systems,

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.533 align:middle line:90%
monetary economic systems.

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a vast universe out there,
and I feel the most fortunate

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.873 align:middle line:84%
of any human being
I could ever think

00:34:43.873 --> 00:34:46.167 align:middle line:84%
of to have been allowed
to participate in that

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:49.754 align:middle line:84%
because who else can
say that you've been

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.047 align:middle line:90%
able to see or do those things?

00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:52.674 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest,
this is another place

00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:54.884 align:middle line:84%
where I don't care whether
people believe me or not.

00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:58.054 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply feel honored
and privileged to have

00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:00.598 align:middle line:84%
been able to participate and
see and experience the things

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.017 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
able to experience.

00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:04.185 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: After you've been
through what you've been

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:07.814 align:middle line:84%
through and seen so much
and experienced so much,

00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:10.817 align:middle line:90%
everything seems to be possible.

00:35:10.817 --> 00:35:12.485 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Well, certainly.

00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:15.196 align:middle line:84%
And I've certainly encountered
extraterrestrial beings who

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:20.744 align:middle line:84%
have experienced a level of
personal, mental, spiritual

00:35:20.744 --> 00:35:27.625 align:middle line:84%
evolution where understanding
where the mind matter

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:30.253 align:middle line:84%
and energy come
together and the ability

00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:32.839 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate matter and energy.

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:37.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're at
the preschool stage

00:35:37.427 --> 00:35:39.220 align:middle line:84%
of learning how to
manipulate matter

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.764 align:middle line:84%
and energy with our
minds, and there

00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:45.769 align:middle line:84%
are species who are heads and
shoulders above us that are

00:35:45.769 --> 00:35:48.855 align:middle line:90%
still way behind other species.

00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:53.735 align:middle line:84%
And so not only is the
universe an amazing place,

00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:57.489 align:middle line:84%
it's more flexible and
more fluid than also

00:35:57.489 --> 00:36:01.076 align:middle line:84%
most people even could
begin to understand.

00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:02.994 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy, thanks

00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:08.249 align:middle line:90%
