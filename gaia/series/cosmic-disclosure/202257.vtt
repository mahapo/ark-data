00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:10%
and was intimately involved
with UFO ET-related content.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.207 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Now you worked at
Dugway Air Force Base up

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:10%
there are the Proving Grounds.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:10%
Tell me, what were
you doing there?

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, in 1981
the Air Force Office

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
of Special Investigations
at Hill Air Force base

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
received a letter from a guy by
the name of Raymond Petrovsky.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Raymond, in this
letter, described

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that he'd had contact with
an extraterrestrial race

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and that he wanted to
turn the information over

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to a government
agency because he

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
was sure he was suffering a
terminal illness, terminal

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So when OSI received
this letter,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
they conducted a check
through the Department

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
of Defense indices
of information,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
trying to verify the fact, what
he told them in that letter.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Raymond told the
agents that he was

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle line:84%
a retired civilian employment
employee at Dugway Proving

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Grounds as a combat
photographer.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
He'd been in World War II
as a combat photographer

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and he was a retired from
the US Army as a civilian.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Well somehow the
names, Air Force OSI

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
entered the wrong name in the
Department of Defense indices

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and found out that there
wasn't anybody with that name.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So they filed the
letter as a hoax.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, a few weeks later,
he called the office,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.737 align:middle line:84%
Raymond did, and Raymond
explained to them, hey,

00:01:59.737 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:90%
I still got this stuff out here.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
You got to come up
here and see me.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they got the
right information, entered it

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
into the computer, found out
that in fact, Raymond Petrovsky

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
was in fact, a retired
army, US civilian,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
been employed at
Dugway Proving Grounds

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and had been in World War
II as a combat photographer.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What type of pictures
and videos did he have?

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:90%
And were you privy to that?

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, two
agents went out there

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:90%
and found out what he had.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.843 align:middle line:84%
And they referred it to a
special team of investigators,

00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%
and I was one of them.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.647 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's you.

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And I went out
there, and over a period

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
of several months I had
contact with Raymond.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And he told a story
that I think is probably

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
the most interesting story
and most fascinating story

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever heard
about a contactee

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
In 1967, Raymond was
coming home from work

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and he saw this huge object
flying along his property line.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:84%
He lived just outside Dugway
Proving Grounds, a gate.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
He saw this object,
and he thought, well,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
it must be from Dugway or
Hill or one of the bases

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:90%
around there.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, then the craft landed.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And then out came these two
creatures with helmets on.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
They walked up to his
fence and stood there.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And a few minutes later, this
other creature came down.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Now this creature, as
we saw in the films

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
that he showed us
later, and pictures,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:90%
was about seven foot tall.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Very large, very thin, had
a very large and drawn face.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Huge eyes, two small openings
for the nose, small mouth.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Two openings for the ears.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It had a cape, and it seemed
to have some kind of attachment

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
across here, like
a wire or a chain.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And it had a collar,
a large collar.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Just almost like a costume.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like a tunic?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Almost like a tunic.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:90%
But it was open.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.495 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And over a period
of time, this creature

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:10.405 align:middle line:90%
communicated with Raymond.

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's
multiple visits.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Multiple visits,
over a 10-year period.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And during this time period,
during the first visit,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:84%
there was no actual
communications,

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
because even though
this creature had

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a cylinder
that it was speaking into

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.712 align:middle line:84%
and the cylinder was
voicing English words,

00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Raymond couldn't understand
it, because the words had

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:90%
no context.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:90%
There were just words.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:90%
There were no ands, if, buts.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
There was no first
or second person.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So Raymond figured it was
some kind of a translator.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't understand it.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, the creature left,
came back a few weeks later.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
This time, Raymond heard the
creature talking in his head.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And he would, he thought
it was fascinating.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:84%
When I was interviewing
Raymond, I said,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:90%
that's probably telepathy.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I explained to
him what it was,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and Raymond realized that's
exactly how we communicated

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:90%
for the next 10 years.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:84%
During the second visit,
Raymond took photographs.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.223 align:middle line:84%
Now he was a combat
photographer,

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
had been photographer,
retired, he

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:90%
had a lot of different cameras.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
He spent a lot of money
on different cameras.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
A Hasselblad, one of the high
tech ones, a brand new Canon

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
AE-1 and all these
different ones

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:90%
that he was taking pictures.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The ETs, were
they aware of this

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:90%
or were they gun shy about it?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Did he mention, oh, may
I take your picture?

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.327 align:middle line:84%
Or did he just, did they have
a conversation about that or it

00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
just, he just started
taking pictures?

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.702 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He just
started taking pictures.

00:05:44.702 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:90%
And the ETs didn't seem to care.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
The ET, Raymond
would always refer

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.363 align:middle line:90%
to this entity as a creature.

00:05:53.363 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I ask, I asked him, why
are you calling it a creature?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Where was it from?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, the alien's
calling himself a creature.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And probably because
the word creature,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Raymond could
understand it more.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now than
other thing, he

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
explained where he
came from to Raymond.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But Raymond had only an
eighth grade education,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
although he had a
lot of common sense.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Raymond didn't
understand astronomy,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:90%
didn't understand the stars.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't
understand quite what

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:90%
this creature was telling him.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But on one visit, the creature
got out these star charts

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and he pointed to Earth.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And he told Raymond,
that's your home.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And then moved his finger
to this other point

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:90%
and said, my home.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Raymond said he was
pointing to Pluto.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought, eh,
you know Raymond,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it's Pluto.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:90%
And this was in 1981.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a big star chart.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.305 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Pluto is a
planet, but it's real small.

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
could hold life.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
could have been Pluto.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
All along, all
during the time I was

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
with Raymond over
the period of months,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:90%
he was convinced it was Pluto.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But there was one time
where Raymond had bought

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:90%
this atlas of the universe.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:84%
You could get it, it was a
"Reader's Digest" version.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me that,
he showed it to me.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
He opened it up and showed
the visitor, the creature,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
where Earth was, and
he asked the creature,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:84%
where do you live, and
he pointed to Pluto.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, was he telling the truth?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Now Raymond never pictured
that, gave us a picture of that.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
There were some things
that Raymond told us

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that we found out
later wasn't accurate.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, everything

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
he told us about the creature
and everything he told us

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
by his visits could be
verified by pictures.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:90%
He had thousands of pictures.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
He had pictures
of this creature.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
The creature was kind
of hideous looking.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:90%
It didn't have any thumbs.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Had four fingers.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the fingers was larger
than the other fingers.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
There were only about maybe
20 or 30 colored pictures

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:90%
that he took.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Most of the pictures
that Raymond took

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:90%
were black and white.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:84%
He did take an eight
millimeter movie picture.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:84%
He had a brand new movie camera
he had bought in the early '70s

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I think, or whenever it was.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And he took a, he took a, and
you could make color film out

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:90%
of the little eight.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
He took one, and
I think it lasted

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.210 align:middle line:84%
about 16 minutes of this
creature, of this visit there.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that showed this
creature up close.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was only maybe
six feet away from Raymond.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:90%
So it was up close and personal.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
classify that creature.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:84%
We thought it was a
Trantaloid, but yeah, I

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
don't know, it had
to be something else,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:84%
because we had the
pictures to prove

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:90%
that he had contact with him.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So back
to the star charts,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about the ETs
bringing these star charts out.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Were these charts, what
were they made out of?

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, on film, it
looked like a piece of plastic.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And not being there,
Raymond didn't really

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:90%
explain what it was.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was a huge,
it was probably

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:90%
three foot by two foot.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge chart.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
That it seemed like the way
it looked from the movie

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that he filmed, they
pulled it out of something

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:90%
and they set it down.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was glossy in
appearance, it had depth.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: It was dimensional.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:90%
We have a picture of it.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:90%
He took stills of it.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, he took a
lot of pictures of this chart,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
so they left it there for
him to take pictures of.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted him to
know or maybe wanted

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:90%
him to give to somebody else.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And he did scan it
with his camera.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But we, we had an
astronomer look at it.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't understand it.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't plot, we
knew where Earth was,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
he, but nothing seemed

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
to jive with what our chart or
our solar system would appear.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think, when
we look at our star charts

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
here on books and on our
computers, they're in the 2D.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just flat.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps maybe what do you think?

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.125 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this was in a 3D,
so it threw everybody off.

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We
thought of the fact

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that this star chart
that he's showing

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Raymond was photographed from
space into our solar system,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:84%
however they did that, and so
it's distorted to our view.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a view from that.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we do have one
from horizon that was just

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
filmed in 2015,
but before that, we

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't have a view from space.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And so it's probably distorted.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And the three
dimensional aspect of it

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.280 align:middle line:84%
distorts our view of
where Earth would be

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and where his planet would be.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Probably 10 or 12 light
years apart rather

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:28.970 align:middle line:84%
than Pluto being how
far, whatever it is Pluto

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
is from Earth.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.133 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Raymond was
convinced it was Pluto,

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:84%
but we thought, eh, no, I
don't think it is Pluto.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sounds like
the conquered definitely

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
dimensional space
travel it seems,

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds like they
have also possibly gone

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:90%
inter-dimensional as well.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, Raymond did
say, and in a crude manner,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
we kind of drew it
out of him, and I

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:84%
wasn't talking to him at the
time, one of the scientists

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But we said, we asked him,
did they explain anything

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:90%
about their travel?

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
They explained that they could
go from one point to another

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.910 align:middle line:84%
faster than we can go
from one point to another.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And we asked him, now the
scientist is talking, I'm not,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:90%
but how are they doing that?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.232 align:middle line:84%
Are they going faster
than the speed of light?

00:12:25.232 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know,
but they showed me

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
some things in a hologram
how they could do it.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
They would set up this, well,
he didn't call it hologram,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
but later on, they
would set this up

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and it would be a dot
over and a dot over here

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say that they could
move this dot closer, well,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
bending the fabric of space
as some scientists say

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
we could do, or finding maybe
a wormhole someplace that

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:90%
could go from another.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, it's fantastic.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it was great
that they picked Raymond

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and in layman's terms, he was
able to discuss it with you

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and open up to the
scientists as well,

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:90%
giving a different perspective.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's also
why they chose Raymond.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, Raymond had a
crude way of explaining things.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.093 align:middle line:84%
But I tell you, he had
a lot of common sense.

00:13:15.093 --> 00:13:16.635 align:middle line:84%
He might not have
been that educated,

00:13:16.635 --> 00:13:18.563 align:middle line:84%
he had eighth grade
education and whatever

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
he picked up after that, but
he had a lot of common sense.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
He could reason things out real,
rationally reasoning things

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.955 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know how to explain it
when he reasoned it because he

00:13:27.955 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:90%
didn't have the vocabulary.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.688 align:middle line:84%
He might go a roundabout
way of explaining things,

00:13:31.688 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
but then you could get the gist
of what he was talking about.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.735 align:middle line:84%
And these scientists, I
mean, I'm not a scientist,

00:13:36.735 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
but these scientists
were understanding

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
what he was saying, what
Raymond was explaining to them

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:90%
about how they traveled.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:50.012 align:middle line:84%
And they were convinced it was
maybe inter-dimensional travel.

00:13:50.012 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, mm-hmm.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Or they could
bend the fabric of space

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and travel faster from
one point to another.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was he
shown any technology?

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He was shown
a lot of technology.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
The creature would
bring out this plate.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:90%
He called it a plate, a tray.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
He said a tray
with a plate on it.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And you see it in
a picture and it

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:84%
looks like a tray you
might make cookies on.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there was some
kind of protrusion.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And this creature
was able to show

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:84%
things coming out of this
place, out of the plate,

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:90%
like holograms.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And the holograms would
move and would tell a story.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Now he only took,
Raymond only took

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
one movie of that showing
the holograms moving.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But he took, he'd taken some
still pictures later on.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Raymond didn't understand it.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
He didn't understand what
this creature was trying

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:84%
to explain to him,
because everything

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
was going through his head
after the second meeting.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
He was hearing the
voices in his head.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But he also told us
that this creature

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:03.035 align:middle line:84%
was throwing so many voices
in his head, not voices, but.

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Information.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.225 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Information.

00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:05.025 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: That Raymond
couldn't keep up with it.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of things that
was lost that Raymond should

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
have remembered,
but he couldn't.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Put these holograms
just fascinated us,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:90%
and fascinated Raymond.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:90%
How did he do this?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Raymond
couldn't understand it.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:90%
We had some knowledge.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I had a scientist with
me during these talks

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
with him, interviews,
and he could

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
explain how we could do
it even back in the '80s.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So these were things
that fascinated him.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
explain technology to Raymond.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But Raymond just
didn't understand it.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, they chose
him for something.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They chose
him for some reason.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And looking at everything
that Raymond had,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
there had to be some
kind of a reason for them

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:90%
choosing somebody like Raymond.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they choose a
scientist or astronomer

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:90%
or a doctor or somebody?

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:90%
They just chose.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, here
you have someone

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
who's a professional
photographer in the military.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they know something
about the future

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:84%
that this was going to be
released to help us move on.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: That's possible.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
later on, I think

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the
theories that we had.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The scientists, the
people that analyzed

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:90%
his mountain of information.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, there were
thousands of pictures.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
There were probably 30 or
40 eight millimeter movies.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And there were
some other, he had

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:84%
a camera that could take
large portrait-type pictures.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember what
the name of that camera was.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:90%
But he took a lot of them.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:84%
He actually took a picture,
several of them, of the crew.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
The whole crew of
this craft came out.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The ironic part about it is,
this creature that he met

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
was probably two to four
feet taller than all

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:90%
the other crew members.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And the creature
looked a lot different

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:90%
than these other creatures.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
Now you're talking
about humanoids.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.089 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Programmed lifeforms.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Programmed lifeforms.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
I think these other creatures,
as Raymond was explaining to us

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.239 align:middle line:84%
was a security detail,
but I'm sure some of 'em

00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:90%
were crew, other crew members.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:84%
There were four
creatures that never

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
communicated with
Raymond, but you

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:90%
could see 'em in these films.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And they had an object
they were carrying.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was a weapon
or maybe a translator device.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:10%
But they all had helmets on.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:10%
And these helmets were
really thick helmets

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:10%
and they had protrusions like
they had goggles on their eyes.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was never
explained to Raymond,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and Raymond could
never understand it.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But these were probably the
security detail, probably

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.297 align:middle line:84%
something guarding
the larger creature.

00:17:53.297 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
others in the background

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that had nothing on but
real tight-fitting suits.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And they looked a lot
different than the creature.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:90%
They were smaller.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:90%
They're probably five foot.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:84%
They had something on their
head, maybe a really light type

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:90%
of helmet.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.713 align:middle line:84%
But they were always
in the background

00:18:11.713 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and you couldn't
ever really see them.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
You could see, you
could see their persons,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but you couldn't get them, you
couldn't see them up close.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.878 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many were spread
around this group photo?

00:18:22.878 --> 00:18:24.295 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: There
were probably 15.

00:18:24.295 --> 00:18:26.897 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
number exactly, 12 to 15,

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did
this craft look like?

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: The craft was huge.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:90%
The craft was like a house.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It had protrusions on
the top and the bottom.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
It had these other protrusions,
almost like vents right

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.753 align:middle line:90%
where the ladder came down.

00:18:43.753 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There was a ladder?

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
The ladder would drop where
the creature would come down.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they climb
down it or did just hover?

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, no, they
would walk down a plank.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Like a plank.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
The creature was the
only one that used that.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The other crew members
of the security detail

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:84%
came down a ladder that
was coming straight down.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.858 align:middle line:84%
They would just climb down
the ladder, not the ramp.

00:19:05.858 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And that was on video.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: That was on video.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.505 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's impressive.

00:19:09.505 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Many videos of that.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
He would set up, although
he was never told,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.665 align:middle line:84%
Raymond was never told,
the creature never told,

00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
back next Tuesday

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
or actually Wednesday
anything like that.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
He knew it would be 10,
15, 20 days, maybe a month.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:90%
But he had cameras set up.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
He had actually built these
coverings for his cameras

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
for inclement
weather, just in case.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And he had them all ready.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So when they came, he
just had to turn them on.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:84%
He brought electrical
source out,

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:84%
so he could just
turn on the cameras.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
When he got it, he got this
craft coming in for a landing,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
landing and leaving,
flying away.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:90%
He said.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he know when
they were going to come?

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.315 align:middle line:84%
Did they say, hey, we're
going to come by tomorrow?

00:19:54.315 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, no,
he didn't know.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He didn't know.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.925 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They would
come back to visit him.

00:19:57.925 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:90%
And he would expect them.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't, there
wasn't a regular type.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that he said
that the creature couldn't

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:90%
understand was their calendar.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:90%
He brought out a calendar.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he took
still pictures of it.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't a video.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But it took still pictures of
him with a camera over here,

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:84%
showing this
creature a calendar.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And Raymond said he had no
idea what I was talking about.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.375 align:middle line:84%
He didn't understand
what a calendar was.

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now why was he
why was Raymond doing this?

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Like, what was his intention?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:90%
To keep this to himself?

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
To later share it
with his family?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, first of
all, Raymond was an orphan.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:84%
He was born in 1922 in
Virginia City, Nevada.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
He had an aunt that put him
in an orphanage, Catholic

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:90%
orphanage in California.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And he lived in the
orphanage until he was 15.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
He ran away from the
orphanage, went back to Nevada,

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:84%
worked in a mine until he
was 17 and joined the army.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was trained as a combat
photographer World War II.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
He served his time,
got out and in '46.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Worked in a mine in Nevada and
eventually got a job at Dugway.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't have
a lot of education,

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and he didn't have any family.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Never married,
never had children.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And he really said he didn't
have a lot of friends.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.245 align:middle line:84%
So when it came
time to do something

00:21:25.245 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
with all of this stuff,
when he went to the doctor,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
doctor said, you're
going to die.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And another thing Raymond did,
was he was a chain smoker.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:84%
All during the time
I had contact him,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.233 align:middle line:84%
he probably smoked four to
five packs of cigarettes a day.

00:21:38.233 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
there's anything special

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
with his DNA or
just him alone that

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.352 align:middle line:84%
was attractive to these
extraterrestrials?

00:21:47.352 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Funny you
should mention that.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
They did take, they
did take his blood.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The ETs or we did?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, the
ETs took his blood.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion, and he, this
was an after, afterthought

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:90%
on his part.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
This was towards the
end of my visits.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:90%
He was real sick.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
He would cough and cough
and cough and cough,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:90%
because he had lung cancer.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was just one
last thing he told us.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.595 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, by the way,
they did a physical on me.

00:22:15.595 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do
you mean a physical?

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:90%
He said, they examined me.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, did they
did they take any fluids?

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
they took my blood.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And they took some of my
skin and they took my hair.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, why did they do that?

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:90%
He said, they just did it.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why they did it.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:90%
They didn't hurt me.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I just thought that
maybe they were,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to see what
my species was like.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when
I asked him, I said,

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
did they offer
anything from you?

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could get
something from them?

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And then he showed, he
had a box, a wooden box

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:90%
that he'd opened up.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And this was an afterthought.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Because we had
everything else packaged up

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to take.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, I wanted
to be buried with these.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:90%
And they were figurines.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And each one was a
different figure.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was like it
maybe was a goddess,

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:90%
some kind of a goddess.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.268 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was
it made out of?

00:23:08.268 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Some kind of a clay.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
ever really realized

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.297 align:middle line:90%
what it was made out of.

00:23:13.297 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
was disappointing to me

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:84%
is, I spent all this
time in doing probably

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
15 or 20 reports, I
looked at all this stuff,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
but we had to
package just stuff up

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and we had to ship it to Defense
Intelligence Agency at Bolling

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Air Force Base.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And I would call them
almost on a regular basis

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.268 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, what's
your analysis showing?

00:23:37.268 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you the report later.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We'll get
you the report later.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.118 align:middle line:84%
Well, [INTERPOSING VOICES]
I never got a report.

00:23:45.118 --> 00:23:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's very
frustrating, very frustrating.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.577 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Very,
very frustrating.

00:23:48.577 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Being an investigator
of your caliber and meeting

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:84%
with these amazing people that
have this amazing experience.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you also confiscate
the figurines?

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes, we took 'em.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.300 align:middle line:84%
He was reluctant, because
he told us, I wanted to,

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to be buried
with these things.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:11.447 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, they're just,
they'll just be nothing to us.

00:24:11.447 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:84%
We might be able to study
this and find something.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.665 align:middle line:84%
The material that it's made of
or maybe the meaning behind it.

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you guys didn't
take any of his blood tissue

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.213 align:middle line:90%
samples or DNA?

00:24:21.213 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes we did.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, we sure

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.937 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's
standard protocol.

00:24:24.937 --> 00:24:26.688 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Because
we had a doctor come,

00:24:26.688 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember what visit
it was, but we had a doctor

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and we had our own
physician at OSI.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
He came in and we thought
maybe the creature's contacts

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:90%
caused his illness.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we took, they took, we
took him to a Hill Air Force

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Base and they did, I
don't know exactly,

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't there when they did
this, but they examined him.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:55.290 align:middle line:84%
They took lung tissue, they
took other things to examine.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's part
of the material

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that went to headquarters that
I don't know whatever it found.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.892 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:01.892 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you guys confiscate
his body after he passed away?

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: No.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.403 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want it.

00:25:07.403 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, could
you describe for us

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
how the craft in the
videos were landing,

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:90%
how they were taking off?

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Do they have some
sort of stabilizers?

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Did they just hover there?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The first
one, the first video

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
we had was it coming
in for a landing.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:90%
It came in really, really fast.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was photographing
this from a distance,

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:84%
so he obviously had been out
there watching this or looking

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
It was coming in
from the southwest,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:84%
because his fence
pointed to the south.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It was coming in
from the southwest.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:90%
It came really fast.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:90%
You could see it.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
It kept getting bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.940 align:middle line:84%
You could see it
was moving fast.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And it would slowly stop,
right, and hover right

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:90%
over where it was going to land.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at,
this is something

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
we went back and looked
at in the photographs,

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:84%
it landed at the exact same
position, that same place

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:90%
every single time.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So as it came in,
it slowed down,

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
struts would come out
from I don't know where,

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and it would land, just
like a flying saucer.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the ladders
would drop down.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
The security detail,
we would say, came out.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And then a few minutes
later, the ramp would drop

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and the large creature
would come down.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And he also had a
very, very good motion

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:84%
picture, movie picture, eight
millimeter of it leaving.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
The creature went up.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Once the ramp went up,
the security details

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.910 align:middle line:90%
got into the ladders, went up.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:90%
There was a bright blue glow.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was very prominent.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.707 align:middle line:90%
Blue glow.

00:26:44.707 --> 00:26:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't see
this on the landing,

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:90%
but we saw it on takeoff.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was a colored
one that he had taken.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Blue glow came from the
bottom of the craft.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And the craft would rise slowly.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't fast.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there a
dust or trees moving?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, no dust,
nothing, no, no, no, no.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
going to say next.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:84%
The debris seemed to
stand still on the ground.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
If there was any other type
of craft, even a hovercraft

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
or something taking
off, debris would

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.820 align:middle line:84%
be all over the place
like a helicopter.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.682 align:middle line:90%
Everything remained still.

00:27:20.682 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't understand
that either,

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think the
aeronautics people

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that we showed this to
understood it either.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It would take off
and probably got

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to I would just
estimate, 500 feet,

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it was slowly take off
to the same place, southwest,

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:90%
and then shot away.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Just like speed of light.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Hmm.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: And that was it.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Brilliant.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Were there any scents or smells
from the beings or the craft?

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.348 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: When he was
allowed onto the craft,

00:27:48.348 --> 00:27:49.890 align:middle line:84%
the creature took
him on to the craft

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
to show him the
interior of the craft.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And immediately when he got in
there, he smelt this strange,

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and he described it to
us and then we told him

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:90%
it was probably ozone.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's what it was.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we were able to
get a canister of ozone

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
not at that visit, but
another visit, and sprayed it.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:90%
And he said, that's the smell.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
All over the craft
with this ozone

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:90%
smelling material or odor.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the only
odor he ever detected.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But we asked him also, did
the creature emit an odor?

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.505 align:middle line:84%
No, he could never
detect an odor.

00:28:29.505 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you think
the significance of this ozone

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.208 align:middle line:90%
smell was with the craft?

00:28:34.208 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I wouldn't
have known what

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
it was, but one of
my experts that I

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:84%
had brought with me thought
it had to do with the gravity.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Manipulation of
the gravity inside,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:84%
he said we can do this with a
craft in an experimental way

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:90%
and there's an ozone smell.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it manipulates
the molecules.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they think
it was, that the gravity

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
or how they were able to
manipulate the gravity.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Now there were
occasions when Raymond

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.535 align:middle line:84%
said they were trying to
explain things to him,

00:29:07.535 --> 00:29:09.785 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't understanding
what they were explaining.

00:29:09.785 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And maybe that's
what they were explaining.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: High amounts of
energy, like lightning bolts,

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.410 align:middle line:90%
make this ozone too.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: That's
true, that's true.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's probably
a large amount of energy

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
that's being expelled
for this craft

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.307 align:middle line:84%
or around the craft for
it to maneuver around.

00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Rick, tell me about the
inside of the craft.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
You said you saw some
videos, some pictures.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.233 align:middle line:90%
Could you depict what you saw?

00:29:31.233 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: There were seats
where apparently the pilots

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%
or co-pilot sat .

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't any
instruments that we would see

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:90%
in an aircraft or a spaceship.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any levers or
toggles or anything like this.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:90%
But there were hand plates.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And he explained it, the
one thing that Raymond did

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
explain to us, he said
they flew by their hands.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.420 align:middle line:84%
They put their hands
in these hand plates.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And these hand
plates were all over.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There were probably a dozen
different places where they

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.330 align:middle line:90%
could put these their hands in.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And the only screen he
saw was this huge screen.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:11.990 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't on.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.700 align:middle line:84%
He didn't see
anything out of it.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:90%
But he saw this big huge screen.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said to us, it
was like a TV screen.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you see
any edges or corners,

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.308 align:middle line:90%
or was it seamless and round?

00:30:22.308 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: No, it was seamless.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
That's another
thing that was odd.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:90%
It was all seamless.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything was so
manipulated in a way

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that there wasn't any edges
and with sharp corners

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.310 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It was all circular, it was
all, he called it matted

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:90%
gray in color.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things, another
thing he was fascinated by

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:84%
was the floor of the
craft seemed to give.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It was like he was
walking on something.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And he would, he
walked to the left

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and then he came
up into the area.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But he walked through, he
said, through a bubble.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.580 align:middle line:84%
When he came out, they took
him to another location

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:84%
where there were individual
rooms or maybe quarters.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And they did have in, the
only one he actually filmed,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:84%
it was a small cubicle
with what looked like a bed

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:90%
and what looked like a bench.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.303 align:middle line:84%
But that's the only thing
that was, oh, and a screen.

00:31:26.303 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the only thing.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Now no one to explained
to, the creature

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
didn't explain to Raymond
that this was a crew quarters

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:90%
or what it was.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And he walked back around
and then he went down

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:84%
a level, another level, and
he said as he got lower,

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:84%
it was like he was
walking in quicksand.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Although when he looked down,
there within any quicksand.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like the floors,
the floor was giving.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:84%
It was, and he thought,
he was fascinated by it.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
He was scared at first.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But the creature said, no, no,
you're all right, keep walking.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:84%
He got down what he says
was the engine room.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And all you could see
in this engine room

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:84%
was a huge round circular
device with some lights flashing

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.430 align:middle line:84%
on it and this protrusion
on top with he said,

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.130 align:middle line:90%
a light bulb, which shoot up.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they turned it
on or something for him,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.753 align:middle line:84%
but the camera was facing
the other direction.

00:32:27.753 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And he told us, he said, well,
there was a light bulb that

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:90%
shot up in the air.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, you didn't get that?

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, no I was
facing a different way,

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:90%
but he said I saw 'em do it.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Hmm.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So that
was the only time.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And then he walked back out.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:90%
He went to a top, a top area.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said it kept
circling, it was a circle.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:84%
He got up there and you
could see out these windows.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.438 align:middle line:84%
And he could look
all the way around.

00:32:56.438 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:84%
He could see his house, he
could see all the way around

00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.810 align:middle line:90%
from this top.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%
But he said was real small.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:90%
He had to really crunch down.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:07.426 align:middle line:84%
Raymond was maybe
5' 8", 5' 9", so he

00:33:07.426 --> 00:33:10.530 align:middle line:84%
had to really almost
crawl to look.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But another thing Raymond
said, on the outside,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't see that.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.818 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:33:15.818 --> 00:33:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It was
like you're looking

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.790 align:middle line:84%
at just something black, you
couldn't see any windows.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.998 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was he recording
sound when he was in there?

00:33:21.998 --> 00:33:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Did you hear the
background noise

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:84%
of other extraterrestrials
communicating

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
or the vibration of
the ship perhaps?

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The only
video we had with sound

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:35.990 align:middle line:84%
was one he took towards
the end of the visit,

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:90%
the 10-year period.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
No, there wasn't
any of those moving

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:90%
pictures didn't have any sound.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And we asked him about that.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.570 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's not easy to do.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:84%
At least back in those
days, it wasn't easy to do.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we found out,
one of the things,

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.650 align:middle line:84%
he's supposed to be an
expert, one of the things

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.407 align:middle line:84%
that we found out when
he gave us a camera,

00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
there was a way to do
the sound, but he just

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:90%
couldn't figure it out.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so there
wasn't any sound.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't a
sound from any craft.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:84%
What Raymond did do, was
after he came off the craft

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and after the craft left,
he made a little video

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.750 align:middle line:90%
of myself talking about it.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just went
into the creature's craft

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:84%
and I saw these places
where they put their hand

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:90%
that they could fly the craft.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I saw where they had
to be strapped down,

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
so there must be no
gravity in the craft.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:90%
He talked about it.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.478 align:middle line:90%
He kind of narrated it.

00:34:30.478 --> 00:34:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Not in a detailed manner.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.389 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's great though.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:33.189 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:34:33.189 --> 00:34:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But he did explain
some things to us.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, and one of the
things he asked him was,

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.240 align:middle line:90%
do you have a bathroom in here?

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.040 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't understand
what a bathroom was.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that didn't happen.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:52.219 align:middle line:84%
That creature never went
into Raymond's house.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:84%
He never left the other
side of the fence,

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.950 align:middle line:84%
because Raymond had a
chain link fence, a small,

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
about a four foot chain link
fence around his property.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:84%
That creature would come up and
stand on his side of the fence

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and Raymond was on
his side of the fence.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So he was.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He was on the south
side, he was on the north side.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Raymond invited the creature
in a number of times,

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:17.417 align:middle line:90%
but the creature said no.

00:35:17.417 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was there a gate there?

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.432 align:middle line:84%
Did Raymond just hop the fence
each time with his equipment?

00:35:21.432 --> 00:35:24.015 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, all the equipment
was on his side of the fence.

00:35:24.015 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: All the cameras
were on his side of fence.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Raymond never went on the
other side of the fence.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, to
get in the craft

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I thought you would have to.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.267 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Well, yeah, yeah.

00:35:31.267 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:84%
There was a gate at
the, would've been

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the west, probably the
west end of his backyard.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the gate he
used to go inside.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.690 align:middle line:90%
But he only was in there once.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:84%
But every other time he's
remained on his side.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And we ask him
again, why would you,

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:90%
why wouldn't you shake his hand?

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't you?

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, it was just the way
he wanted it, they wanted it.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.625 align:middle line:90%
You stay there, we'll stay here.

00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't if they
didn't trust him.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But you figured after 10 years
of having contact with the guy.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.057 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They would
have trusted him enough.

00:36:03.057 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And plus, he offered
him on one occasion,

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and this was filmed
too, he had snacks.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.430 align:middle line:90%
He had--

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Milk and cigarettes?

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: No, no cigarettes.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:19.957 align:middle line:84%
But milk, cookies and I
think sandwiches and fruit.

00:36:19.957 --> 00:36:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's fantastic.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They took
the fruit, but they

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:90%
didn't take anything else.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.370 align:middle line:90%
They took the fruit.

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And the creature
picked up the, or I

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.540 align:middle line:84%
think the film showed
Raymond handed it.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Raymond was left-handed too.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.850 align:middle line:84%
He handed him across
the fence, the apple.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:90%
It was an apple.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.814 align:middle line:90%
And the creature took the apple.

00:36:39.814 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So they're vegetarians.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He never
saw him eat it.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that he
took, I think, he looked,

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:84%
you could see the alien
look at the apple like,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what this was.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And then handed it off to
one of the security people.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think probably
they were just

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
going to figure out
what that thing was.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They definitely trusted
him just to grab something out

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:90%
of his hand.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.485 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes.

00:37:03.485 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's an
amazing amount of trust.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.548 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes.

00:37:06.548 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't
take anything else.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
They declined any
kind of nourishment,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:15.580 align:middle line:84%
other than the apple, which
was kind of strange to me.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But then we thought about
it more and we thought,

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I bet probably
never seen an apple.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
it was, so they're

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:84%
going to take it in and do
experiments on it, figure out

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:24.790 align:middle line:90%
what this thing is.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What about Raymond?

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever tell you like,
did he ever say maybe

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:84%
or did you ever
ask him, why do you

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:90%
think they picked you for this?

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.815 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Oh, yeah,
at the end we did.

00:37:36.815 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:90%
We asked, we asked him.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:90%
He said he didn't know.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
He said he thinks it
was just by chance.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.370 align:middle line:84%
They were just coming in and
saw his trailer and landed.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you
think, do you think

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:90%
they're in contact with others?

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, I know they are.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.305 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know they've
been to other states.

00:37:56.305 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, how do you know that?

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, they told me
they traveled around.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things he asked them was,

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.250 align:middle line:84%
did you meet any other
humans other than me?

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And they admitted that they had.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:84%
They didn't go
into details, they

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.890 align:middle line:84%
didn't say anything
like how many

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
or where, but it was just
Raymond's thought process that

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.422 align:middle line:84%
said, yeah, I think they
probably seen other humans.

00:38:20.422 --> 00:38:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would you
say this is some

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
of the most factual
video and photography

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever
seen in your career?

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Absolutely.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the most amazing
story of an alien contact

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever heard
of or ever seen or been

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.220 align:middle line:84%
associated with in all my career
as an intelligence officer.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.070 align:middle line:84%
This was totally
100% believable.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how many of these
investigations have you've

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.310 align:middle line:90%
done in your career?

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Many, many of them.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is with evidence.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
not with evidence,

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:84%
it's just with somebody's
telling a story

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and maybe has some
indentations on the ground

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:90%
where some craft had landed.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:90%
But this had everything.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Evidence, documents, film.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.640 align:middle line:84%
How can you film
something like this?

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.350 align:middle line:84%
How can, how can, I
mean, how could you

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:84%
fake this film with a guy
that had an eighth grade

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.637 align:middle line:84%
education and these aliens that
are, how do you dress them up?

00:39:17.637 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A decade of this.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: How do you
make something like that?

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
There's no, Steven
Spielberg couldn't

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.180 align:middle line:90%
have done a set like that.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Wow, Rick,
what a compelling story.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I love all the facts
to it too as well.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, great investigative work.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Rick, thanks for
being on the show.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: You're very welcome.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:90%
