00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:17.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here with our
guest, Emery Smith.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hi, Dave.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me again.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: In a
previous episode, we

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
were discussing
some kinds of things

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that might happen where perhaps
somebody is shifty and nervous,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and they're looking around.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.217 align:middle line:84%
And they come up to
you and they say,

00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
there's something I
really want you to know.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if
I should tell you.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.789 align:middle line:84%
And I asked you, did
that ever happen?

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
And what was your answer?

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's just review that first.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There is
something similar to that.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't usually
happen that way.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It usually happens after
someone's been in a project

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.146 align:middle line:84%
for a very, very long time,
longer than you have, even.

00:00:58.146 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And they see that you've
been in there a long time.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.186 align:middle line:84%
So they know that you're
doing something right

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:90%
because you're still there.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And at the lunch
table, you might

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:90%
be sharing some information.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:84%
You might become
friends, which you're not

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
allowed to become
friends with anyone, even

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
inside these compartmentalized
programs or outside.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:90%
But it does happen.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:90%
And I did have friends.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well,
now, wait a minute.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
On a typical military
uniform, there's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.897 align:middle line:84%
a name, like in the
Army or the Marines.

00:01:22.897 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you have names on
your uniforms in there?

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no names.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:90%
You only have the band.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are you allowed to
tell people what your name is,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:90%
or is it even--

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
You're allowed to have casual
conversation, they say.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So people talk about
their families, what

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
they did over the weekend,
common things you hear

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
normal people talk
about-- movies and TV

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
shows and funny
jokes, of course.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of jokes are
said during lunch

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that people come
up with that also

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
reflect on some of the
projects that we work on.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't talk about
the project, so it's OK.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you could get
to know somebody by name

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and remember their
name and talk to them.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.094 align:middle line:84%
Did you also have
outside the cafeteria

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
any recreational areas
that you would hang out

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:90%
with these people in?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, not
recreational areas.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But I became friends with
a lot of the commanders

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of scientists that
were in the same projects.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And I did illegally meet with
these scientists and people

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
for social gatherings,
dinners, and barbecues.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:84%
You think because
it's your commander

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
inviting you to the
barbecue that-- and he's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
been in it for 10, 20
years more than you--

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that everything's going
to be all right, right?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the fact.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:90%
That is not a fact--

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:90%
that it's not all right.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And they put these in
place-- these rules--

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
so these things don't happen and
that the information does not

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:90%
fall into the wrong hands.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the commanders on one
of the projects I was working

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:84%
on I became really close with--
a really good friend of mine.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go mountain
biking together.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:90%
We had motorcycles.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Just one of my
buddies, you know?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.986 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were you allowed
to have a mountain biking

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
expedition with the
commander off base?

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Or is that not--

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:90%
You're not allowed to.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember visiting him and his
wife and my girlfriend and I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
many times out to
eat and things.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And we would never really
talk about anything

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to do on the base.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
We were really good about that.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But during our lunch hours
and during other hours

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
of trainings in these
underground facilities,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:90%
you do talk sometimes.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
People slip up and start
talking about things.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
he mentioned to me

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
was this amazing
craft that he was

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
going to get me involved
with possibly to work on

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and to actually
try out the flight

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
simulator of an alien
reproduction vehicle.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.135 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, had
you ever gotten

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to see any craft
before this point?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I did see a craft before this
point but not to this extent.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.756 align:middle line:84%
And they were not alien
reproduction vehicles.

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, what is an
alien reproduction vehicle

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:90%
for those who don't know?

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: When we have craft
that we find or unearth

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
or shoot down or
collect from space junk

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
or collect from some
other place in space,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:84%
it's brought to
these facilities.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
try to reverse

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
engineer these craft
to the best that they

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:90%
can of their abilities.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So this
commander buddy of yours--

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.067 align:middle line:84%
sounds like you guys
had really gotten close.

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
You're going mountain
biking with him.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.191 align:middle line:84%
You're having dinner
with his family.

00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Did you guys get chipped?

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Could they have
GPSed you and know

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that you were having
dinner with this guy?

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Not that I was aware of.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I actually got caught with
the commander in a location

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that I was not authorized to
be in because of my clearance.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And everything went to hell
in a hand bag after that.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, this is a story
you told me many years ago.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's unpack
this a little bit.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Where were you with the
commander when he first

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:90%
told you about this?

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And what did he say you
might be able to see?

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There was a actual
extraterrestrial craft that

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
they had captured and brought
into one of the underground

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:90%
hangar operating rooms--

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:90%
the whole vacuumed one.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And inside that, they
were duplicating it

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
in the same room, trying to
reverse engineer the craft.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So they started with
the inside of the craft.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of like
the craft was opened up,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and you could cut it in half.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was a diamond-shaped
craft, and it wasn't that big.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.084 align:middle line:84%
It was probably no bigger
than an 18 wheeler.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So when you
say diamond-shaped,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.809 align:middle line:84%
could you be more precise
about what that means?

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
What would it actually look
like if you had to draw it?

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like a
piece of fluorite.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It's an octahedron.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: A pyramid on top,
pyramid on the bottom.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:90%
That's right, but laying down.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So the points are
out, not up and down.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's laying this way and
balancing itself perfectly.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
So they made this.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to do that.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you said it's
about the size of an 18 wheeler?

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It's really small.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.273 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And what was the color?

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was gold.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It actually had a light
to it-- a very nice light,

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.374 align:middle line:84%
like these lights are
on us on our face.

00:06:03.374 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So it glowed?

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very subtle.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Very subtle.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And it had a very
metallic surface.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So it would reflect light
if you shined light on it.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Seamless again?

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Seamless, except for
the edges of the octahedron.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you
said it had already

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:90%
been dissected or something.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, no.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:84%
The craft that they
were making next to it

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
was just-- they were trying
to find out how it works

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
and how it flies around.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
a lot of stuff

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
with the actual
electromagnetics of it.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So they duplicated
a half version.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:84%
They cross sectioned a
man-made half version.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like just
half of the octahedron?

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.064 align:middle line:84%
You could cut it
down the middle?

00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, exactly.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
How did you get there if
you're not cleared to be there?

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're not authorized to
be there, how in the world

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.388 align:middle line:90%
would you get into that room?

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There is a
stipulation if you're escorted

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
by someone of high authority.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the times,
for emergency reasons,

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to certain
places really quick.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And as long if you're with
someone that has a clearance

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
higher than you, then
the responsibility

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
falls under that
person for legal issues

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and for everything.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But everyone knows that if
you're not read into a project,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
it's very unlikely you would go
see something without knowing

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:90%
everything about it.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was not read
into the project.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I was read into the
project clandestinely

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:90%
through my friend.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Walk us
through what happens.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.483 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So we got
down to this floor.

00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:90%
The door slides open.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And we walk down a hallway
around maybe 100 feet or so.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
normal vacuum door

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that we would see
that slides open,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
just like you see regular
elevator doors that slide open.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:90%
But these are very thick doors--

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:84%
extremely thick,
about 24 inches thick.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:10%
Once these doors open,
there's a platform.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
This platform goes another
maybe 30 feet with railings.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And it completely drops down
to an abyss that you cannot see

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:90%
the bottom of.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And the walls are
completely covered in rock,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:84%
just like you would
see in a cavern--

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:90%
just pure solid rock walls.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And that-- the room I'm about
to go across this catwalk--

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.626 align:middle line:84%
is a dome room that
the craft is in.

00:08:15.626 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these
different bridges

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
going to this
self-suspended operating,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:90%
pressurized, giant room.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you had to get
through these 24-inch thick

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
blast doors just to get to
the catwalk through the cave

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.649 align:middle line:90%
before you get to the dome part.

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:33.565 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, exactly.

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very secured, for sure.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why they
have this room suspended away

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:90%
from walls maybe a hundred feet.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.766 align:middle line:90%
So you have this giant room now.

00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
You're walking into it
with multiple catwalks

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.677 align:middle line:84%
from other doors
that go into it.

00:08:49.677 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you come there,
and the same thing.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
These doors open
up-- the same doors

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
that you just saw,
another 24 inches.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:90%
And now you're in the bay.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the two craft were.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Describe now what you
see and how do you approach it.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's a large,
round room with a dome top

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:90%
that goes very high.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly how high--
at least a few hundred feet.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And the floor is
completely mirrored in

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:90%
a metallic, mirror-type tile.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And the tilings are
in a hexagonal shape.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And they're very large tiles.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:90%
They're maybe six feet--

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:90%
these hexagon tiles.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
used for electromagnetic.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.466 align:middle line:84%
There might be
something under there.

00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking maybe they used
it to shoot frequencies up

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
to this thing because both craft
are now touching the ground.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
But these things weigh
a couple kilotons.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, something is
supporting them unnaturally

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're not used to
having here on Earth--

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
some sort of anti-gravity.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.325 align:middle line:84%
One of the craft is the
original, of course.

00:09:58.325 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the second one
is just for instructors

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to fly this craft.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was
your experience?

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.027 align:middle line:84%
Were you afraid to talk and to
say how awesome this looked?

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Did you say anything
to the commander?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, I did say it.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, this is amazing.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:90%
This is awesome.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for allowing me
to be part of this project.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I really just thought this is
my first introduction maybe

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm maybe
going to be part

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:90%
of this in some way or another.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm really curious
about this flight simulator

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Could you go into a
little bit more detail

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
about what is the
actual experience.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Are you seeing stars?

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And do you zoom around Jupiter
and Saturn in the simulator?

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:90%
What do you actually do?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete description of
3D reality of the entire planet

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.471 align:middle line:90%
and the oceans.

00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Of this planet.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Of this planet.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't show anything
going off planet, by the way--

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
nothing further than
the moon, I mean.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, they
have complete simulations

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
of the moon structures,
also inside the moon.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
The coolest thing
was the oceans here.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It's things you would
never have seen before.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's just
written as a program,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe so.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an exact replica of
stuff they already know about.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine plugging
into Google Earth times 1,000

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
with some virtual reality
glasses and being able to go

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.334 align:middle line:90%
anywhere.

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was
cool about the oceans?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, the oceans--

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:84%
we only know what the oceans
just from Google Earth

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and what we've learned
from the encyclopedias.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Not many people can get into
a sub and explore the oceans.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And we know more
about our own space

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:84%
than we do our own oceans,
and everyone knows that.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And the seat is actually
part of the craft.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:90%
So there's not like a chair.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:90%
It's actually molded.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:90%
I'll say a mold of a seat.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that in front of
that is this huge dashboard.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And this dashboard has
many screens in it.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:90%
It has many holographic images.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It has joysticks but
made for your hand.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Your hand slips in them.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a reverse
glove, I guess,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:84%
where you're putting your
hands into this glove area.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And your palms fit nicely
on a smooth ball surface.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
turns everything on.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So he was beginning to teach
me how to fly the craft.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.557 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you got to
sit in this cockpit?

00:12:23.557 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I flew the craft.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Inside the dome?

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this was a simulator.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why it had
a big screen in it.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
reverse engineer the seat

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things
they've seen in there.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:90%
And then this was fake.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.210 align:middle line:90%
This was a big screen.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a simulator of that craft.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So they were training
clandestine pilots

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:84%
how to use this craft
with these balls things

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:90%
that your hands slide into.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very comfortable
seat, by the way.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would this
morph for your body?

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just a nice,
comfortable shape?

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It felt very--

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:90%
it was very plasticity.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.705 align:middle line:90%
It didn't contour to your body.

00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:84%
It didn't morph to you,
but it did give way.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So your elbows and
everything-- you

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
had to be sitting in
a certain position.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
reclined a little bit.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And you're sitting back
like this with your hands

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.075 align:middle line:90%
in these weird--

00:13:20.075 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the seat,
by the way-- the gloves.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.533 align:middle line:90%
Don't think of gloves, everyone.

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Think of just holes in the
seat that your hands perfectly

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
fit on these balls
that are in there.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And after going into the
simulator for a number

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:90%
of hours--

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:90%
at least three or four hours--

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I just remember hearing that
horrible sound of the doors

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
opening because everything
echoes in there.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
You hear everyone's
conversation--

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:90%
There's no carpet or anything.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
You can hear a pin drop
from 100 feet away.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's just this dead,
beautiful silence and just

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:90%
our voices.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
doors open, they

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
have this very
interesting sound.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like a--

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
if you ever had a
piece of plastic.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I always refer to
X-rays because you

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:90%
know how the X-ray paper is?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And you shake it, and it
goes rah rah rah rah rah.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, these doors do that.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:90%
They just come right open.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And they have this rah rah rah
rah rah rah-- this really weird

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:84%
vibrational noise
that's just not

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
common to hear on a
mechanical door, I'll say.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard
that, I looked at him.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, are there
other people coming?

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:90%
He says, no.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
No one is allowed to
be here right now.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.057 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the suits came up.

00:14:40.057 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you
mean by suits, exactly?

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was
figuring on him being

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate commander here
being in charge of anything.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.251 align:middle line:90%
No one's higher than him.

00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So how are any security going
to say anything about this?

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I legitimately
thought this was OK.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was not.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And these suits are
people in black suits.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This is not a clean
area, by the way.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to have
your space suits in here.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.470 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
call a "dirty area."

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can just be in
your uniform there.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.599 align:middle line:90%
And these suits came in, four--

00:15:09.599 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are we
talking suit and tie?

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.223 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, suit and
tie, four or five of them.

00:15:13.223 --> 00:15:15.689 align:middle line:84%
They were all taller than
me and bigger than me.

00:15:15.689 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Are we
talking men in black,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
like with the hat
and sunglasses?

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
No hats or sunglasses.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Just a normal, big guy,
but very professional.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Not security either,
but they could be.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.526 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember them
grabbing him by the arms

00:15:32.526 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and just pulling him
away of the thing.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they told me
to get out of the chair,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and I just got the chair.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And they put my hands
behind me and zip tied me

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:90%
and blindfolded me.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the last
time I ever saw him.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:90%
In your whole life?

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Walk us through this now.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I know this part is very
painful, but tell us.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So you have some kind of
bag put over your head.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.830 align:middle line:90%
You're zip tied.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.017 align:middle line:84%
How long was it before
you got into the room?

00:16:02.017 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
What did you experience
along the way?

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Was it in a vehicle?

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was a long walk.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.198 align:middle line:84%
I was in three
different elevators.

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a very long
walk, and I was

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to trace my steps to
where they were taking me.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But then they put me on one
of these electric ground cars

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're very small, but
they can hold four people.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But think of it as a
toboggan-type thing

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:90%
but double the size.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.285 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
in a different language

00:16:27.285 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:90%
that I do not know.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Last thing I remember--

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It didn't
sound like any Earth

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle line:90%
language you're familiar with?

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe it
was maybe Navajo

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:90%
or some other Indian language.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It sounded just an off
beat of Navajo language.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I know a little bit of that
from living in New Mexico,

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't understand it.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And they spoke it very fluently.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.704 align:middle line:84%
And they would break in and
out talking in English to me.

00:16:48.704 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did these
people look like they

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:90%
were from Earth otherwise?

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were genetically
modified humans for sure.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Somehow they were
genetically modified

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.340 align:middle line:84%
because they were just
a little bit too large.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.440 align:middle line:84%
They all looked a
little bit too similar.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were very professional
and smart and very,

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:90%
very strong.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What type of race of
people on Earth would they be?

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They were white.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:90%
Their race was white.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:90%
They had blue eyes.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:90%
They had different colored hair.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.467 align:middle line:90%
They were dressed very nicely.

00:17:19.467 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And extremely muscular?

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Extremely
muscular and large.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is intimidating
right off the bat.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.441 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was
scared, very much so.

00:17:29.441 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Were they
carrying anything

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.398 align:middle line:84%
like a weapon or something on
them when you first saw them?

00:17:33.398 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, not at all.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But they were
forcefully handling me.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was being very
compliant, but they were still

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:90%
handling me very forcefully.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And what happens next?

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They take me out of
this vehicle into a small room.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.659 align:middle line:84%
I ended up did getting my
blindfold taken off at the end.

00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why I can describe
it ahead of time.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:90%
But I was blindfolded.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle line:90%
I had my uh--

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:90%
arms were zip tied behind me.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And they told me to
sit down in a chair.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.534 align:middle line:84%
And there's three chairs and
a table in a 10-foot room.

00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was struck in
the back of the head

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
numerous times in
the neck and also

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
in the stomach by some
sort of instrument,

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
like a baton maybe or something.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:90%
And I did go unconscious.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I was bleeding from
the back of my head,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:90%
but nothing on my face.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.385 align:middle line:84%
They then sat down and decided
to ask me a lot of questions.

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were
asking me questions

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
of how long did I know about the
project, what did he tell me.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I admitted to having
a friendship with him

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:84%
on the outside with his
family, which they already

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:90%
kind of knew.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
But we never talked
about any of that.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I asked if I could get
some medical attention

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like I was
losing a lot of blood.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And a person was brought in.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And they basically just applied
some direct pressure to me.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And they told me to go home
and that they would contact me.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you have contusions
or a concussion afterwards?

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I had a concussion
and a big hematoma

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:90%
on the back of my head.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I was petrified to go report it.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe that would--
and I think they were testing.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
was the next test.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was because I
didn't say anything.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
got my job back--

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.052 align:middle line:84%
because I was able
to keep a secret.

00:19:33.052 --> 00:19:34.010 align:middle line:90%
And the secret hurt me.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What is it
like to be in that place

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
where you feel completely
powerless, you're handcuffed,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:84%
you can't see anything,
and you're just

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:90%
getting savagely beaten?

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
What was going
through your mind?

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Did you think they
were going to kill you?

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I just
thought this was it.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even saying
anything because I

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:90%
knew what the contract is.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And you don't mess
up the contract.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And even though I was misled,
I didn't know that it was a--

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
touchy situation.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It was such a touchy
situation, because did

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Smith do this intentionally?

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Was he intentionally trying
to do harm to the facility?

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, he was
escorted to places

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.105 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't have
clearances through someone

00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:20.521 align:middle line:84%
that had a higher
clearance, which

00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:90%
is allowed at certain times.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:90%
But not at this time.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:90%
This was not--

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I guess this did not
correlate with whoever

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
is really running this.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:90%
He did not probably report--

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.595 align:middle line:84%
maybe he did have to
report to someone.

00:20:34.595 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:90%
He has never told me.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see it this way.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
This was definitely
civilian compartmentalized

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.659 align:middle line:84%
with military leaders
that were in there.

00:20:46.659 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Did I do something wrong?

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
All I know is I did
something wrong.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I figured, well, obviously, I'm
here in a really bad situation

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be killed
probably, and that's it.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:90%
So I was accepting that.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was broken
down enough until they

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:90%
took the blindfolds off.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
looking up at them.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And they just said never
to repeat this again.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you say anything
or do anything,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:90%
you know what happens.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew at that point,
well, I'm not going to die.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Why would he be talking to me?

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Why would he looking up at me
as I'm looking up say this to me

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and giving me, obviously,
another chance?

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:90%
So I was sent home.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:90%
They said, we will contact you.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Do not come to work tomorrow.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And I did not want to go
home because that must

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.544 align:middle line:90%
mean I won't be coming back.

00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:90%
But then I thought, well--

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.235 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How did
you get home if you

00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
were in an unfamiliar
part of the base?

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.659 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, no.

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:90%
They escorted me out.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:90%
I was already back to my area.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
That's what all that driving
and going up and down--

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
they did take a DNA
sample from me--

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:90%
a cheek swab.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And they took blood
from me, which

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.561 align:middle line:90%
is normal when things go weird.

00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I've heard this before--

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that they do this to anyone
that's caught in other areas.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was restricted from
ever trying to contact him

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
or his family ever again
"for the duration of my life

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:90%
on Earth," quote unquote.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So then you went
home the normal way

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.410 align:middle line:84%
that you would have
from your work.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, with no delay.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:90%
I literally was so freaked out.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I really thought
I lost everything.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought I lost my career
and my job with them.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many horrific
stories of this happening

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.759 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would
never happen to me

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:90%
because I played by the rules.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And this rule they didn't like.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
They didn't like
what had happened.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing they were
saying was just to go home.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:90%
We'll contact you.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.260 align:middle line:90%
So I thought I was out of a job.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd lost
all my clearances.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought everything
was just going

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
to go down the tubes for me.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought even my career
with the military--

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I thought this would
affect it somehow.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I did go home.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And I still went to work the
next day for my military job.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.202 align:middle line:90%
And then a day--

00:23:03.202 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: The cover job.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.118 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The cover job.

00:23:05.118 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And then a day after, I got
curious and went on my mountain

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
bike and wanted to do a
little investigation of my own

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
to go around the mountain
up there by this place where

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
we talked about how the
commander had alluded

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to some amazing things
going on up there.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:10%
If anyone looks on Google
on Kirtland Air Force Base

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:10%
or if you're flying
over to land at ABQ,

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:10%
everyone knows about the
mountains hollowed out there.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:10%
And there's these giant
doors in the mountain where

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:10%
they used to keep all
the nuclear warheads back

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.860 align:middle line:10%
in the early days.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And now they're used for
storing other things.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And he did mention this--
the commander-- to me

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:90%
during one of our excursions.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that there was
something going on up there,

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
have the clearance

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:90%
to be in or near that facility.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:84%
However, since I'm
active duty member,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
there is a bike trail
that goes all the way

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:90%
around that facility.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
There's also four
or five fences,

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
guard dogs, and MPs at
all the entrances going

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:90%
into the area of the mountains.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And those service roads is
what I use to mountain bike

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:90%
a couple of times a week.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%
But I was young and curious.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought maybe
if I go up there

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I might be able to catch
a glimpse of something

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and see what's going
on coming in and out.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Also, using special
goggles and stuff,

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
you can see different
energy fluctuations

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.169 align:middle line:90%
that I was issued at that time.

00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so I went around.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was mountain biking
around this facility

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and probably looking
at the facility more

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:84%
than looking at my
bike trail, I presume.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:51.165 align:middle line:84%
And three-quarters of the way
around, I became deathly ill.

00:24:51.165 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was getting
nuked from the inside out.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And I still had
another eight miles

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:90%
to go back to my barracks.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And I did make it back.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I made it back,
I curled up into a ball

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and I prayed to
God to just kill me

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.705 align:middle line:84%
because it was the most
excruciating pain I've ever

00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So what do you
think happened to you

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:90%
based on what you know now?

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think that
was a scalar weapon.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
It felt like your entire insides
are on fire and you cannot do

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.600 align:middle line:84%
anything to make
the pain go away.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:90%
You go into the fetus position.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like someone
is just getting your insides

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and just twisting them up
and lighting them on fire.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was just so horrific
that I went unconscious

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.092 align:middle line:84%
and possibly could have
maybe died at that point.

00:25:39.092 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So just
so we're clear, do

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
you think there's
some sort of emitter,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
like a beam weapon, that
they pointed at you while you

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:90%
were riding your bike?

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Later on, I found out they do
have scalar technology that's

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:90%
all pinpointed.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:84%
They could do it right through
the Earth here and hit someone

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:90%
in China-- just that person--

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:90%
and neutralize them.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Spontaneous human
combustion-- no.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not that.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It's these types of
weapons that they use.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.067 align:middle line:90%
So these things do happen.

00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So did you
wipe out on your bicycle

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.950 align:middle line:90%
when they hit you with this?

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.708 align:middle line:84%
I just slowly started getting
worse, worse, worse and worse

00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and worse and worse as I'm
coming down the mountain.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.175 align:middle line:90%
And I made it.

00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I should have just went to
the hospital or something,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:90%
but I kind of knew where I was.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And I've heard of these stories.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.610 align:middle line:84%
They were just myths amongst
the people that worked there.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't really know know.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.629 align:middle line:90%
Now I know.

00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, you
told me before that

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:84%
as a result of getting
zapped with this

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that you had a post-traumatic
stress disorder that developed.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you explain a
little bit about what that is?

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.159 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, any time I
get any type of weird feeling

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
from energies or something,
it could trigger me.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Certain situations in life--

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.520 align:middle line:90%
that might trigger me.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
You just go into an
anxiety panic mode.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
You might not remember what had
happened the last hour or so.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:90%
You can even blackout sometimes.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I've actually just shut down and
woke up in the bed going, wow.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty intense.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're
lying in bed now.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:90%
You've had head wounds recently.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:90%
You said you had a hematoma.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:90%
You had a concussion.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Now you've had this outrageous
directed energy weapon attack.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
At this point, did you
know if you were ever

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to work again?

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
What was going
through your mind?

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It wasn't until
the day after when I woke up

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
from being unconscious
just in my barracks

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
from this beam weapon
that I had a message.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.335 align:middle line:84%
And it was to report
to duty at this time.

00:27:45.335 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I did meet
with three people.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But these were not
those guys in the suits.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
These were the people
I always work with.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And they just said, don't
let that happen again.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I won't.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:90%
I got my job back.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How did this event
change you in terms of how--

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
because you said you were very
enthusiastic about your job.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:84%
You felt like you were
in an amusement park

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:84%
almost-- an alien
amusement park.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.117 align:middle line:90%
How did this change that?

00:28:16.117 --> 00:28:18.325 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There was some sort
of continuity breakdown,

00:28:18.325 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I thought.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't
believe in them any more.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe
in the structure.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Who the heck is behind this?

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Who is pulling the cords?

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Who is really running
this show down here?

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Who were those guys
in the black suits?

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.482 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
mad, like going mad.

00:28:42.482 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to figure
it out for myself,

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.106 align:middle line:84%
and now I can't even
talk to anybody about it.

00:28:46.106 --> 00:28:51.189 align:middle line:84%
I can't even-- to my own
coworkers I can't say anything.

00:28:51.189 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I know you
can't get too specific.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But where would this commander
be in the US military hierarchy

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.107 align:middle line:84%
let's say in relationship to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who

00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:84%
report to the President
of the United States

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.981 align:middle line:84%
and are the heads of each
branch of the military.

00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Where would he be in
that relationship?

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's all
based on clearance.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
You can be a captain and
have the same clearance

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:90%
as a general or a colonel.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.770 align:middle line:84%
You can be a sergeant and
have the same clearance

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.830 align:middle line:90%
as a captain or a colonel.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's the
duties that you perform

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and what is needed
to get the job done.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the--

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
they don't use the
military system of rank

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:90%
for these positions.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
They use the knowledge
base and educational base

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of the people that are put in
place to run these projects.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So as far
as you knew then,

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
it's not like this
commander might

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
be a member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.070 align:middle line:84%
or some big head
wig in the military.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But within your
classified ecosystem,

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.054 align:middle line:84%
he was almost as high as it
could get for your information.

00:29:57.054 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: He was the highest.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.386 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: He was the highest?

00:29:59.386 --> 00:30:02.332 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The highest
that I knew in my area.

00:30:02.332 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think there
was anyone higher that

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:84%
had more clearances to
go anywhere in that base.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.995 align:middle line:84%
And he never gave
you the impression

00:30:09.995 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that there was
anybody like that?

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is quite a story.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Tragic, but also I think very
revealing of the sacrifices

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that you have had to make to
get to where you are today

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:90%
to tell us this information.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel to finally
have this story be shared

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.599 align:middle line:90%
with the world at this point?

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I just want everyone
to know what's really going on.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And I want it off my
shoulders so other people can

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
come forward and
share and for them

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
to feel-- because I know
they're in pain, too.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a hard thing to grasp and
to understand unless you've

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:90%
actually been there.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's a lot more
Emerys out there like myself.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And they just need
a little maybe

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:84%
help from an interview
like this to get

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:84%
them to come out and join us to
let the people know they have

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.570 align:middle line:84%
the right to know about all
these amazing things that

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:84%
are going on down there
that can help humanity.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, where is all

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.390 align:middle line:84%
of that money going
for taxes that we pay

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:90%
and things like this?

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.185 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of corruption.

00:31:18.185 --> 00:31:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Even though these things
sound cool to some people,

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.242 align:middle line:90%
like sci-fi movies, it's not.

00:31:23.242 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It should be something
that is frowned upon.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.717 align:middle line:84%
And the goodness should come
out of it, not the bad parts.

00:31:31.717 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I want to thank
you for stepping forward.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.809 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that we do get
more of those insiders.

00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for watching.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:90%
