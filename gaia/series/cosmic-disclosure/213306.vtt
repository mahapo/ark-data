[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who served

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Today, we discuss UFO
sightings in Antarctica.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.553 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When did Antarctica
become this hotspot for UFOs?

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I think we have
to go back to the early days

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:84%
of the '40s, 1940s, when the
Germans spent a lot of time

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:90%
and effort down in Antarctica.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
They sent their submarines down
there in the '40s to establish

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:90%
a base down there.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
there's a number

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
of German articles and books
written about what they saw

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
and what they experienced
down there while they

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:84%
were trying to establish
a base in Antarctica.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
The Germans had
visions of the future.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Hitler wanted-- he was
a paranormal person,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:90%
a psychic himself.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And he hired psychic people
to look into the future

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:90%
and look at the Third Reich.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And so he sent these
submarines down there.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
down there, they

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:90%
experienced strange phenomenons.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know what
UFOs were back in those days,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
but they'd seen them
and they monitored them.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And they actually had,
as Tim told us once,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
had contact with an
extraterrestrial race down

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So UFO sightings
down in Antarctica

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
has been going on
for a long time.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So Richard,
what did the Germans see?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
They had their subs there,
did they see it on sonar?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Were they going topside and
watching these craft fly around?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, the first
contact they had was underwater.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the submarines, a
very, very first submarine

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:90%
that made it to Antarctica.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
back in those days,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
the submarines weren't like
the submarines they have today.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And they do have-- they did
have sonar and they had as--

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
they were approaching the
northern side of Antarctica,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
which would be
near McMurdo bay, I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
think today, they experienced
some major large object

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:90%
in the water.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And they call it "major"
because in submarine terms,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:90%
major and minor disturbances.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
know what it was.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, as the submarine
approached the shoreline

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:84%
of Antarctica, this
thing, this object

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
that they were tracking
on radar surfaced.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And so as a submarine surfaced
and approached the shoreline,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and the German sailors got out
of the submarine onto the deck,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.657 align:middle line:84%
they saw this major huge
object parked on the ice.

00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What did it look like?

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: It's a
round saucer shaped--

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.035 align:middle line:84%
as it was written in the
report, German Navy report,

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:90%
it was a saucer-shaped objects.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, they first thought
that it had to be an enemy.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they
were fighting a war

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, early days
of the war in Europe.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
The United States had just
entered the war and at that time

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:90%
frame in the '40s.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So they thought it could have
been-- it must be an American

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
or it must be some other
country, maybe even

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:90%
the Russians.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:10%
Because if you go back as the
German submarine was traveling

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:10%
from Spain and that was
their port to Antarctica,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:10%
they encountered a
Russian submarine.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:10%
And it was a brief
encounter where

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:10%
they knew that Russian submarine
was going in the same direction

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:10%
as they were going.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, jump ahead.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, was there already a Russian
base there in Antarctica?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the submarine commander
or the crew didn't know,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:84%
but they see this object,
a saucer-shaped object.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
They didn't see anybody
around it, any occupants.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:90%
But they saw this.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they kind of
scared them in a way

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.653 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
prepared for that.

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was
their response?

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.365 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they surf--
they went back under.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:19.165 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:19.965 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They descended to some
distance and they moved away

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
from that location
to another location.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the first
time the Germans had ever

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
been to an Antarctica.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:90%
So they had mapped it.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the missions of that
submarine was to map Antarctica.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, they knew about the United
States missions down there

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and what our explorers
saw, but they

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
didn't have access to what the
mapping system was down there.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, down there, the
compasses acts very strangely.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Of course, yeah.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So they couldn't
rely on their compasses.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And their mission was to land,
to survey it, try to find

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:90%
the best port to establish.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But now, before that,
they encountered

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.245 align:middle line:84%
this major huge object,
a flying saucer,

00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:84%
although they didn't
call it a flying saucer.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So they moved a few kilometers
away from there to another port.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And as they surfaced and pulled
into this-- on one report,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
they put a landing
team on the ice.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But the landing team
was always concerned

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
about that object that was a
few kilometers away from them

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
to their left.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
they saw that object

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
rise up into the
atmosphere and disappear.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they wondered,
well, what could that be?

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The technology wasn't
anything that they knew about

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:90%
at that time period.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So that submarine did
their thing on the ice.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
They were there for a month.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.447 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed
to stay longer,

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:48.878 align:middle line:90%
but they ran out of food.

00:05:48.878 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
They got back into
submarine, they took off

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and they had to go
to get to Spain.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, they had
to be refueled, I think,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the second submarine
that went down there

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:84%
was in 1944, before
the war ended.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:90%
That was in December the--

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and they knew they
knew that weather

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:84%
changed from the northern
to the southern atmosphere.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So they went down there this
time in late December of '44,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I think before they
went in the summer.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.958 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, yeah, in
the summer realized

00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%
it was winter down there.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So they went down there
in a different time,

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
different submarine,
different crew.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And as they got down
there, they encountered

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
a number of underwater
objects and they

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what they were.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
They thought that they were the
only ones down there but then

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
again, they encountered
these things.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
This time, this submarine
surfaced about the same place

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that the other submarine did
because the other submarine had

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:84%
placed certain
things on the ice.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And as that submarine
surfaced, they

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
encountered another object,
a flying saucer on the ice

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and little beings
walking around.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:90%
This scared the commander.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what to do.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
communications with Berlin.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%
So they had the commander--

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Schmidt was his name--

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:90%
thought, well, now what do I do?

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my own down here.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I have armament.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Do I fight this thing?

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:90%
What are these things?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:90%
And he actually thought--

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
one of his crew members actually
said, these little beings

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:90%
live here.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
This is their home.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.018 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: This is their home.

00:07:28.018 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: So then now that was--

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
a book was written
some years later

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:84%
by the German saying the little
beings live in Antarctica.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But-- so he thought,
well, now we

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
have to make contact to let
them know we're friendly.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So they attempted contact but
as they got off the submarine

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and approached with
weapons, these little beings

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
got back in their
spaceship and took off.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they realized,
I don't think they live here.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
from someplace else.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first encounter
or first sighting of UFOs.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Now from that point on,
it grew exponentially,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:90%
the sightings, the contacts.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
In the '50s, when
we went down there.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The first established base down
there was in the '50s, and we

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
encountered strange anomalies
in the air and under the ice.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And one particular
encounter that

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:10%
was reported in a navy,
United States navy, logbook

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:10%
was Naval personnel was on the
ice establishing, setting up

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:10%
tents and so forth at one
particular place, which

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:10%
eventually became McMurdo Bay.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.752 align:middle line:10%
They looked and they saw
something come out of the ice--

00:08:46.752 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Looks like
a missile launching.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And they thought
it was a missile launching.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And they thought then,
oh my god, there's

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
somebody else has established
an underground base here.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:10%
But the more they examine
the camera, because they

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:10%
had a motion camera, a motion
picture camera going on

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:10%
at that time, they
realized it wasn't anything

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:10%
that they'd ever seen.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a conventional rocket.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, we had rockets
in the early days,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:84%
were experimenting
with them, New Mexico.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they thought oh my
god, that's not a rocket.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:90%
That's something else.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So then they, of
course, connected that

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to the Russians, the soviets.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.543 align:middle line:84%
They thought, oh, Soviets
have established a base.

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Everyone's thinking
it's the other person.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
crew that came down

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
there was the Marine
force because they thought

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
if the Russians or the
Soviets had a base down there,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
we have to have a security
detail down there.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they brought a United
States Marine Expeditionary

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.575 align:middle line:90%
Force down there.

00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:46.117 align:middle line:84%
I think it was one
company of a 220--

00:09:46.117 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's a lot.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --marines that
was established there.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And that eventually
led to treaties

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that occurred through
the United Nations,

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
establishing Antarctica as
being a non-military zone

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't want a
war being fought down there.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It was for exploration only.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So there was a treaty in 1961
in the United Nations that set,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
established a parameters
regarding who can go there,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.760 align:middle line:84%
what kind of military
force or security force

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
can be there but it's
a non-military zone.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Even today, if you
do not join the United Nations,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
your country is not allowed
to go to Antarctica.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.115 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That tells
a lot right there.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.085 align:middle line:90%
And as a United Nation--

00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't realize

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
United Nations police

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
force down there that patrols
and they watch for that.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And each country takes turns
sending forces down there.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's a way around that
and we've figured that out.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And we did establish,
eventually,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.003 align:middle line:90%
a military force down there.

00:10:53.003 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why do you think
there's so much UFO activity

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%
down there, Richard?

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, over the years,
there's been not hundreds

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
of cases, but literally
thousands of cases of UFOs

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
landing or being
seen over the ice.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:84%
There's an incident that
happened in the '60s where

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:84%
a United States force or
team went to Antarctica,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%
the South Pole, the actual
spot of the South Pole.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And during that time period,
they saw a number of UFOs,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and they called them UFOs
back in those days, land

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in front of them.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And they would stop
and just watch 'em.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
They didn't ever saw any
beings coming out or humanoids

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
coming out of these crafts,
but they saw them landing.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So they figured there must
be a base down here someplace

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:90%
of these.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they went
and did their thing

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and came back from
the South Pole.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
But they reported this.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And now the United
States government,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
without any assistance from
the other countries who

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
were down there, France, Britain
and, of course, Soviet Union,

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:84%
they decided to try to set up
some kind of detection system

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to detect these things and
find out why are they down here

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:84%
or is there a base here
and is it under the ice?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
were trying to do.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our exploration
of the South Pole led to,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
is finding these huge
caverns under the ice that

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:84%
must have been made by something
other than a natural phenomenon.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Or a prior
civilization, maybe.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So would you say that is
the establishing factor

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:84%
of the military
presence in Antarctica?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Absolutely.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
That they perceived that there
was an extraterrestrial base

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
down there or a civilization
living under the ice down there.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you also explain
to the audience when you said

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:84%
there's thousands of these
accounts of visualizing craft,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
but there was multiple countries
that were reporting this?

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.592 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just the
United States that

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
was reporting these sightings
or observations of UFOs flying

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:84%
around the South Pole,
it was other countries

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.340 align:middle line:90%
that were reporting it.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And they cooperated, at
least between the British

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and the French, I think,
and the Canadians.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know how
much cooperation we had

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:90%
with the Soviets at that time.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:84%
But the other countries were
all reporting the same thing.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So it was a conglomerate
of sightings and countries

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
pooling the
information regarding

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
the sightings and identification
of flying saucers at that time.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, is there any
relationship between the weapons

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
testing and the presence
of UFOs in Antarctica?

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.767 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, that gets into
some really sensitive areas.

00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was that later
down the road here?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, later
down the road there was.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.365 align:middle line:84%
We did some testing down
there and this is, of course,

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
sensitive, but it's been
out on the internet,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to talk about it.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
We had a program called
Project Zeus where

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
we developed the
weapon that was-- we

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
didn't know exactly
what it would do.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And we developed a
defense industry.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:84%
They did a very, very small
test of that weapon system

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Nevada test site, and it
caused a great deal of damage.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to
find a place where

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:84%
they could test
the full capacity

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
of this weapon
and the only place

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that they could
figure out to do it--

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.048 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: There you go.

00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: --was Antarctica.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they took it down
there covertly, clandestinely,

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.257 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want
to talk about it.

00:14:35.257 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's other people
who've talked about this.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.525 align:middle line:90%
...and some of her people.

00:14:40.525 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they found a cavern
that they could get into.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
going to test it,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
but they were only going
to test 25% of its power.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
do that test, it

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.325 align:middle line:84%
opened up a cavern, hundreds
of thousands of square meters.

00:15:01.325 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And they first thought
that the weapon did this.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they started examining
how this cavern opened

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and they realized that cavern
had been there the whole time.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And this weapon just cleared
out some of the old gases

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.912 align:middle line:90%
or the old snow.

00:15:19.912 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So this was just an
accident because they're just

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:90%
testing it.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't brought down there
to enter the cavern, right?

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:84%
This was just a hey, we overshot
and wow, look what we found.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And we
opened this cavern.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.340 align:middle line:90%
A huge cavern.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They say it's about the
size of western United States.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:90%
That's how big this thing is.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So they realized
that if you look

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
at the land mass of the South
Pole compared to what this shot,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
this experiment caused or
something that had already

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
been down there, they
realized that this was so big.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
It was deep, deep, deep
under the South Pole.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something a
few feet under the ice,

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.847 align:middle line:84%
we're talking thousands
of feet under--

00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Miles and miles.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, under
the South Pole.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And now that presented
all sorts of ideas

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:90%
about what could have made this.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, then
they find as they-- again, I'm

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
talking about
somebody else's story.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But as they progressed
to explore this area,

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:90%
they find plants.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Where do these plants come from?

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.620 align:middle line:84%
How do these plants grow in an
environment of the South Pole?

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a question
I don't know--

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't have an answer to.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.705 align:middle line:84%
And none of the
other UFO researchers

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:84%
who have done this and talked
about it have figured it out.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure the United States
government have sent people

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
down there, botanists or
agriculturalists that figured it

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But how can, under the
ice, plants can grow?

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the answer to that.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They utilized
chemogenesis with the ice

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:90%
and the soil.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting the
minerals and nutrients

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
through the chemical
makeup of that area.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And it has all it needs, just
like in the Marianas Trench,

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
where the volcanic vents are,
and you can't-- it's boiling

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.065 align:middle line:90%
water, but it's full of life.

00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
It's all because
of the chemicals

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
from inner Earth
coming up, which

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:84%
are really rich in different
minerals to support life.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, it
makes sense to me.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's the update.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That makes sense to me.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So tell us where
in-- well, real quick,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:90%
I have one thing to add.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but wasn't that cavern now,

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that is the first
base that we built.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the new entrance to
the underground facility?

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's--

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Is that correct?

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: As I understand,
yes, you're right.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's the first base.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
more after that.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
This happened in the
early 2000s and now,

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
we've advanced and we
found other places.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, expeditions
have found places

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:90%
that they classified it.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to talk about it.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
We just know that there
are places under that ice

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
that are unique and probably
extraterrestrial in nature

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:84%
or probably had some kind of
extraterrestrial civilization

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And they base that on what they
find down there and what they--

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
regarding the structures of the
ice and the formation of things

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
in the ice that we can't do, we
can't figure out how to do that.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But some civilization
has figured that out

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to protect those caverns
and to provide heat

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
in the caverns and
things like that, that

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:90%
doesn't melt the ice around it.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know when I went
to winter survival school,

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.275 align:middle line:84%
we built these little
igloos and we'd--

00:18:57.275 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Stays warm.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --seal the inside with
steam so we could stay warm.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
entirely different than that.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: This is a mass scale.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: A massive scale that I
don't know that they figured out

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:84%
how this was ever
created or constructed.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rick, we spoke about
these ice tunnels and there was

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
an incident with two individuals
that went down in a sled.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us this
and elaborate about that?

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The team that was
exploring Antarctica

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:84%
some years ago
found these tunnels.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And they sent in
automated sleds,

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
didn't have anybody in them,
to a number of these tunnels,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:90%
but they never found anything.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
They would go for eight hours
and never found anything.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
One particular time, they
put two individuals in there

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.633 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure if
they were military

00:19:45.633 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:90%
or if they were civilians.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And they sent them down in
this one particular tunnel.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And when they got
an hour or two in,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
they noticed that there was a
branch tunnel off to their left

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and they reported that on
a landline communications.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And the control area
told them, well, we're

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
going to send you down and once
you get down, you come back.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
You can take that extra
route to the left.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:12.940 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I came back and they
moved into that branch.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And they moved for a
couple hundred yards maybe,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and they came into a room that
was lit, a severe circular room.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And what they noticed all around
was like embedded into the ice

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
was pictures of another planet
and of extraterrestrial beings

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:84%
all over on the ceiling,
on the floor, on the sides.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How
large is this dome?

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Probably a
hundred feet high.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Huge dome.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what did
these extraterrestrials--

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:84%
can you depict what they
said they looked like?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They looked
like gray beans.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
described them at.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But what was unique
about it is they

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:90%
were looking at their planet.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
At least it looked
like another world.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a
holographic sense.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But there's pictures
of different settings

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Not just one particular
setting, but a desert setting,

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
a setting with trees, another
setting with some type

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
of structure, and there's all
these different pictures that

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
they refer to as
"pictures" all over.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And they notified the
authority where they were

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and what they were seeing.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And they said, well, take--

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
they had a camera with
them and to take pictures.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But what was strange is
they started feeling--

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
their body started
tingling inside there

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and they thought that they
were experiencing a lack

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:90%
of oxygen. These two people.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't know
if there were military

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:90%
or they were just civilians or--

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: The two individuals.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so they decided
they had to get out of there.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
pilot their thing,

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:90%
their sled to get out of there.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And once they were
out of there and back,

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:84%
the cameras didn't take
any pictures either

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
because they panicked
and because they

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
were feeling strange
and they thought they

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:90%
were being deprived of oxygen.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Hypoxia.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Hypoxia.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You said they went
in and there was this emanation

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Did it have a
source or is this--

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
you said there's light
in there of some sort.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: As they drove into this
dome, the entrance is small,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
just like the entrance
in that tunnel.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But then they came
into this vast dome,

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and
hundreds of feet high

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
and having all these pictures.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And they looked all
around and every place

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:84%
they could look at, they saw
this holographic depiction

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial,
gray looking down at them

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:84%
or a picture of a picture of
scenery of someplace else, which

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
they are assuming
to be their planet,

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
because some of these
holographic images

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't appear to be Earth.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And the lights, they
couldn't determine

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:90%
where the lights came from.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:84%
When they were debriefed
later, they said,

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:84%
you know what, it
was just lit all

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.023 align:middle line:84%
over but we couldn't determine
where these lights were.

00:23:32.023 --> 00:23:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course,
they panicked

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
because they thought they
were going to hypoxia

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and they got out of there.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is rumored-- and I
don't know this for a fact--

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
is they sent more
teams down there later.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, I know for a fact
this incident happened as far as

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:84%
whether they sent other
teams down there as rumors

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:90%
from another person.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When they were
looking at the pictures

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrials, you
said it looked like they were

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
looking back.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, these
two, in their report,

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
in their testimony, when
they looked up and saw this

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial gray, it
was as if it was alive,

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:90%
looking back at them.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
It was all scary to
them because they

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:84%
thought that they
were in some chamber

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:84%
with these extraterrestrials
looking down at them.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:84%
But the more they looked
through this holographic image,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
they realized it was
just maybe a picture

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:90%
of an extraterrestrial.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Richard, we have
covered so much information

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
on this topic that we're
going to have to continue it

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:90%
on another episode.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.227 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I look forward
to that next episode.

00:24:42.227 --> 00:24:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I do, too.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being on the show.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: You're very welcome.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
