>> Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we're with Tim,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:10%
who is speaking with
us today from Germany.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes,
anticipates, and suggests

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:10%
various strategies connected
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.368 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned that
extraterrestrials are

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:90%
interacting with humans.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell us
about ETs among us?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So I wasn't involved with
detecting non-terrestrial

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:84%
beings among humanoid
people or Terran people.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It was always my job to
communicate, to make contact,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to analyze data, and
to then give advice

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:84%
on how species can interact
for a mutual benefit.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But the most non-terrestrial
beings we have on this planet

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
are mostly non-humanoid genetic
modifications or hybrids.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And also, high
interfrequential beings that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
reintegrate or
reincarnate into society.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Some say that there are human
extraterrestrials all amongst

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
us, in the political government,
in the higher agencies,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It could be our neighbor,
for all we know.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>> There are non-terrestrial
beings that do look like

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
humans, and they
work hand in hand.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But those beings know
why they are here,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and they got the
proper paperwork

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
and they got invited, so to
speak, to work on the surface.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
two other types

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of lifeforms that could
be of this definition,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
because we either have hybrid,
hybridized humans, which

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
means they try to
connect certain species

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:90%
They got born here.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:90%
They grow up as humans.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But in most cases, the
non-terrestrial beings

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
make sure that they know
where they come from.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:90%
They got some direction.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:90%
They got open contact.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And the other type
of non-terrestrials

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that do sort of
merge into society

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
are beings that come
back to this experience

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
because they already
ascended in a different way,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:90%
in a different universe.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And they come back to
help the Earth transcend

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and to stabilize the overall
evolution of the universe.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:10%
Those are beings that
certainly or sometimes get

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:10%
lost in the process, because
reincarnation has some risks

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:10%
to get too involved with
what you are experiencing,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:10%
and not remembering that you
are coming from somewhere else.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And for sure, some
hybrids are just

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
doing normal, day-to-day
work because they might not

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:90%
remember they are hybrids.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
They might not
remember they're coming

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
with a specific task in
mind to, for example,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
elevate human consciousness
or do something beneficial.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And dare I say,
the human society

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
has a very strict way
of navigating people

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:90%
through the tasks of society.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:90%
You get into school.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
You get in university,
day-to-day job.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of a karma
of the planetary system.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a way to recognize
the extraterrestrials amongst

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:90%
us?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Because some of
them look like us.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
You said some of
them are hybrids.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do this?

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> This is not too easy.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Because mostly, they do look
like human, Terran people.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
want to find out

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
if somebody is a hybrid, if
you don't have technologies,

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
the best way to
find out about it

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
is how you feel
in their presence.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So mostly, more experienced
and non-human people

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:90%
feel differently, in a way.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So it can be that
you really like

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to be around somebody
because it feels at ease.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Those beings are mostly
very intelligent.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be a little
off-placed, in a way.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just, in some way, very
pleasantly to be around them.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's a funny
story, because when

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
this question, I one time

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:90%
was confused by somebody.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:10%
Because I was somewhere and
then somebody came up to me,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:10%
and we were talking.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me
something about his group,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and he was telling me
something that he has "gained,"

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and this is a quote, a
certain amount of credits.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And asked me how many
credits did I obtain.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
like, yeah, he's

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
pretty much misunderstanding or
confusing myself with somebody

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:90%
from his own group.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, to
non-terrestrial beings,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
it's just as hard as
for terrestrial beings.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And this was also
the first occasion--

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I learned later on
that this type of being

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
was trying to get his
hands on galactic credits.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
first time for me

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to hear about galactic
credits, which

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a monetary
system in the universe.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was confusing myself
with somebody from his group.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Which is, by the way,
heavily gold based.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody needs
to invest something,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:90%
then this would be a tip.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned, Tim, and
gave us a great example for us

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
to find out if they're a hybrid.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:10%
But you also mentioned a way
to do it through technology.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:10%
Could you explain that?

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:10%
Through what technology?

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You can sense it
if it's strong enough,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:84%
or you can use technology just
to find out exact data about

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:90%
this frequency.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Or you can also
do a certain test

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and get the DNA
information about that.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So these devices measure
genetic frequencies.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> They measure the frequency
and the way a being radiates

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
a certain tone, a
certain pattern.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Would you say it's a
type of programming

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:90%
that they're doing to us?

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a dangerous
question, Emery.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you something.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the overall
nature of the universe

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
is caring and loving?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the
probabilities of a loving

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and self-caring universe gets
higher if the universe is all

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:90%
one?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:10%
So if you're watching this
society and Earth people,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:10%
there is an installation
that causes fear.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:10%
And fear is
something that can be

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:10%
used as a defensive
mechanism, but it also

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:10%
can be used to minor the
probabilities of a evolution.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:10%
So this is something that it's
really tough to get rid of,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.390 align:middle line:10%
because people that have
a fear-based mindset

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:10%
tend to reject any kind of
information they've been given.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So we need to really carefully
and gently maneuver and guide

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
around this to liberate the
human mind and the human system

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:84%
The people need to come
back to the mindset

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that the overall
nature of the universe

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is potentially beneficial
and protective.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, do you think
there's a plan, an agenda,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:84%
set up for humanity to
actually get to that level

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to my moral
and ethical standpoint,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I would enjoy just to see
people speak about certain

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
installations and
to ease their minds.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the universe has
a kind of self-responsibility

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to not become a xenophobe
and full of angst.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But they're making evil
extraterrestrial movies every

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
month, and it's kind of like
a type of programming to scare

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There's even
theories of, there's

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:84%
going to be an evil alien
invasion of some sort.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:10%
>> As a tactical advisor,
we are always looking

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:10%
for self-sufficiency or
self-prophecies that come true.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:10%
So when you think
about angst, this

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:10%
is something that gets worse
the more you experience it.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:10%
So the only way to handle
with this is to kind of move

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:10%
through it.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Does that mean some
of the people in some

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:10%
of the population here are not
going to be able to go through

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:10%
it?

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:10%


00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:10%
>> So I wouldn't say so,
because there's a free will

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:10%
to everybody.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And everybody can just sort
of create its own destiny.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is something the
universe really, really wants

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:90%
its lifeforms to do.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end,
the overall goal

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.720 align:middle line:84%
we all have is to create
home for ourselves,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's a natural recycling
process within the universe

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I'm saying, we're
forever beings and here we are

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
having war and all this
disease and famine.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And like you said,
it's something

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:90%
we have to move through.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that many
of us have volunteered

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
to come back to maybe
educate the planet,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:90%
maybe become a leader.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking
me if there's

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:84%
a universal component to
what is happening right now,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
then I would say
that the planet has

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
sort of a natural, universal
evolutionary mechanism,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
so it's heading towards a
field of higher frequency.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And within this
frequency, the reality

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:84%
we share in this
dimension, on this planet,

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
as a planetary consciousness
is going to lift up.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It's altering a
lot, immersively.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
We come to the acknowledgment
that everything is possible,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that we are the creators
of our own lives.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But we are also responsible
for being connected with group

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and we're also
collectively working together

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:90%
for mutual benefit.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So everyone who agrees
to this, there's

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
certainly a room
or a place, a home,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
whatever, in this universe,
to interact with this process.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people say, Tim,
that ETs are benevolent

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:90%
and positive.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there are others
out there that say, no, there

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:90%
are negative ones as well.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you believe in?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Emery, at this
point and at this time,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
at this nexus where we are,
we're experiencing a dualistic

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:90%
world view.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing things
apart from ourselves.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is typically
something that

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:84%
occurs in the third frequential
harmonic, where Earth

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:90%
has been for years and decades.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And this means that
people are thinking

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%
about differences a lot.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have to argue a lot
about how to get things

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:90%
to a point of agreement.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is not the way the
universe was designed for,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's not the
way the universe

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and the groundbreaking
majority of beings

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and life forms is acting
and behaving towards itself.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're thinking
higher, so to speak,

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
more experienced-level
beings, from level 4

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
upwards to level 12, those
beings are very benevolent

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and they try to raise global
consciousness pretty much

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:90%
all day long.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
types of beings

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that, they do have
their own agendas.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is pretty
normal to the experience

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:90%
of dualistic worldview.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you saying that there
are extraterrestrials and humans

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
that are stuck in this dualistic
state of mind, I'll say?

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Less and less, Emery,
because at this point,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
the universe is
evolving constantly.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And while we were inside of
a third-frequency experience,

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
which means we see each
other apart from each other,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:84%
dualistically, as
you say, we're now

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
heading towards a
fourth-level experience.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And once this is a perfect
fourth-level experience,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:84%
we have an idea that
the universe is all one.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Interesting enough,
in German, we say--

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the word you have for "all"
is our word for the universe.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:90%
We say "All."

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It means everything.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So the more evolved
species get and the more

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
evolved and the more time
and experience we have,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
we come to the conclusion
that you are a creator,

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:17.177 align:middle line:84%
I'm a creator, and the creator
itself is all around us.

00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great way to put it.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
In all my travels
around the planet,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I always studied different
types of civilizations.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:10%
And how nice would it be if
everyone understood that you're

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:10%
talking to yourself?

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> We are, Emery.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.645 align:middle line:90%
We are talking to ourselves.

00:15:32.645 --> 00:15:33.445 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLES]

00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> That doesn't
mean, necessarily,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:90%
we're all the same.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No, right.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the universe
needs diversity,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the
fundamental reasons why

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:90%
disclosure is so necessary.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we certainly have
not solved all the problems

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
we had in the level three
experience, like pollution

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.700 align:middle line:90%
and arguing and stuff.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
What the universe is doing, it
is expanding its possibilities.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are more best
practices out there

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that can be reintegrated
in ourselves.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for the
fourth-level experience

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:84%
we are now making is
just to get it right.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the definition
of the fourth density?

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're talking
frequential harmonics.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And frequential harmonics
means that to every life

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:84%
form, there's a specific
tone, a vibrancy, so to speak,

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
which is basically set up on
by experience and by the way

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
has found a solution

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
to certain questions, universal
questions, cosmic questions.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And within this
process, the life form

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
gets elevated in its cosmic
consciousness, so to speak.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about frequential harmonics

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
"3D," it's not a dimension,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
because dimension--
it is a dimension,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
but we should not confuse
frequential harmonics

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:90%
with dimensions.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Because in the third
frequential harmonics,

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:90%
we do have a component of space.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:90%
We're all sharing certain space.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You and me, we
are sharing space.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:90%
A virtual space, in this case.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But in some way, we're both
sharing the same space.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So the concept of frequencies
means that every life form

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
has a certain type
of frequency and is

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
specific to this
frequency as a subject

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and as a group
consciousness, so to speak.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So this planet Earth was in
a level-three consciousness,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
which means that we
have linear physics.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:90%
We have linear time.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
We have dualistic thinking.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, the technology
is level-three technology,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
which means we need to blow
things apart to mine a hole,

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And while we're now lifting
the frequential harmonics

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and
this is something

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that happens naturally through
the course of evolution

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, we're
now heading a phase

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:84%
of the universe or our reality
where everything can happen.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.690 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
non-linear physics.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.520 align:middle line:90%
We're talking quantum physics.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:90%
We're talking mind transmission.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We have technology that can
easily and noninvasively build

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
structures, move
objects for, I don't

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
know, building a
pyramid or something.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So everything is possible when
we're in this kind of mindset.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And how long do you think
it'll take us to get there,

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
in a 3D timeline?

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The 3D timeline, it's
happening now, right now.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So we must distinguish
between a individual that

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
can have a certain frequency.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:10%
This planet we're on is
capable of housing life forms

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:10%
up to level-four consciousness.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So that means when you're
thinking of, I don't know,

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
yogis from India
that are levitating,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
this is certainly a
level-four life form,

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
because it has realized its own
potential, which is infinite,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And we also need to
take into consideration

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that the overall consciousness,
group consciousness,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
is also something that
determines what kind

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:84%
of frequential
harmonics we're in.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we have seen when
we were investigating those

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
yogis that are not
eating something,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that are levitating something--
those yogis can do it in India,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:84%
but they cannot
perform it in Germany.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:10%
Because the vital energy,
the consciousness,

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.345 align:middle line:10%
group consciousness
of people is--

00:20:19.345 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:10%
was, has been, more
into third-dimension or

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:10%
third-frequency
harmonics than into

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:10%
fourth frequential harmonics.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> What a great answer.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of our
guests have mentioned

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that we are under some
sort of quarantine,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:84%
some sort of embargo,
by extraterrestrials.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the best
way to describe it

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
is as a kind of
natural mechanism

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to the overall evolution
of the universe.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So the planet itself,
which used to have

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
a level-three
consciousness or was inside

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of third-level
frequential harmonics, got

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
sealed, in a way, by some
higher experienced lifeforms.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Because what they
wanted to achieve

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is to keep most influences
outside of the system

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:84%
so that the free will of
every human being is granted

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and everyone can
decide for their own

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
if they want to believe linear
reality or more open-mindedly

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
accept the infinite
possibilities

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:90%
of quantum physics, for example.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not that we are under
quarantine by an aggressive

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial race, is
what you're telling me?

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> At this very point of time,
the Earth defense has set up

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of hardware, so to speak,
to protect the planet from

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:90%
outside influence.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And this means that even
non-terrestrial beings

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that were openly flying around
Earth's air space some decades

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
ago, they understand
that it's forbidden now

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:90%
to enter without proper papers.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking
about frequential harmonics,

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
it's more a natural
mechanism, defense mechanism,

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And while this planet is moving
ahead into higher-frequency

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
area fields of the
universe, this barrier--

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's open.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people believe that
the extraterrestrials inhabit

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
our oceans, they
inhabit our forests.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I think not much,
Emery, because this is only

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:90%
second-hand information to me.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's
a lot of observation

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:84%
around certain
species in the oceans

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that was brought into
the Earth system.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, it's
to make experience,

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
very special about Earth.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's that here
on this planet,

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the Earth, we have

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:84%
lots and lots of animals,
lots of different types of,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I've got to say races.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Human breeds are very
different to each other,

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:84%
so they can make a
lot of experience

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
with interacting
with each other.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Most planets of the solar
system tend to not have.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
They have a more restricted
kind of lineage to their DNA.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I agree completely.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us an example
of the aquatic types

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.670 align:middle line:90%
that you're referring to?

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Is "octopus" the
right word in English?

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right?

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
second-hand information.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not one of the information
I was typically working with.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:10%
But if we are looking,
for example, at octopus,

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:10%
then we can see
that those beings,

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:10%
they were brought
into the system,

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:10%
just to experience and
to evolve on Earth.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> How about the
ones in the forest?

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is
second-hand information,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
but when we get talking about
certain reports of Bigfoot,

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:90%
for example--

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
so this is one of the
animals that seem to exist,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
even though I haven't
met them, seen them.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Probably you have more
experience on that, Emery.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, I do.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.302 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:25:08.302 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you know of any
that live underground?

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, Emery, nothing I've
got too much information on.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:10%
But there seem to be a lot
of different civilizations

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:10%
that live underground
because it's safer,

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:10%
and the planet has gone
through one or two catalysts

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:10%
very heavily, like a flood.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And people just went underground
and developed from there.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:84%
They had the
specification that they

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
could develop a more unique,
more homogeneous way.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have too
much influence from outside

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:84%
as those species on
the surface have.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:10%
So they tend to have developed
more sophisticatedly.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:10%
They have more
experience in some ways.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But they also seem to not have
the high evolutionary potential

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that species have that
experience a lot of tension,

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
like surface humans
do every day.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they humans that
are living underground,

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:90%
or they're extraterrestrials?

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And do they come to the
surface and interact

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:90%
with the regular humans?

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So to my knowledge, the
ancient civilizations that

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:84%
lived on the surface of
the planet were met with

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
a disastrous flood at some
time of human history.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And those humans went
down inside of the Earth,

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:90%
or into big, big, huge graves.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:84%
There is another
type of life form

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:84%
that is well-presented
in ancient mythology

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and in ancient history.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
second-hand information.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So those are some kind
of ant-type beings.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were pretty
helpful in the way

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
they rescued a lot of humans
when the flood appeared

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the
Earth thousands of years

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
ago with some kind
of ant-like species.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You spoke about many
extraterrestrial types

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.530 align:middle line:84%
during this interview and
how they are connecting

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:90%
with other agencies out there.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:84%
How do we connect to
our galactic families

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:90%
as individuals?

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a beautiful question.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:84%
We're actually not only
one intergalactic family,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
but we are all the same life.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same living being.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And the overwhelming
mass of the universe

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:84%
is driving towards friendship
and interconnectiveness

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and cooperation for
a mutual benefit.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So if I have one advice to the
audience, it's make friends.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:10%
The dysfunctional
aspects of the universe

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.030 align:middle line:10%
that are still involved
in this experience

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.230 align:middle line:10%
of the dualistic level-three
consciousness, that

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:10%
is something that
needs to be dealt with.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But we have a lot
of, as you say,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic friends and
opportunities to do so.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So be self-confident
that there is

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:55.380 align:middle line:84%
a hyper-intelligent mechanism
to the overall structure

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
that is protective,

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:90%
that is beneficial to itself.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, use your
own powers as a creator.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Speak it into existence.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:16.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, make room
for friendly contact now.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Or as I have said earlier, happy
Earth shift, positively now.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
the universe longs for.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can bet that,
surprisingly, things

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:90%
