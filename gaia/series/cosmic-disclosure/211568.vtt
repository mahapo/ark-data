>> Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we are with Tim,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor to covert
analyst trying to understand

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:10%
the missions and strategies of
non-human intelligences here

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
on Earth.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, we talked a lot
about the hybrid program here

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.965 align:middle line:84%
Could you please explain what
is the Immersion Program?

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we have three
types of non-terrestrials

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
interacting with humanity
right now, which is basically,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
A, people that got
integrated, reintegrated,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:90%
reincarnated on this planet.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And B, hybrids, which are born
beings on this planet that

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:90%
have a cohesive experience.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have C, which is
the Immersion Program,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and this is basically
empty vessels

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that are being placed
on this very planet

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and are being controlled from
outside from a ship or a base

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.465 align:middle line:84%
or something outside
of the planet.

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:24.635 align:middle line:90%
>> How are they controlled?

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's like one of your
favorite Hollywood movies where

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.525 align:middle line:84%
someone is basically putting
his original body into a tube,

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%
a container, or something.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And his neurons and the
brain, the actual brain,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
gets connected via some
technology with an empty vessel

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and its brain.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So basically, someone in a tube
outside of the planet on a ship

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even on a
different other planet

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
where the capacities are
large enough and good enough

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
can operate a humanoid
figure on this planet

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.254 align:middle line:90%
in a absolutely immersive way.

00:02:10.254 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>> How is this different
than the non-soul humans?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not that different.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we've seen that
ETs can use non-soul humans

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:90%
for this purpose.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty easy to do so for
them because those are empty,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:90%
non-inhabited so to speak.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But most species that use
these immersion programs,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
like for example, the
Greys, they usually grow

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
humanoid figures,
bodies artificially

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.395 align:middle line:84%
so they can better integrate
themselves into them.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:46.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you explain a little
bit more about this technology?

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's basically a
technology that you put

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
your own natural biological
being, body into that.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:90%
You have a nutritional liquid.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
For some species,
the Greys do not

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
need that because they
have a different system.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But there are more
than one species

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:84%
that uses the same
technology, and some of them

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:90%
have biological bodies.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:90%
They need food.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
They need to digest basically.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:90%
They need liquid.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And they also need
some movements

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
because you could basically stay
in this tube for months, even

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, biological body
cannot hold a position for too

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So basically, those
containers then

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
make sure that
the body is moved,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
the original body is moved
so that it doesn't break.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>> When you get transferred
from the pod to, let's say,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
a vessel, does the being's
soul and spirit go with that,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:90%
to that new vessel?

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not necessarily.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So the actual body
stays in the ship.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The soul container is
what we call the soul.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
This is operating from a
different higher frequential

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
plane, basically, a level 6
consciousness outside of time,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is non-localized--

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
still connected to a
localized form, of course.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But the whole experience
is 100% immersive,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
which means that the person,
the ET that uses this technology

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is 100% solved in that
unique experience.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
They 100% perceive
their surroundings

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
through the emotions and
the neurological features

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:90%
of that human body, for example.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> If something were to
happen to the vessel--

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and does anything happen to the
3D body, like an injury, death?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, phantom
pain would happen.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So basically if the vessel
loses an arm, for example,

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and the awareness in
that vessel suddenly gets

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
rejected, and the
person awakes in the pod

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
then it might feel for one
or two days that his arm got

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:90%
sloughed off or something.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
They would feel it
through their own brain

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
in their own
neurological system.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's a phantom pain
that would basically occur.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the purpose
of these immersion pods?

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, depends on
who's using them.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But what we see is
that, mostly, species

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
use them in order
to make contact,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.175 align:middle line:84%
which is a quite
peaceful approach to it.

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
They have realized that
it's much easier when

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
you appear to be human to get
in contact with other humans,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of using their original
form and their original body.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Those bodies are
actually 100% adaptive

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to their specific environment,
which means, on Earth,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
you do not need to care about
certain microbes, viruses,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
or even the environment--
the biological and natural

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:90%
environment at all.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Makes it very,
very convenient.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Makes it super
convenient, yes.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, some are using
it as a technology

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to disguise, and to covertly
interact, or do something.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:90%
So you could, basically, use--

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
if you have the right
genetics, you could basically

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
create a clone of your own
best friends, or something,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
and use that as a vessel.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So you could get
very close to someone

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
without them realizing it.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The extraterrestrial
that's using a human body,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is this something that's
short-term or his whole life?

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be used for a
short-term interaction.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
this situation

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:84%
where an ET intelligence used
some non-soul humans in order

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
to make contact with me and
a group of friends of mine.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So in general, those
vessels are being used

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:90%
for 20, 30 years, or something.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
They could also use it
for an entire lifespan

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of a human being,
which is basically

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:90%
around 70 years or something.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the mission.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on what the
ET wants to accomplish.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And some ETs are only interested
in specific human experiences,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:90%
which is mating, love.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Having parents is something that
is super interesting to them

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
because, look, the Greys don't
reproduce in a natural way.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They do not have
a mom and a dad.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
gain this experience

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
through fully and 100% immersive
experiences of being human.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the vessel know once the
extraterrestrial returns back

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:90%
to the pod?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.125 align:middle line:90%
Does that being recall?

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.736 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The body itself can
only be operated as long

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
as there is an awareness inside
of him, or her, or whatever.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So basically, once
immersion ends,

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:84%
basically, the body just falls
to the ground and would die.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So could you and I be in
an immersion pod right now?

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we could.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And we wouldn't
potentially know about it

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.745 align:middle line:84%
because most of the
experiences-- well,

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:84%
the ETs could make you
aware that you are inside

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:90%
of this technology.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
The big risk of it is to
lose the connection, which

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
is basically similar
to, for example,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
a dream, when you realize
you're inside of a dream.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And that dream gets destabilized
through that awareness.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And you suddenly wake up.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So basically, once someone
comes to a full understanding

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and awareness of being
inside of a tube,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that means that your actual
brain has lost its connection

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:90%
to the vessel.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you basically
snap out of it,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:84%
probably have a really heavy
experience with waking up,

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
which for a human using
this apparatus would take

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:84%
one, two, three days until you
fully get your sense of reality

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And you might react with--
your actual body might

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
react with fever and
dizziness, which isn't

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:90%
the case with some other ETs.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys, for example,
they have this immersive hut,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
like a cloud system or
something around the universe.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So they, basically--
because they are always

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:84%
living in some kind of
immersion technology,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
this is basically their
whole life experience

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that they use 3D-printed
bodies and get their awareness

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:90%
into them.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
They don't have this super
hot experience of waking up.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> When the extraterrestrial
in the pod is finished with his

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
mission, let's say, what
happens to that vessel?

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Does it die?

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And how different is
that than ordinary death?

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's similar but different
in that way as, yes,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
it dies once the consciousness
is being removed from this

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:90%
vessel.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like removing the
actual life force out of it.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You could reuse that vessel
because it's basically

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:90%
a non-soul human then.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's an empty
vessel that could be

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
upgraded with another
consciousness again.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
those vessels just die.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And what's the difference
between the natural biological

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
death and this death?

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that
the awareness then

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
awakes in a different
situation, again.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
living its life, again.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
lifespan of Greys

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
can be in the
thousands of years.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you're
staying 70 years

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
on this planet to make an
immersive experience is just

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
a few percentage of
their own lifespan.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So they can go on
after that and live on.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So the natural
occurring death would

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
mean that your awareness
and your energy

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:90%
just leaves the body.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%
The body dies.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And your awareness gets
re-filtered and reused

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.520 align:middle line:84%
by the natural patterns
that the universe has.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But that is a pretty
unconscious experience.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Only if you're very
trained and you

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
know how to maneuver
through death,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
then you can bring your
awareness, your energy

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to someplace that
you want to be.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
you're just moving

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
through the natural recycled
program of the universe, which

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:90%
is unconscious.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:90%
And then you get reintegrated.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:90%
You lose your memory, of course.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And then you're reintegrated
into some other scenario.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Tim, let's talk
about the extraterrestrial

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:90%
that's in the pod.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:90%
He left the vessel.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Does his memory
come with him back?

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And also emotional stress and
traumatic emotional stuff,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
does that also come
back when they wake up?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the big
benefits to this technology

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that everything you
experienced in your vessel

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.570 align:middle line:84%
is 100% immersive to
your own experience.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when you
go through something

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that lifts your own soul
and your own character--

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
for example, having a baby.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:84%
This can be a
transformational process

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:90%
for the person who has it.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you have,
for example, a Grey,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
they would naturally
never have this experience

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
of being connected to
another being or something

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
because they do not
naturally reproduce.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:10%
So if there is a Grey that has--

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:10%
suddenly giving birth to human
baby through its own vessel,

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:10%
this experience is 100% real
to the being, to the ET.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And whatever consequences,
or whatever feeling

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.950 align:middle line:84%
of connectivity, of love,
of cherishing another being,

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
or something comes with that,
this is 100% true to the being

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So when they wake
up in that pod,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:84%
they still have that
emotional feeling.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:90%
This is 100% true.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
This is not like a dream
that fades very quickly.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:90%
It stays with you.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And it changes your
soul and your character.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have to have the same
gender for those beings that

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:90%
do--

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>> So a male can go to a female.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And we've seen that.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So some other
species-- again, this

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
is a technology that's been
used not only by the Greys,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:84%
but different other species
are using it as well.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
species do not have

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:84%
an interest in making contact
scenarios or something.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
They use it as only
for the experience

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and only for experiencing
something out of fun.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So if they like
the idea of being

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
a female and have fun with that,
they can definitely do that.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any governments or
agencies here on Earth that are

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
utilizing this technology?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how are
they utilizing it?

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> As much as I am
informed, yes, there are.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
There are very rare
situations where

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
this technology is being
used because, I think,

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:90%
it's not as perfected.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's
very rarely used

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's still in some
kind of development phase.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
While the Greys have this
enormous cloud internet

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
thing going on
throughout the universe,

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.880 align:middle line:84%
they can basically
operate a vessel

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:90%
through an enormous distance.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:90%
So they could use it.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And they could be somewhere
in Orion or something.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is 60 light years away.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:90%
But they still can use it.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And they still have
this connection.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost even
instantly that they use it.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And they have no lack at all.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
The way I understand
it, the human program,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that is top class
technology right now.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It has certain
challenges with the lack,

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and the distance--
the proximity.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happened to the ET
in the pod if he were to die?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very rare that
people like ETs die

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because there's a medical team
or a team that observes all

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%
these beings in these tubes.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:90%
They are const--

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What if the craft just
exploded or something happened?

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, like that?

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that would instantly
lose the connection between

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.248 align:middle line:90%
the vessel and the beings.

00:15:59.248 --> 00:16:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>> So the vessel, what happens?

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Do they fall on the ground or--

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It would fall down on the
ground and would be basically

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:90%
dead.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Tragic.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
What are the reasons for
using a human vessel instead

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
of their own
extraterrestrial vessel

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
when they're trying
to make contact?

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There are reasons for
that, which has to do with

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
the similar behavior and
appearance of these vessels.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.700 align:middle line:90%
They look human.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically, pretty easy.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The beings themselves
are pretty well

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.720 align:middle line:84%
integrated and prepared for the
environment they are used in.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're using something
on a different planet that

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
has a different atmosphere,
and a different pressure,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and humans, for example,
or different ETs

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:84%
could not survive there, if they
use the vessels of that species

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
that lives on that
planet and is perfectly

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
fit to that environment,
they are perfectly fit to it.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So there are some reasons
for using that technology,

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
for gaining that specific
experience in a very real sense

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
while being safe
at the same time.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
Because even if they die,
they get back to the ship

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and live on whatever
time span they live.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:90%
So these are the reasons.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
Other reasons for
choosing a hybrid--

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
which has its own
complications to it.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Hybrids could get lost
in their own incarnation.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
They could forget
that they are hybrids.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:84%
They could get lost in a way
that they lose track of them.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But it also brings some
benefits because everyone

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
who's born on this
planet has a certain set

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of rights in a cosmological
universal sense.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So basically, someone who's
only using a vessel in order

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to appear human is,
basically, still an alien.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And someone who's
born on this planet

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:90%
is basically an earthling.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:90%
So there's this difference.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is the difference
between reincarnation

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
and the immersion pods?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Reincarnation is
a natural process.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us always
reincarnate somewhere

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:90%
at some times.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation process
has some challenges

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:84%
to it as well, some
non-controllable moments.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
You could very easily
get lost in existence.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And we see that happen to
a lot of reincarnated souls

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that they just feel not
at home on this planet.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't
realized they might

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
have come from
somewhere else in order

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:84%
to shift this experience
on this planet.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
biggest challenges that

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
could come to someone
who's reintegrating itself

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.460 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Also all the experiences you
have as a reincarnated soul,

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.965 align:middle line:90%
they might be fatal in that way.

00:19:02.965 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:90%
When you die, you're dead.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:84%
You're not waking
up somewhere else.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But your soul gets
reincarnated and gets back

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
in this natural recycling
process that the universe has.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So again, there are
pros and cons to that.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the pros--
and that is why

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of higher
frequential beings

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
still use reincarnation
methods is

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that you are directly
connected to the consciousness

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:90%
field of the group.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when you
are here on a mission

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize the frequency-- the
frequential field of the Earth,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
when you reincarnate
it as an earthling,

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
basically, you
are 100% connected

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:84%
with the energetical
consciousness field of Earth.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
While when you're only a
visitor to this Earth--

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to this world, you can
still have an impact

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:90%
by doing physical actions.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But you're not part of
the collective field.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What's more effective,
using the immersion pods

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
or an extraterrestrial
that could shapeshift?

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I would say--

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
so the shapeshifting-- and I
had the pleasure, so to speak,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
to connect with a being
that was doing that.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:90%
That is a psionic field.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that they project outside

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
with their own psionic features,
their own powers they have,

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:90%
their mind powers basically.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And this cannot be
hold up for too long.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So basically, once someone is
inside of this Earth field,

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:84%
psionic features and psionic
skills are limited by a lot.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:90%
So basically, when someone--

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
a species that has this ability
is on a different planet

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
or something where you don't
have this heavy reality

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
field that we have
on this planet,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
they could, for
example, project out

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
their appearance for
months and months

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
until they need to
recover from that,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
take a little nap or something,
and eventually get back

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:90%
into form.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But on Earth, it's the
way that you can only

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:84%
hold that appearance for a
few days, maybe some hours

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:90%
until they get tired.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they need to
get back to their base,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to their mothership, or wherever
they have the opportunity

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to recover from that
exercise they are doing.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you're using a vessel,
this is basically form-stable.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
It's stable to its form
for 70 years, basically.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:84%
You can go on, and
on, and on, and on.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now on planet
Earth, are there more

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials using the
immersion pods, shapeshifting,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:90%
the psionic holographic imaging?

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We're probably talking about
hundreds of thousands of hybrid

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:90%
people on this planet.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
We're probably talking about
millions of reincarnated souls.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're probably only
talking about a few hundreds

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:90%
of those immersion people.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And which ones are best
utilized for which kind

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:90%
of missions?

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it depends.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if you
want your own soul

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to experience something in
order to grow then, of course,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:84%
you go for an immersion
pod because you

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
have 100% real authentic
experience that your soul can

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.720 align:middle line:90%
benefit from.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you are basically
interested in influencing

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
foreign species then
a hybrid program

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
would be the right thing to
do because these beings are

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.120 align:middle line:84%
a direct mixture
of both species.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
If you already made this
wonderful experience

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that you're more
than an I experience

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and that you are aware of,
you can go back and forth

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
through the natural
patterns of reincarnation,

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
this is the choice for most
higher frequential beings.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:90%
They do not use technology.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:84%
They rely upon the
natural patterns

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:84%
that they have learned to
modify through their own psionic

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
features.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the experience,
and that this is not

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the capability of projecting
out this holo form then,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
potentially, you're
going to use that.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But this is not like
a lot of species

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:90%
that are capable of doing so.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And it still needs a lot of
energy to hold up that form.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is, basically,
something for a covert mission

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:90%
of a few weeks maybe.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, have you ever seen
an immersion pod in action?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I am aware of
this technology.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I'm aware that
the Greys are using it

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:84%
even for visiting different
other planes of reality.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I have seen it.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> How have you seen it?

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've seen it
on a craft from the--

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:90%
that the Greys were using.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So they, basically,
had these tubes

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that they were using, basically,
for connecting their--

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
this reality, this
experienceable universe

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:84%
with a different version
of the universe, which

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is basically,
actually not connected

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:90%
to this universe at all.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
connected through

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:90%
a non-logical connectivity.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different version of
what we would call universe.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is something where
the Greys are currently

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:90%
exploring life.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And it brings a lot
of challenges to them

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
because the definition of what
life is in a physical form

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist there.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So you basically have a
very small amount of time

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:84%
until you lose your
own bodily form,

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
until you lose yourself in
existence in this kind of very

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:90%
chaotic universe.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It still holds life.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So they are basically using
their technology there in order

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:90%
to explore this.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.152 align:middle line:84%
>> You said you've
seen it on a craft.

00:25:27.152 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Have you been in
one of the crafts?

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen some of the
craft, yes, from the inside.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And what exactly did the
immersion pod look like?

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It's tubes.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
They are utilizing
pretty high tubes

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:84%
filled with a liquid where they,
basically, put people inside

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And the liquid itself seems
to fulfill healing purposes,

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
but as well as stabilizing
the position of the body,

00:25:54.860 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and giving nutritions, I
guess, to the body as well.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What were you doing on the
craft there in the first place?

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been an
exploring mission.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So while we've done
this contact work,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
we've also seen some
of that technology

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.263 align:middle line:90%
and some of the crafts.

00:26:12.263 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>> And these were the Greys?

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you please describe
the experience you had

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:90%
on the craft?

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>> So it wasn't a flying craft.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's, basically, visiting
any other piece of technology

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:90%
that's been stored.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically a
roundish, disk-like object

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:90%
that you can enter.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
impressions that I had

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:84%
was that everything is super
smooth, seamlessly made.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's no dirt,
which is weird too.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's also no
direct light source

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:84%
while everything is illuminated,
which is wondrous in that way.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you in your
3D body or astral?

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And where did
this take place?

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The same
communication scenario,

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:84%
the same facility where the
communication itself took

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Where was the craft?

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Was it here on
Earth or in space?

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I've not been in space.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:90%
So it was on the ground.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, could you describe
for us your visual account

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
of getting onto the craft,
maybe the scents you smelled,

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit more detailed.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've not
smelled too much.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I would say the only
thing that I think

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I smelled was a metal smell.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything felt pretty light.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The whole material inside
of it was seamlessly--

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:90%
it was shiny.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It felt light in
a way that I don't

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%
know if you could pick it up.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:84%
It would definitely be lighter
than the perception of it.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The craft itself had one
section where you find something

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that I would identify as a
display or something, which

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.130 align:middle line:84%
is where the Greys place
their puppet bodies.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:90%
They have stools there, chairs.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:84%
There was a kind
of bed, something

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
where you could
lay a body onto it,

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
probably something that
people know from their contact

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.300 align:middle line:84%
scenarios when they've got
these examinations and stuff.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have a pillow, which
I found pretty interesting.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it flat?

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.615 align:middle line:84%
>> It was absolutely flat
until the head, which was--

00:28:24.615 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:84%
the head space was like
a hole almost where

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
you could rest your
head into that.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
inverted to the experience

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that humans have where they
put a pillow upon something.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It was like, you put
head down into it.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Other than that,
it was super clean,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
which is super
interesting so not a grain

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:90%
of dust or something on that.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Then were there other
beings in there with you?

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Other beings?

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.990 align:middle line:90%
No, actually.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, most of the time, no.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
When we examined
those immersion pods,

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I guess, two of the
beings were on the craft.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know how long
they were in those pods?

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:90%
They weren't in the pods.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
They were, actually,
just those puppet bodies.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were
operating on the craft

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and showing people
around, I guess.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Were these craft
fully functional?

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I assume so.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a craft that's
been placed there by the Greys

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:90%
and not being brought there.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>> How many meters
was it across?

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say, potentially,
maybe 20m, 15m, or something.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And what about the height?

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't huge in a way that
it could carry a whole team

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.040 align:middle line:90%
of people or something.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:84%
That would be
something that I would

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
assume that those kind of crafts
are like huge or something.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't that small either.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So I would say three
humans could very well live

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:84%
in that space, like, a
hotel room or something

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
from that dimensions
if that makes sense.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know how
they flew the craft?

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Was there controls?

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Or was it just telepathy?

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There were those
little baby stools,

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:90%
baby chairs that you have.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the Grey would
put their body into that.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if they put
their hands on something.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But this is basically the
operation corner of the craft.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you
feel, emotionally,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:84%
being on this craft
for the first time?

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than the experiences
that I had with the beings,

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:84%
which were intense
and traumatizing,

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that I felt any
presence in the craft itself.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:84%
What I found really distinct
and really fascinating

00:30:54.770 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
was this futuristic design
that seemed that everything

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:90%
was so seamless.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:84%
There's something--
it's so smooth.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's attractive.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
that's a wild thought.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But it feels like you want
to touch it because it's

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:90%
so smooth in that way.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
I found super interesting.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> What color was it?

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Very light metalish color,
super light, Grey metallic.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there any lit screens
or control panels at all?

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, nothing that
was currently working.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But you could see that--head of
these little chairs that they

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:41.930 align:middle line:84%
had, that this was basically
a monitor or a huge-curved

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.373 align:middle line:90%
display.

00:31:43.373 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> How many times have
you been on that craft?

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Only a few times, I don't
know, three, four times,

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were you
going on the craft?

00:31:51.878 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Was it a meeting, a mission?

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:84%
We basically had questions
about technology, again,

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.470 align:middle line:84%
which was normal
because the Greys are

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.980 align:middle line:84%
doing contracts and selling
their own technology.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So we went through
that, looked at it--

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What did you
end up purchasing?

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not me to make
those contracts.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I was translating
some of the stuff.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's basically it.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we become in
possession of this craft?

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Was it in this
underground facility?

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It was.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that humans
were in possession of it.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I think they-- they, meaning the
Greys, have brought it in there

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and used it potentially for
recharging their bodies maybe,

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So it was basically
parked there.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I've not seen it
flying, operating,

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.450 align:middle line:90%
or something-- was just there.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it hovering
off the ground?

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:90%
But I have-- which is funny.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I have seen someone
hovering around the craft

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and doing some kind of
repair work or something--

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:90%
a human figure.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It was weird because
this is the first time

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.710 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen a person
hovering above ground.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:90%
And he was using--

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I assume it was a
he, but I don't know.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
He was using some kind of
tool, like a stick or something

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:90%
onto the craft.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is
that when I approached him,

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I had this message in my head,
which was like, oh, hey there,

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:90%
what's your origin?

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Where are you coming from?

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Was that the craft?

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Or was it the being?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It was actually the
figure that I had this--

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:84%
at least in my head, I had
this conversation with him.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:84%
He asked me, like,
oh, hello there.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:90%
And what's your origin?

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Where are you from?

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.380 align:middle line:90%
What's your planet?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.150 align:middle line:90%
That that's what he asked me.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
back something

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:90%
like Earth or something.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And I went on.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But it a was very
weird conversation.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So he basically
had this blue suit

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.199 align:middle line:90%
that was really, really tight.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:84%
And he had a mask that
looked like a fencer

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.429 align:middle line:84%
from the olympic
team or something--

onto his face, which
was kind of weird.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think he was
human or extraterrestrial?

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he was
definitely humanoid,

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.510 align:middle line:84%
meaning the size
was that of a human.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.710 align:middle line:90%
He had two arms, two legs.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if he was human.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I assume he was not.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I love your stories.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was very educational.

Tim, thanks for
being on the show.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:34:41.439 --> 00:34:42.239 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
