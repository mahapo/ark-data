>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
What about medical
devices of the future?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome to the program.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.203 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:84%
You have good experience
in medical technology--

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
what are the medical
devices of the future?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: The next evolution
is most likely going

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.390 align:middle line:10%
to be an app in your iPhone.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And the iPhone will
be like a SCENAR.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And it will also
be like a CAT scan.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So you could put
it on your breast

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can zoom in, just like
you zoom in on your pictures,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
cellular level.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
This technology already exists.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.939 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
time before it comes out.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.146 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Will it tell you
your arteries are blocked,

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:90%
go get some help right away?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It'll do things like this--
it can scan your body 400

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:90%
times better than a CAT scan.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
You can zoom in all the
way into the cellular level

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, look
at these 10 cells.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
They're cancer cells--
they're tumorigenic cells.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Push a button, send the
frequency, and zap those--

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:90%
never happen now.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.354 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you mean
we'll be curing ourselves?

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We'll be curing
yourselves, for sure,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
in your back pocket
if you've got a phone.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.098 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Now, wait a minute.

00:01:31.098 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Hospitals, doctors people
who are making money--

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
the pharmaceutical
industry-- do you

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:90%
think they want this to happen?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
A cheap little handheld device
that could attack illnesses?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I can assure you
they don't want anything out

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:90%
that fast.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So it will be a gradual display
of the technology coming out.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this thing will only be
used to spot it, not cure it.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have
to go in and get

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
your therapy done
for that-- whatever

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:90%
the treatment is they want.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So it will be a
very slow release

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:90%
of this type of technology.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And my goal is to get this
out to the world right now

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.212 align:middle line:90%
within the next

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.356 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's just
a very dangerous thing.

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
You're going up against
these very large corporations

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that have their own militia
and that will threaten you.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've been threatened in the
past many times-- as you know--

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:90%
with the medical devices.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have to incorporate
these corporations for now,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:84%
incorporate the
government into ways

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.579 align:middle line:84%
of getting the technologies
out in a safe way.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Well, look
what happened to Royal

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:10%
Rife and devices like that.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.957 align:middle line:10%
They chased this poor guy and
hounded him until he died.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's very tragic.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.706 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening
all over the world

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
even today, unfortunately,
with brilliant scientists,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and inventors, and engineers.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
The thing is to get a structure
built of an organization that

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
can expose this stuff through
clinical trials and things

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
like this and do it the
right way because that's

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:90%
the protocol we're in.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have to follow
these protocols

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and do it the right way so we
don't step on feet and people

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:90%
are not killed.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
nanite technologies?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, nanite
technology is-- on a nano level,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
there's ways to make very small
synthetic cells and robots

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:90%
that can go in the body.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And a good example
of an archaic one

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
is the camera that
you swallow and it

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:90%
records the entire time--

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Inside,
all the way down.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --going through
your digestive system.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the first things.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But they have things that
go into the bloodstream

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.714 align:middle line:84%
the same way, but on
a very small level.

00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:40.255 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: All hooked
into a computer?

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: All hooked
up to a computer.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And it runs through
your whole bloodstream.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It's made of an
organic material so it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:90%
does break down over time.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It
dissolves, you mean?

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It dissolves.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:90%
So this is where it's going.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So they can get an accurate
depiction of what's

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:90%
going on in your body.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
The main thing is,
we don't really

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
need to do that because
the technology exists right

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.160 align:middle line:84%
now in our
compartmentalized projects,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
where you lay on these tables
and your body is scanned.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
A 3D holographic image is now
projected above your body.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists
can move it around.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Zoom in like I
was talking about.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
And these three dimensional
holographic images

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.737 align:middle line:90%
are very, very--

00:04:22.737 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They're crystal clear.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.028 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Crystal clear.

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Just like I'm looking at you.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's a holographic
image of your entire body

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:90%
cell by cell.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So I can grab your body,
move it here, open it up

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.714 align:middle line:84%
before I operate on you and
see what's really going on.

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can these
little nanites

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
be hacked by somebody who's
sitting at another computer?

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Anything to do with
nanites that are--

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
because they're electrical
and they run off

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
the body's own electrical
system-- believe it or not.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:90%
It actually powers them.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Anyone could hack into
there and kill someone.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
You could be injected
with these things.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And could also be used
for really bad stuff, too.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
In projects, George, we
were able to clone people.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And they have a residual
memory locked into their DNA

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:84%
where these clones
would remember who

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:90%
they were in another past life.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they look
just like the body?

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're
exactly the same.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But what's
interesting is they retain--

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is the big
study going on now is--

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
how the heck are they
growing these clones--

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
even if they're
artificially put in a woman

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and gestated that way or
if they're grown in a vat--

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
how the heck do these clones
remember who they were?

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Answer that question.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's an energy
signature in the DNA

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to crack
that is like a hard drive that

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
never forgets about where
it actually came from.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So if it does get to become
an adult or a teenager,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
these clones do
remember and recall

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
certain aspects of the
life they had before.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.952 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes this happens
to people on planet Earth

00:06:03.952 --> 00:06:05.410 align:middle line:84%
where they're having
a recollection

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and think they
were reincarnated.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What's fueling this?

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
What is pushing this
kind of technology?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe, like
China just came out publicly--

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
they're growing humans because
of the need for organs.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And doesn't need to happen that
way because we have 3D printers

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
right now that can
print with your DNA,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:90%
we can print your liver.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:90%
We can print your heart.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And then, activate it.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Send a charge through it and
then put it into your body.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:90%
These are healthy cells.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
These cells were grown
with your DNA very quickly.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
suppressed technology

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that's actually been
around for quite some time.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.692 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to grow 3D
print bodies and activate them.

00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
They're having a lot
of problems with it.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly perfected,
but they're doing it.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's being
suppressed from us.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:84%
When we have this technology
right down the road,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:90%
where we can print you a liver.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The technologies
that you worked on,

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.769 align:middle line:90%
what were they like?

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're kind of
set up like an operating room.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:90%
They're seamless.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And everything is inside
the walls or in the ceiling.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's even--
if I'm operating

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have an
assistant, these robotic arms

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:84%
will come down from the ceiling
and someone can actually

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
be helping me from
very far away.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is now
technology they're

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
using now in open heart
surgery that in the early '90s,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:90%
it never existed.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.715 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That was it.

00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:34.515 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And also, while
working with different types

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies of
DNA and ET bodies,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:84%
you also had to use special
instruments because some

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
of our instruments and
devices would actually

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.624 align:middle line:90%
destroy the tissues.

00:07:46.624 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So you had to be careful with
the components that you were

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
using-- the different
types of metals,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:84%
the different types of
plastics, and things like this--

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:84%
when you're taking
samples and biopsies.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The neat thing about the med
lab that was in the programs

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
was this amazing table
that you could lay on.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And it-- like I said earlier--
it will your whole body

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and we could see if there
was any contaminates in you.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
If you had any tumors
or anything like that.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
But the table itself to also--

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
like the Rife machine--
shoot frequencies

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
in your body to realign
what needed to be fixed.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So in the future, I do
believe these tables will

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
be in everyone's homes because
you don't need to do anything.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
It can actually fix you.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Stop bleeding.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Enhance the broken bone
into healing within hours.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You just lie on top
of it and let it do its thing?

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You just
lie on top of it.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And through energy
and frequency,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
it actually heals
you and cures you.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
These fiber optics drop
down out of the ceiling

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
for getting a sample
out of the body--

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
it actually is like an
assistant that knows already

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:90%
what needs to be done.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
These tentacles will
come down and firm up.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
They could be so hard that
you could use it as a spear

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and punch through you.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
They can actually lift the
body up and turn it for you--

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:90%
these tentacles.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want just
an appendage out,

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
it can support the
appendage off of the table.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Or if you need it closer to
you because of magnification

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:90%
problems--

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:90%
things like this.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's all voice
activated, as well.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's all intuitive, very
kind of knows that you're

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:90%
going to be in this body.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need to
see this part of the body.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:90%
And it does it.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And like I said--
it's very strong.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:90%
These fiber optic cables--

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll call them-- can lift
the body up, turn it around.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Rotate it back and forth.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
It also can project through
these little holographic images

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
on what you're working on.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's overlaying
on top of this,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
an image of the
bone, the tendons,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
the ligaments are all shown
with light holographic

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:90%
on top of where I'm taking it.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And it shows me exactly
what biopsy to take

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:90%
from what part of the body.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like an AI--
artificial intelligence.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:84%
The programming of this stuff--
you have to understand--

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:90%
is light years ahead of us.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.099 align:middle line:90%
And it's reverse engineered.

00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
the table will

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:90%
know what is wrong with you.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
The table will know what
part of the body to fix.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So the future
with these devices,

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.817 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely astounding.

00:10:29.817 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, it's
amazing because this

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
is where it's going.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
If it's already here now
in these compartmentalized

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:84%
projects, it's just a matter
of time before we get it.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully, sooner than later.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.135 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How long do you
have to lie on the table?

00:10:42.135 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It depends on
what your problem is.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:84%
We're you just in
a car accident?

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Are you treating
some ongoing cancer?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it just you have
a tension headache?

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So all these factors
go into the treatment

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
of how the table
would like to fix you.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
programming of it.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the specifics.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how
the frequencies work.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen
people on these tables

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:90%
getting cured and healed.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.544 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these things are
also up on the space station's

00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:90%
that are up there right now.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Will they
ever enhance the power

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.125 align:middle line:84%
of telepathy and psychic
abilities with technology?

00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
right now, they're

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.249 align:middle line:84%
doing that with
supplements-- as you know.

00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
You hear about all
these supplements.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
These things-- what they
do is they allow the body

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to access different points
of the neural receptor sites

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:84%
so you can start using
these parts of your brain

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.944 align:middle line:84%
that you've never
really used before.

00:11:36.944 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So you have this increased
cognitive function.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You have this increased
remote viewing capability.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
You have this increased psychic
abilities-- all of our patients

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:90%
are telling us.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's all because of
activating certain parts--

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
frequencies or supplements

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:90%
that contain frequencies.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There's a study
at Stanford University where

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
they were able to work
with the genome sequence.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And people were able to
enhance their contact

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:90%
ability with extraterrestrials.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%
It's truly bizarre.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.810 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell us
about something like this?

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it just says
someone goes and meditates.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You are changing your frequency
and your genome sequence.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
You're getting
activated, too, when

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
you go out and do close
encounter of the fifth kind

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:90%
protocols.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
You're accepting
this energy that's

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
coming from either an
extraterrestrial location

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:90%
or from space.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.905 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is
being aware that you

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
are capable of almost anything
and then, focusing on that

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and allowing your
body to be activated.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You hear about these meditators
going well, I was activated.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.315 align:middle line:84%
Activation of the genetic
code is a very serious thing

00:12:49.315 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be proven
more with science--

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
like they just did with
Stanford with this.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:90%
So I completely agree with that.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It was used in the
projects a long time ago

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:90%
for the super soldier program.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And also, for the remote
viewers, where they were doing

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
this activation for
the genetic code.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was working--
whatever they were doing.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is driving
the technology, Emery?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
What is fueling it to make it
grow so quickly these days?

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: We are fueling it.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
The civilians of the world are
fueling where it's going to go.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And how fast it's
going to go there.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Because we're the ones
buying these products.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that
are watching us.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why they hire
all these amazing people

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.954 align:middle line:84%
to go into Walmart and
say use these colors.

00:13:31.954 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Put this here on this shelf.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.203 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Play this music.

00:13:34.203 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Play this music.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
a control factor

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's guiding us
where they want us to go.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.672 align:middle line:84%
But that's not where our
hearts want us to go.

00:13:46.672 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery,
we've been talking

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot about the
medical technology

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that you specifically
have been involved with.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
What else is out there?

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there was
a really interesting--

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:90%
going back to the table, again.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You love this table.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.573 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, I love the table,
but the table is just one

00:14:03.573 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:90%
aspect of the entire unit.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is there's
these fiber optic cables that

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:90%
come out very small--

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe less than a millimeter
in diameter or some up to 3,

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:90%
depends on what they're doing--

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and they have the ability
to come down to the body.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Attach to the body.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Scan the body.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And they do it all with light.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all photons.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually
shoot photons

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
into your body at a very atomic
level that I can't explain--

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm a physicist-- that allows
the body to regenerate itself.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is if
you can regenerate your body,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of,
almost live forever--

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Will the body
do that on its own?

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Like a lizard grows
a tail, will we ever

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:84%
be able to grow a finger
with that kind of technology?

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, yeah,
that's what I'm getting at.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:01.267 align:middle line:84%
You can regrow limbs or
you can 3D print a limb.

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
technologies I was exposed

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:90%
to while I was in there.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
The technologies out today--
which is interesting--

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
is like the four
states of water.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
There's some sort of energetic
properties of this plasma water

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
where we were able to grow back
fingers, just by soaking it

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:90%
in the water three times a day.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Gosh.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So this
stuff is out there,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.169 align:middle line:90%
but they can't talk about it.

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to
write white papers on it

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:90%
because it works too well.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think light
therapy is going

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to be the newest thing
because there's a way

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:84%
to cure the body just by using
different types of wavelengths

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's another
device out there

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that was in the projects
that just came out

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and this was an IV catheter
that has a light on it.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Many different colors of light.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:90%
There's red.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
There's blue.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:90%
There's green-- I think.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can stick this
into your antecubital vein

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and as the blood goes past this
light, it activates the DNA.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It activates things
in the DNA to allow

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:90%
you to be even more psychic.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.900 align:middle line:90%
To allow you to be more healthy.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:90%
To allow you to fight infection.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
In the nucleolus when the
DNA passes through the light,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:90%
there's an activation.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, the frequency
changes and it's like--

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:90%
it's a catalyst.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:84%
The entire body now is at
this different frequency.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And many things are
happening now in your body

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:90%
that you're not used to.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Your hearing improves.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Your sight improves.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Your sense of smell--

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:84%
we lose about 1% of our
sense of smell every year

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:90%
as we get older.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Which really affects our taste.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
If you can't smell,
you can't taste.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.532 align:middle line:84%
So all these things
are enhanced.

00:16:38.532 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are we
talking about technology

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
like that that will
continue to get

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:90%
better and better and better?

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
See, they're using this on
the surface of the skin.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.442 align:middle line:84%
And what happens if you put
that light inside the body?

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they're doing.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:84%
They're allowing the
blood to go through this.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And even in the projects,
there are special lightrooms

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:90%
where you just go in this room.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You sit down very comfortable
in these nice chairs, kind

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
of like recliners you
see in the dentist.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And you go through this
series of light therapy.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to wear special goggles
because the light is very, very

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:90%
bright.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It looks like all white light,
even through the goggles

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:90%
that are tinted.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.616 align:middle line:84%
It's a color spectrum
of light, but it's

00:17:19.616 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
so bright of that color that
it permeates your entire body.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't give you a
suntan or anything like that,

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
but it somehow allows
it to affect the blood

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:90%
below your skin.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Energizes it, somehow.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And the light is so
bright it actually

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
passes a little bit
through the dermis

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.397 align:middle line:90%
and into the bloodstream.

00:17:40.397 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There is a gland
in the body called the pineal

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:90%
gland--

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
is there anything
technologically

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.490 align:middle line:84%
that could stimulate
it to do what it does?

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: In the
projects, working a lot

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:84%
with this pineal gland, they
have a harmonic type of device

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:84%
that they can
basically, attach to it

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:90%
through your sinus cavity.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And it does a very quick, low
frequency vibratory harmonic

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:90%
tonality.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And it somehow breaks up
the calcium and the minerals

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:84%
that have been
collecting there-- almost

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:84%
every human being,
almost every human being

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:84%
has a calcified pineal
gland so you know.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But there are
devices like that are

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:84%
out there that they have
used in the projects

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to help stimulate this.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
of time before you'll

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
be able just to put
something here and then,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
allow that frequency to
go in to clear that up.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be like
breathing, again, after not

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.127 align:middle line:90%
breathing your whole life.

00:18:42.127 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there
anything technically that

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
would enhance telepathic
communication with us?

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.145 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's part
of the pineal gland, too.

00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It's an eye of not just
seeing, but it's also,

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
activating different
parts of the brain.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the brain wants to
use that gland for things,

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
but it can't because
it's blocked.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Can you enhance it?

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.376 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, so
it's a short circuit.

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So this would enhance
that-- correct.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:84%
This device would
actually enhance

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the ability for the brain
and the pineal gland

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
to work together.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Stenosis
of the spine is

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:90%
horrible for a lot of people.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:84%
What does the future hold
for something like that?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
a doctor named Dr.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:10%
Scuderi who invented the
alpha-2-Macroglobulin

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:10%
concentrator--

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:10%
which I've used
many times, and I

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:10%
think that's a fantastic
adjunct to stem cells

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:10%
and platelet rich plasma--

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:10%
it's a protease inhibitor.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a protein that's
only in your plasma.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to
extract this protein.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're using
it now for arthritis

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
by injecting it into the
facets and into the back

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to decrease the inflammation
so the body can heal itself.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a side effect that's
going to be coming out

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that they did a
study on with a2M

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and we've been able to
regenerate pretty much anything

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in the body for
a very long time.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's today,
but what about tomorrow?

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But we've never
been able to anti-age--

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:90%
that's where I'm going.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So this protein has
shown significant amazing

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:84%
capabilities to actually
anti-age tenocytes in cells.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
for us in the future

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:84%
is we might not be lifting
our hands to get aspirin

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:84%
or Motrin anymore
for our inflammation

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:90%
for the pain in our heads.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
We'll be grabbing this
alpha-2-Macroglobulin protein

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that's already viably
available in your body.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But they're making a
synthetic recombinant protein

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:84%
to this so they can
distribute it, of course.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And you never know--
you might be going in

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.635 align:middle line:84%
to get a a2M infusion which is
going to set you back 10 years.

00:20:39.635 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: See, I think
technology is amazing.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Even now, you go to your dentist
and he gives you a filling.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:84%
They put a light on the filling
to make it harder and quicker.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't burn your mouth.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not hot.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not cold.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It just somehow
solidifies the material.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.235 align:middle line:90%
Is this ET technology?

00:20:57.235 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, it is.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
It's reversed ET
chemical technology.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And we were using this in the
projects with the super soldier

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:84%
If one would break
their femur, we

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
could wrap this type of
cement putty around them

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and then, activate it
with the electricity.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's completely
sealed and completely

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:84%
ready to actually bear the
same amount of weight or more.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:90%
It increased bone density.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So these things are out
there that are not allowed

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:90%
into the civilian arms yet.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:90%
But you're absolutely correct.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It's slowly trickling out.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What does
the future hold

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of technology?

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to
get better for us?

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Or is it going to be used
for military purposes?

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen for it?

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Most amazing devices
developed in the military

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and developed in the
compartmentalized labs,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
usually takes a few
years to a few decades

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
to be sold to a regular
civilian corporation for it

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:90%
to be distributed.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And marketed.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.036 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And marketed.

00:21:58.036 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:90%
But this has happened.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of the stuff that you
see today is actually stuff,

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
of course, the government and
compartmentalized projects

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and corporations have
been using for decades.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.112 align:middle line:84%
So think what they
got today, George.

00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
If we're already getting
this really cool stuff right

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:84%
now released this year,
but we're still like,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.999 align:middle line:90%
20, 30 years behind.

00:22:17.999 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like when they build
these stealth fighters.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
hear about it until--

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But that's
exciting for the future.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It is because
we're going to--

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.528 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I can't wait.

00:22:25.528 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I can't
wait because I don't

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.180 align:middle line:84%
want to have to go the
hospital if I don't have to.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.414 align:middle line:84%
If I could do this at home
and do it cost effectively so

00:22:34.414 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
everyone has one
of these devices.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.804 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And it works.

00:22:36.804 --> 00:22:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it works.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:90%
It's proved to work.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Remember
the "Star Trek" shows,

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
where Bones, who was
a doctor, of course,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
used a device that he waved over
people that were on the ship

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:90%
and they got cured.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
That was an incredible device
that Bones used, wasn't it?

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, and it
wasn't too far-fetched.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a similar device that
we have out now by LET Medical

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:90%
called the SCENAR device.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a new type of
frequency healing.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the device can send in
these frequencies in the body

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and it can actually help
reprogram the nerves

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and reprogram the
voltage of things

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:90%
that are wrong in your body.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:21.001 align:middle line:84%
Such as if you had a headache
and you put this on your body.

00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It knows and sends a frequency
through your whole body

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.666 align:middle line:84%
and says well, this is
not aligned up right here.

00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:90%
This is a tension headache.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It can send a frequency
in to relax that muscle.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's technologies
out there today

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:90%
that have been out for a while.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because it's

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:84%
been illegal in the United
States of America forever.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.107 align:middle line:84%
But yet, a lot of the astronauts
in Russia and overseas

00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
have been-- it's standard issue
to have one of these with you.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, they swear by it.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So you take
this up with you

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:84%
when you're at
the space station.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
It's on every space shuttle
mission and things like that.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So they recently just got
the authorization now,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:90%
I think in Canada--

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago if you
were to order one of these

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
into the United
States of America,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:84%
they would confiscate it and
change out the circuit board

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.997 align:middle line:90%
so it would just be a TENS unit.

00:24:11.997 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Which gives you
a pulsating electrical--

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's just a pulse, yes.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.256 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's good
for your sore back.

00:24:16.256 --> 00:24:17.055 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it's sad that
this was happening,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
but this thing can
actually help cure diseases

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.379 align:middle line:84%
and help cure ailments
and things like that.

00:24:26.379 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that
technology is here.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's more
technology coming out.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, with
the faith healer,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:84%
they use energy that they
grab from the universe.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It goes through their
body and they project it

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
into the individual
they want to heal.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.294 align:middle line:84%
Does this device work
like a faith healer?

00:24:45.294 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, no,
I don't believe

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
it amplifies your
own energy, but I

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
do believe it helps regulate
the voltage in your body using

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.490 align:middle line:84%
frequencies so your body
can actually heal itself.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's all of these bombardments
of these lights and EMF fields

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and all the foods we eat.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the radiation
from the sun that ages us,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
destroys our cells,
and things like that.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to know
that the body is really

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:84%
good at regenerating itself if
it's at a nice homeostasis well

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's at this neutral state,
it can do amazing things

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:84%
But your body is
always fighting.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.436 align:middle line:84%
All day long, you're
fighting the viruses

00:25:24.436 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:90%
you picked up on the plane.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:84%
You're fighting the bombardment
of radiation and EMF fields.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It throws of the
frequency of the DNA.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Faith healers are using their
own energy-- their frequency--

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and pulling in energy
from around them.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is a
crystalline structure

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
which is full of
frequency and energy.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're always
emanating energy.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Some energy levels are
high in our bodies.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Some are low.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this organ
has a low energy.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this organ
has a high energy.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be at a certain
voltage of energy and frequency

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:90%
for it to operate efficiently.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What does the
SCENAR device look like?

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The SCENAR our device
looks like what Bones had.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:10%
It kind of looks
like a small iPhone.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.560 align:middle line:10%
And it's a little
thicker than that.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:10%
And it has usually,
three little metal prongs

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:10%
on the bottom end of it.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're very expensive--
$8,000 to $15,000.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No, that much?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.009 align:middle line:84%
And there's courses
now that they're

00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
giving here in the
United States and Canada

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:90%
for people to learn these.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a very important
piece of survival equipment

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
for anyone to have
because we also need

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.070 align:middle line:90%
to start treating ourselves.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:84%
We need to be the
physicians of our own body.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
We can't have a regulation
of big pharma telling us

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
or the American Medical
Association programming

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:90%
physicians well, step one, this.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Step two, that.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:84%
If this doesn't happen,
now you do step three.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.161 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do just wave it
over the person or they

00:26:48.161 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:84%
physically have
to be in contact?

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You
physically just run it

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:84%
down the body on the skin gently
so it is touching the body.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It has to measure the
current of the body.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.865 align:middle line:84%
So it's picking up the frequency
and the voltage of the body.

00:27:00.865 --> 00:27:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: A lot
of people believe

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that there's suppressed
technology out there.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
That governments
are holding back

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:84%
from letting us
know it's out there.

>>SMITH: Well, it's a good
example of ozone therapy.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven to
highly oxygenate the body

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and kill cancers and
things like this.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And the FDA would
not approve that.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just recently
that a few states now

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
are approved for
that, but it took

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:90%
20 years for that to happen.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with stem cells
and platelet-rich plasma.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I had the same problem when
I came out with my patents.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem was I was
going about the wrong way.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I was saying well, I'm treating
this and helping cure that

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:90%
and trying, again, to prove it.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.447 align:middle line:84%
You have to say, well, this
thing concentrates cells.

00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And give it to the
physicians and say,

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
well this may or
may not help you.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.119 align:middle line:84%
You can try it out
and let me know.

00:27:52.119 --> 00:27:54.284 align:middle line:84%
And then they come back
with all these side effects.

00:27:54.284 --> 00:27:56.922 align:middle line:84%
Well, it healed the wound twice
as fast-- did you know that?

00:27:56.922 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
No, I didn't, but can
you do white paper for me

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:90%
and let me now?

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:84%
As a device
manufacturer, you have

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to be really careful
when you come out

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:84%
with these amazing ideas
because you have to go about it

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and register it a very
certain way or the FDA

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:90%
will just shut it down.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, should
be on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Amazing material.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Thanks,
George, for having me.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.661 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This is
"Cosmic Disclosure"

00:28:19.661 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:90%
with our guest, Emery Smith.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.892 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.040 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.200 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They are finding
new things all the time.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.804 align:middle line:84%
New portals are--
like you said--

00:28:38.804 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:90%
sometimes they just open up.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe someone opened them up.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And that I
personally helped--

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
unknownst to me--
the enslavement

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:90%
of at least three planets.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Truth hurts.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And truth is change.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And all evolution
occurs through stress.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
through that in order

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to get to this other elevated
level of consciousness.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's just another step
towards truth and positivity

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:90%
for the world.
