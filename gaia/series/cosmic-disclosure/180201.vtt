00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Today we
have a special guest.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.960 align:middle line:10%
His name is Jason
Rice, and he claims

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:10%
to have been in the
Secret Space Program.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON RICE: Hello, Jay.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, it's
great to have you.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Why are you personally
coming forward?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'm coming forward now
because there are thousands

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
of others out there
that have been

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.252 align:middle line:84%
through this, that have gone
on the 20 and Back program.

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just
talking about Americans.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:90%
We're talking globally.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people
that did not come back,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:90%
their stories need to be told.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were soldiers or
scientists or just civilians,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
they provided and gave
the ultimate sacrifice

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And their stories
need to be told.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:90%
We need to have full disclosure.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
The people need to be
aware of some of the things

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:90%
that humanity has done.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It's time to heal and
to grow from that.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So let's start
with the beginning.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.925 align:middle line:90%
You had a behavior problem.

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you were constantly
being an escape artist.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I was.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I kept getting brought back
by the police or strangers.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I had my own dog tags--

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:90%
if lost, please call--

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:90%
on a chain.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the last time that I was
brought back by the same police

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
officer, he told my
parents that if they

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
didn't keep me contained
and keep control

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.245 align:middle line:84%
of where I was, that I was going
to be taken into state custody.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And this caused
your parents to freak out.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they're afraid of the
police and child protection

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
services and all those people
coming and investigating them--

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.315 align:middle line:90%
totally understandable.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:56.648 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Understandable-- of
course, they were terrified.

00:01:56.648 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And they found a
behavioral program

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.406 align:middle line:84%
at one of the local universities
and enrolled me in that.

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What happened there?

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They would
give us a command.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, say-- hey, I want
you to stay in this chair.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't get up.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
are toys everywhere

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
in the room, all kinds of
interesting distractions.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:90%
And so of course, I get up.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I got up, they
picked me up, put me in a box,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
locked the box, and
then would wait.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course I'd scream
and holler and yell

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and kick and thrash.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I stopped, they
would reach in, pull me out,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
set me on the same chair,
and give me an M&M.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.555 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they were starting
to form your personality

00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:43.355 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:44.313 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they were using
candy and toys to entice you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
into whatever they
wanted you to change--

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I guess change your behavior.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:90%
- --to control it.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And that program turns out
to be one of the recruiting

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:90%
arms for the MILAB program.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I was identified

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:90%
as an intuitive empath.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: When you say intuitive
empath, what do you mean?

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: An intuitive empath is
somebody that feels or knows

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
something without having
been told, without having

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
experienced it before.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It's an ability to
pick up on emotions.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not mind reading.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's being able to feel what
others are feeling and being

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
able to intuit why
they're feeling that way

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.565 align:middle line:84%
or how something
is supposed to work

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:33.065 align:middle line:84%
or how it's supposed
to go together.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
People have termed
or called it psychic,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really
the same thing.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.422 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You eventually
had to go to school.

00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you went to school,
first grade or whatever.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Did anything happen to you
when you went to school?

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So after getting into
school, what would happen

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
is that somebody would
either come in the morning

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
or towards the
middle of the day.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'd get picked up to
allow me to get out of school.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, they would take me to
an underground facility or just

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.434 align:middle line:84%
a regular building
to do the training

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:90%
that they had us go through.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there a break
between the university program

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.344 align:middle line:84%
and this new program,
which was I guess MILAB,

00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.573 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Explain to our
viewers what MILAB is.

00:04:20.573 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The MILAB program is
a military abduction program.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Which is one of the agencies
responsible for recruiting,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
training, indoctrinating,
and preparing children

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
for special programs within
the Secret Space Program

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.244 align:middle line:90%
and other classified projects.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought, at the
time, I was just

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
getting to go out on
a special field trip.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you're
with other children?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Other
children-- between three

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
and five other kids at a time.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what I remember.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And they had us working
on very simple puzzles.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
The caveat was that we
weren't allowed to talk.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But we had to work
in teams of two,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
sometimes three,
and work together

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.445 align:middle line:90%
to put this puzzle together.

00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
doing is, they

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
were training us with our
intuitive empath abilities

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:90%
in teamwork.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Progressed on up through
smaller pieces, more pieces.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:90%
And again, we couldn't talk.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
We had to nonverbally
communicate and trust and work

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
with our intuitive
empath abilities

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
up to the point where
it was a single colored

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:84%
puzzle with thousands of pieces
that were working together.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They also included
blindfolding to work

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
together so that we could work
our intuitive empath abilities

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:90%
and teamwork.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Would it be fair to
say that they are looking

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:90%
for that quality in these kids?

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's absolutely right.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
that quality in people

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
because it makes for better
soldiers, better operatives.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
You can walk into a room
and pick up on a situation--

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:84%
five or six different
people all at one time--

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.905 align:middle line:84%
and be able to read the
scenario, read the environment.

00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you notice a
refining process with these kids

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and you, where you could
see that some were not

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.284 align:middle line:84%
going to make it and others
were going to go forward

00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes-- there
were people that

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:90%
just weren't picking up on it.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:90%
They weren't progressing.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And usually, those children
didn't stay, didn't come back.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they used
medications on us

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
for improving our
intuitive empath abilities

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
as well as to
facilitate forgetting--

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
not remembering where we'd
gone or what we'd done,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and then implanting us
with false screen memories.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Why would they do that?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't want to
have the public aware of what

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:90%
they were doing.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were taking
kids out of school

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever they
needed them to do.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
If the world had found out
that they were taking kids out

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
of school to go work on training
and that they were injecting

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
them with either experimental
or non-market medications,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.105 align:middle line:90%
people would be up in arms.

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there any kind of
trauma associated with this?

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Well, tell me about that.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.901 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, so
some of the training

00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
involved finding out
our individual fears

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and then flooding
us with those fears.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if one
was afraid of drowning.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Because that, they would
use virtual reality,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:90%
augmented reality.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is in the late
'70s, long before any of it

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:90%
was ever out on the market.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And so as a child, it was like--
wow, this is an amazing toy.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a great adventure.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Except for the fact that
they were trauma training,

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:90%
is what they were doing.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.145 align:middle line:84%
So they find out
all of my fears,

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
everything that I was afraid
of-- whether it was a little

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:90%
or a lot--

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and then put me into
a virtual reality

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
where I couldn't tell the
difference between what was

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.675 align:middle line:90%
real and what was the virtual.

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'd go
through and have

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:84%
to experience-- whether it was
death by fire or getting shot

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
or bludgeoned or drowning or any
number of horrible ways to die.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:84%
They'd flood you with it
to desensitize you to it.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:90%
And these are children.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: When you got home
after these experiences,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.835 align:middle line:84%
did your parents notice
that you were messed up?

00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they
would go through

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and mind wipe and give
you a screen memory.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So instead of getting
burned up in a fire

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
all day five or
six times, I would

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:84%
remember being at an aquarium
in my conscious mind.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But the nightmares
were still there.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I'd still have nightmares.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd still have periods
where I wouldn't eat

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
or periods that I was moody.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So of course, my parents
had nothing to base it on.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So to them, I was
just a kid growing up.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
During the night, they would
take us out of our homes.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
They would take us
to closed-down malls

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:90%
for the evening.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, we would either
do small combat arms,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:84%
immediate action drills, capture
the flag type thing where

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:90%
we would have small pistols.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And we wore a suit that,
if it was contacted

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:84%
by the infrared beam,
it would freeze the limb

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:90%
if it was a grazing shot.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:84%
If it was a shot
right to a fatal area,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.809 align:middle line:84%
then the entire suit
would freeze up.

00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And they'd have to reset
the program because that

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:90%
was a simulated kill.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
They would put us
against each other.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And we found out quickly who had
more strength in their ability

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:90%
for tactics.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
is, it turned

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:90%
into not every man for himself.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But it turned into teaming
up with other people

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.715 align:middle line:84%
and then ganging
up on one person.

00:09:46.715 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So kind of creating
a self-organization.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.796 align:middle line:84%
So you guys are organizing
yourselves in a symbiotic way

00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
instead of having
it be top-down.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.142 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's very
serious training.

00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Very traumatic,
it's very traumatic.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How long do this
period of your training last?

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It went on for about
eight years until I was 13.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All right,
so now you're 13.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
You've got this training.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't be doing
it for no reason.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:90%
It costs a lot of money.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle line:90%
They're investing a lot in you.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:90%
What happened at this point?

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That was the year that
they took me out of training

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:90%
and put me into active service.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What happened?

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.655 align:middle line:84%
How did this-- did
they tell you they

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
were going to take you into
the Secret Space Program,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:90%
or what do they do?

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, this
particular day,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.229 align:middle line:84%
I was going to meet them
down the street from school.

00:10:37.229 --> 00:10:38.936 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to the
rest of the school,

00:10:38.936 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:90%
I was just skipping.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:90%
But I was down the street.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I met them just like any
of the many other times.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Got in the back of the car.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell
me that I was going

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:84%
to be disappearing,
that was going

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.842 align:middle line:90%
to be going into active duty.

00:10:53.842 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They did not tell you.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.226 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Did not--
they just took me.

00:10:57.226 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That was a surprise.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Surprise-- guess what.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I hope you said goodbye
to everybody this morning.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't have all the memories
from my first 20 and Back.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:90%
They haven't returned yet.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
20 and Back program is based on
the use of advanced technology

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
where you provide
service for 20 years.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that service, you

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:84%
are medically and quantum
age regression back

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to the time point
where you originally

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:90%
entered into service.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, they take you back
in time to the point in time

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that you originally
went into service.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But you still lived out and
had those 20 years of service

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that you provided
in whatever program.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of
secret space programs

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.805 align:middle line:90%
that utilize this technology.

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did they take care
of you when you came back?

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: When I got back, part of
the going away present package

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that they left included
programming for me

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to want to go into
the military service.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And seemingly overnight,
I developed an interest

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go to college,
wanted to get an education.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I was a driven
individual at that point.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.925 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you go to
high school, I assume?

00:12:14.925 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I went to high school
and maintained 3.9 GPA all

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:90%
through high school.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was awarded a medical
scholarship for the Air Force

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:90%
ROTC.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was awarded an engineering
scholarship for the US Army.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.925 align:middle line:90%
And I chose the engineering.

00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:35.166 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did you
finish your four years?

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I finished
my four years.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.373 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And then, you
went into the military.

00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The military 20
and Back that I went on

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
was right at the start
of my US Army career.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
The second 20 and Back, I have
a lot more of those memories.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I was commissioned the same
day I graduated from college

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:90%
which was in December of 1996.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And two months later, I was
given a change to my orders.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Which my original orders were to
report in to Fort Leonard Wood

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to attend the
officer basic course.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And the day before I
was supposed to leave,

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I got new orders assigning me
to the Army Research Office

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:90%
up in North Carolina.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea why or what,
no explanation for it.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So two months after
you started your active duty,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:90%
they grabbed you again.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Again.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why are all these people
now coming forth with memories,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like it takes
15, 20 years for the memories

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:90%
to surface?

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.025 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, for some
reason or another,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%
the memories are always there.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
For me, one of them
was at the age of 33

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be 20
years after my 20 and Back.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I went in for
outpatient surgery.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And coming out of
it, I was still

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:90%
under a lot of the anesthesia.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And I don't recall this.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But the nursing
staff told me I was

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
talking about being in space
and being a part of a program

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.494 align:middle line:90%
and going out and doing things.

00:14:05.494 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when they
were telling me this,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm like-- wow, I don't
remember saying any of that.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, it
was just one of those--

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, that was just the
anesthesia talking.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Since then, I've realized that--

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, that was another sign.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Should people who are
running these programs be

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
worried about people now having
the first wave of memories

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:90%
coming back?

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think the people that
are running these programs--

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
part of the technology that
they use for the mind wipe,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
they know that there's 1%
to 3% that the mind wipe

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.300 align:middle line:90%
will not work on.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And they have returning memories
a lot faster than mine were.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
