>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Have humans ever worked side
by side with extraterrestrials?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Emery, welcome back
to the program.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Many of the
projects you have worked with,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:90%
you have dabbled with ETs.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this camaraderie.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: In the projects,
especially the ones I was

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:10%
involved with--

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:10%
and, first of all,
let me first state

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:10%
that there's thousands
of extraterrestrials

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:10%
working amongst us daily
in corporations and all

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:10%
around the planet.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And they look kind
of just like us.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't really notice
passing one in the streets,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
if that was an
extraterrestrial or not.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of
extraterrestrials

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that I have worked with
do look exactly like us,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:84%
with some differences
maybe in eye set,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
usually with the cartilaginous
parts of the body,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
like the nose and ears, might
be a little bit different.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone to know
that right off hand.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:84%
These ETs are very
compassionate.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Some have volunteered
to be here.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Some have crashed here.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Some have been shot down here.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Some, at one time, were being
held maybe against their will.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they
decided it'd be safer

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
for them to stay in the
projects and help us advance

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:84%
different technologies,
and help teach us

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
about their civilizations,
and how they live,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and all their belief systems.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.844 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
beautiful things

00:01:43.844 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
in working with
extraterrestrials,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of course, that I
talk about a lot

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.356 align:middle line:90%
is this language of telepathy.

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
new thing that's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
going to be coming out
here soon, I think,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in society within
the next decade,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to kind
of communicate just

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
by looking at someone, which
we're starting to do now.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
People are getting
more sensitive.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
People are being able
to read people better.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
People are understanding
how to tell if someone's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:90%
being deceitful or not.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:84%
They also feel joy
and happiness when

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
someone walks into the room, and
they're very happy and joyful.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.017 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at
someone, especially

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
if you spent a lot of time with
someone, like your loved ones,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.821 align:middle line:84%
All I need to do is
look across the room,

00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and I know if I did
something wrong.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:90%
And it is like this feeling.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And it starts off
with-- telepathy is not

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
so much of what people
see in the movies,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
where "hello, George"
in my mind, and you

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:90%
hear my voice-- "hello, George."

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, "it's Emery."

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It's more of an
emotion based language.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest thing I picked
up by being in the projects,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
by working side by side
with these specialized

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials that
are like scientists just

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
like we have scientists, doctors
just like we have doctors--

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that they're very
similar to us in many ways.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
They have a very comic side
to them, a very humble side

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
They know that we were
once them at one point,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
so they're very
compassionate about us.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
you have to do,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
when I know I'm going
to be in the same room

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:84%
as an extraterrestrials
that day,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
is you really got
to clear yourself

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:90%
of all negative energy.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You have to clear
yourself of the fight

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
you had last night with
your son or daughter.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
You've got to come in there
grounded, centered, and ready

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Why?

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because, if you go
in there, and you're upset,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and I walk in here, and
I'm very upset inside,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.890 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know it,
and I'm like "hi, George."

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:90%
To them, it's like "hi, George."

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, they feel you're
emotional already.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So, by me saying
"hello," the emotion that

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
went with the "hello,"
even though it was not

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.445 align:middle line:84%
meant to be that way, they pick
up on my inner, deep emotions.

00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So they know there's
something bothering you,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're upset,
and it can send off

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
a miscommunication
to that being,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:90%
if they're not evolved enough.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.315 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why are
they here, Emery?

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they go
back to their planet?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm not sure if we're
allowing them to go back, first

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.221 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about that.

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
All I know is the
ones that I worked

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
with are very blessed and happy
to be here, and work with us,

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and teach us new things,
and help us evolve.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, that doesn't
sound like a captured ET,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
does it, if they're
happy here and things

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:90%
are going well for them?

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, just like
the most amazing volunteers

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
of the world in Red
Cross, we sacrifice

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to go to third
world countries that

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.785 align:middle line:90%
are under famine and war.

00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Yeah, but we
decide that on our own.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that
these ETs are captured.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a big difference.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.596 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I'm
just saying some.

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of these ETs have been
captured, I'm aware of.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And they had made
their own decision

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to stay here, and help
us, and do things.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it shows the
amount of love, consciousness,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and compassion that they
have that we don't have,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have yet.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Could they go
back if they wanted to?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I'm not sure.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I think, if they
really wanted to,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
they could, but they
don't tell us that.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But, I was not in part of that
security of those projects.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling
you what I've heard

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
extraterrestrials

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:90%
through telepathy.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.305 align:middle line:90%
Because I ask questions.

00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course the first thing
is, "how did you get here?"

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:90%
"Are you happy here?"

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.745 align:middle line:84%
And they are not allowed to
say too many things, either.

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:44.195 align:middle line:84%
They have a limit of
what should be said

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:90%
and what shouldn't be said.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So they're
restricted, too.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
yeah, I think they

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
are doing the restriction,
though, to not

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:90%
let out too much information.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.742 align:middle line:84%
Because we, as humans,
will get information,

00:05:55.742 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:90%
like people are hearing this.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to assimilate that

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
for the positive
or the negative.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
hard thing to grasp,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
listening to one of these
shows, because not everyone is

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:90%
on that same page.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there a craft
here hidden away somewhere?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yes.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
There's ET craft, and
there's ETs all over.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of ETs, too, people
think, like we were talking

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
about this the other day--

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
like, the oceans are a
great place for these things

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:90%
to hide in.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:90%
And of course it is.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
It's such a large, vast area.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But a craft can be
the size of a marble,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:90%
like just a lit up marble.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And, since they have conquered
the physics of changing

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.595 align:middle line:84%
atomic structures, that you
might have a whole civilization

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
there-- you might
have a crew of 500

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:90%
in this little glowing light.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Or, if they want to manifest
that into their real craft,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
then you have
something like you see

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
in the movies, this giant
craft like the one that's

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
coming out of
Antarctica right now,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:84%
melting, this couple
mile long craft.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So there are the 3D aspects of
materialization of these craft,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
going from a light
to this giant craft.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But you have to also
understand that there is

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:90%
science behind how that works.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What kind
of craft are here?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Is it like a mother ship
flying around the planet?

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It could be.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
There are craft
kind of outside of--

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
a little bit past some
of the closer planets,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
some off of the coast
of Saturn there that

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
are sitting there that
are 33 miles long.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of craft that
are just staying a little bit

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
distant and kind of
watching over us and making

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
sure we don't blow up
the planet or anything.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's any
evil intentions to any

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of these craft that people
are seeing around the world

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and in the oceans.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
There's not been
anything demonstrated.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
If anything, they
demonstrate that they don't

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:90%
want us to use nuclear bombs.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us
to do any of this.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I think, that
being said, there's

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
multiple craft all around
the planet all the time.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.919 align:middle line:84%
There could be one right
now above us at 40,000 feet,

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't see it,
because it'd be cloaked.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they have that
ability to do that.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, you see these
lenticular clouds,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and ET craft can
look like a 747.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:90%
You won't even know it.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
They do this so they can get
around, and monitor, and also

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:90%
show themselves in a safe way.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What kind of projects
are these ETs working on here?

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing here?

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.441 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, my goodness.

00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
They're so involved with
reverse engineering,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
helping us reverse
engineer craft, devices.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they're big
in the genetics programs.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
They were in my programs where
we were just harvesting things.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Without
their input, could we

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:90%
be doing what we're doing?

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, that's impossible.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we go from horse and
buggy to landing on the moon.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think we've been
helped all along the way.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And whether we reverse
engineered something,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
or they shared some
technology with us,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
meeting with different
world leaders, or whatever,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
we definitely have had help
in the technologically science

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
based arena here
in planet Earth.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What
kind of technology

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:30.042 align:middle line:84%
have they given us that we have
utilized in our everyday life?

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you
just look around here.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, cameras, and lenses,
and infrared technologies,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:90%
thermal imaging--

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, this was all
reverse engineered.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you see
today that's electronic

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
has something in it that we
did not find out for ourselves.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that we can, number
one, reverse engineer something

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
from something we have
no idea, which we did.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's also amazing that, now,
with the advancements of ETs

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
working with major
corporations, and engineers,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and in the underground projects,
that new technologies come out

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have this,
if you've noticed,

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in scientific magazines, that
the trajectory of how fast this

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.657 align:middle line:84%
is happening, overnight, with
the technologies now, where you

00:10:17.657 --> 00:10:20.984 align:middle line:84%
can put something on your phone,
scan the whole room, and 3D

00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
print the whole
room if you want--

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's these amazing
things that are coming out,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
even especially with
medical technologies.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Now they're coming out with
tables that can holographically

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
scan your whole body, and
you can move it around,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.715 align:middle line:90%
the surgeon--

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And this
is all ET related?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And this is
all ET related stuff.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Do they eat?

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Do they sleep?

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Do they get paid?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.652 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, that's a good
question, too, the payment

00:10:44.652 --> 00:10:45.451 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the questions
I asked a long time ago.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
They are compensated
somehow, but I do not

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:84%
know how, because they don't
use, of course, our Earth

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
money, unless they work on
the top side, we call it.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And as far as eating,
they do eat, some of them.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.807 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, eating is
more like a social thing--

00:11:04.807 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:90%
if you want to eat, you can eat.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
But you don't really have to,
because the higher beings have

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.729 align:middle line:84%
an ability to transmute a
sandwich into their system

00:11:13.729 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and use the good parts of that.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Without eating it--

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Without eating, right.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see a
lot of ETs with these--

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you see pictures of
ETs with very small mouths.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:90%
And they don't--

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Slits--

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.058 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, little slits--
because they kind of gave it

00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:90%
up a long time ago.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And their bodies
are getting smaller.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Their heads are getting bigger.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Do they sleep?

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, they sleep,
and just like we sleep.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to sleep.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on how
that ET wants to be--

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.757 align:middle line:84%
just like here-- do you
want to be someone that eats

00:11:46.757 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
really healthy, or do
you want to be someone

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.335 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't eat healthy?

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
The ETs don't need
any of this stuff.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But they do it,
because a lot of them

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
also are trying to have what
we call the human experience.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
They want to feel, and it's
an honor for them to be here,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to have the human experience,
and to play like--

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, "human"
meaning this time--

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:90%
at this time, George.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And to play that part,
for them, is also

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:90%
an honor to do and to enjoy.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Because that gets lost
way down the road.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, the senses start to
kind of go away a little bit.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
that-- man, waking up

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the smell of a
fresh bed of roses,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
because other things
have taken over, that we

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:90%
evolve in a different way.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where
do they live here?

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: ETs live
in these facilities

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:90%
underground that we have.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They're very nice, kind of
like-- it depends, also,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:84%
where the ET is from, of what
their facility looks like.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:90%
They try to make it as--

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
especially maybe this
ET is eight feet tall,

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
so we can't put them in one
of the regular barracks.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:90%
They need their own section.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did they
genetically alter humans,

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
or whatever species might have
been on the planet, a long time

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:90%
ago?

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Are we them?

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: My belief
system in that

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is the ETs that are working
with us now did not do anything

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:90%
with us genetically.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe there is an
ancient race that definitely

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:90%
made us for sure.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They're our
gods, aren't they?

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.367 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some refer to them
as the Nephilim, the Annunaki.

00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These ETs
that are here now,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
you said there's
thousands of them.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.525 align:middle line:84%
How many different sects
or races are there?

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I
don't know the number.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell you that.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I just know of maybe 10
or 20 different races.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
There's probably a lot more than
that from around the systems.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
understand, too, it's

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of a conjoint effort
of many civilizations

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:90%
that are working together.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.776 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like--

00:13:56.776 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
well, Emery, what's
your lineage?

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.108 align:middle line:90%
What's your background?

00:13:59.108 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you
like 10 different things.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.077 align:middle line:84%
So an extraterrestrial, at
this point, is the same way.

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's your lineage?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Are you Arcturan or Pleiadian?

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
already interbred.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's many different
types of extraterrestrials

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:90%
as far as lineages go.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
What the interesting thing
is, all the extraterrestrials

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked on
had human DNA in them.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So they somehow were
part human or something

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.267 align:middle line:84%
at one point in their
genetic lineage.

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do you
know we can trust them?

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The only way I could
tell the public is to-- well,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
let's see what they have
demonstrated so far.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just, to me, I trust you,
because you're demonstrating

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:90%
something to me over time.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
you earn trust, is

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:84%
what you demonstrate,
what have you

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
done to show your love and
compassion for this society

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:90%
and for the planet?

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I kind of--

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say the word judge.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I kind of look
at things, and kind of just--

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.874 align:middle line:84%
that person or that
being will be that way.

00:15:03.874 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
That's just because
of the way they are,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:90%
so you have to accept that.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And they have to demonstrate
how are they going to fit in,

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and how are they going to be a
productive member of society,

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Our "Cosmic
Disclosure" audience

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:90%
is tuned into this.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:90%
They get it.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:90%
They understand it.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But, if you were
to tell somebody

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:84%
on the outside we've got
thousands of extraterrestrials

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:90%
here, they're working with us--

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
so how do you convince them
what's going on, or do you?

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely not.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to convince
anyone of anything.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to tell you my
experiences to the best

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:90%
of my ability, and that's all.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
people out there wanting

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to kick the tires on the UFO,
and it doesn't work that way.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
What I tell everyone is
don't believe anything

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
you hear, see, read,
watch, because all

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%
that can be manipulated.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is
you need to go out there,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and you need to investigate
yourself, like I did,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and like many others
have done, and interview

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:13.185 align:middle line:84%
many, many other people, to see
how the stories do interlock,

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and be an investigator.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Find out, and use your
heart, not your head.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And don't be ignorant, and
open up the possibility

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that there might be life
beyond planet Earth.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
majority of the population

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:90%
is going in that trajectory.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that people are
getting more intelligent.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:84%
They're doing their
own investigations

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.067 align:middle line:84%
and finding out information
on their own for themselves,

00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
if anything, which is the
most important thing you

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:90%
can do for yourself.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You have worked
side by side with these ETs.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Have you developed a
friendship with any of them?

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.432 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, of course.

00:16:54.432 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you
socialized with them at all?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I've
never been topside

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
with any extraterrestrial
from within the projects.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to fraternize
with anyone from the projects

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:90%
once you leave the project.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
contact anyone that you know.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
do anything like that.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, most of
them do stay underground

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:90%
in the facilities.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen one topside that
were down in the facilities.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
They have their own place
that they take them to.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I've never been there.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I just know they have
their own special area.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Just like I have to jump
on these different devices

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to get to my workspace, they
also are going somewhere else.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Do they have names?

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, they
do have names.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:90%
They also have numbers.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
They like to refer
to them as numbers.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have name badges, so
you guys know, on the projects.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.787 align:middle line:84%
We have these
bracelets that contain

00:17:52.787 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our information, and
they know everywhere we're

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:90%
at, all the time.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And, when you meet
an extraterrestrial--

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:84%
not to sound funny, but it's
like meeting a performer--

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.699 align:middle line:84%
they come up with a
regular English name.

00:18:09.699 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: For themselves?

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, for themselves.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, just like you
know Ted, Jack, Jill.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so they come up with
this to make it easier for us,

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's not
a security thing so much.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more of, "hey,
I'm kind of like you, too,

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:90%
so don't treat me special.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.227 align:middle line:84%
But, at the same time, if
you have any questions,

00:18:31.227 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to help you with that."

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:90%
So they're very cordial.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.222 align:middle line:90%
They're very proper.

00:18:35.222 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've have
mentioned that they

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:90%
communicate with telepathy.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Do they also speak?

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, most ETs
that I've worked with all

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
speak perfect English and many
multiple languages easily.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of weird to
hear someone speak so many

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:90%
different languages.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Their brain capacity,
and IQ, and intelligence

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
is so far beyond ours.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, yeah.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.318 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be immense.

00:19:01.318 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You kind of
feel like the child

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.271 align:middle line:90%
all the time around them.

00:19:04.271 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But their heads
look the same as ours?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: So they've come here.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Have we gone there to help them?

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
rumor about that.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know firsthand.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I just know second
hand experience

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that there have been
people that have

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%
gone to other civilizations.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.079 align:middle line:84%
But that's just second hand
information I couldn't verify.

00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, as you've
worked with them, what

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
have you learned about them?

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:90%
What have they taught you?

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they
taught me many things.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I think we've--
not only myself--

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I speak for others
in the projects--

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that you learn so
much, because you're

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
dealing with someone from,
let's say, another country,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're learning
all about their habits,

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and what's fun for
them, and their hobbies.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And, at the same time,
you're being taught a lesson

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of love and compassion.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.861 align:middle line:84%
And, a lot of times,
the banter is not--

00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't really get
to sit there and say,

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:90%
"well, how was your day?

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And what movie did you see last
night, and how are the kids?"

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It's more like this is what
we're working on today.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:90%
We kind of keep it with that.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And what's funny is,
they'll say something like,

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.737 align:middle line:84%
"sorry about what
happened last night."

00:20:23.737 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They know.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.153 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They already
know everything,

00:20:26.153 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:90%
so there's like no secrets.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
probably one of the biggest

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
gifts, is to work
with a bunch of people

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
that you could be
yourself and never

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:84%
have to be someone you weren't,
or embellish on anything.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:84%
You could just be you,
and they accepted you.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
everyone has secrets.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has some
good and bad to them.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And they know immediately
kind of everything about you,

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and especially if you think
about it in your head,

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
like a past memory,
like if you were

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
a child, or a bad situation,
or a good situation.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:90%
They know it immediately.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because, even
though you're on a Friday--

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, working
late Friday night--

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and you have a date
that night, and you're

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of anxious to get out of
there, and they're laughing,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:90%
you know, they're chuckling.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:20.912 align:middle line:90%
I never said anything.

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But they're laughing
and chuckling.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
They're like, "oh, I hope
everything goes great for you

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:90%
tonight."

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just like this
really comic, that funny,

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.390 align:middle line:84%
lighthearted acceptance
of each other.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you ever
witnessed a temper from them?

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Never.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Ever?

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.346 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They've never
been out of character?

00:21:37.346 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Never.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.285 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do they
want out of all this?

00:21:40.285 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think they really do,
the ones that are here, really

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:90%
want to help.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
They really want to
be part of the history

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:90%
of the lineage of humans.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
These people, I
think, have something

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
to do with our
future, to be honest.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I think they're here
to keep us on track,

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure we don't
do anything to destroy

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:90%
the planet and each other.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are they amazed at
how warring we are as a species?

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.111 align:middle line:90%
We're always fighting.

00:22:10.111 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, we're
always fighting.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're always warring,
and we're all fear based.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the--
where they come from,

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:90%
there is no fear based anything.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about war.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about money.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about disease.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
If we've got rid of all this
stuff, which we will soon,

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:84%
we could be a more
productive race.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And that can do amazing things.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
that's going to be coming,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:84%
a big breakthrough for all of
us here coming shortly right up

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.250 align:middle line:90%
the chain here in a few years.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What planetary
system are they from?

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't know exactly.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't really talk about
exactly where they're from.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I can
guess is somewhere

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
from Arcturus and
Pleiades systems,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and somewhere from Boots.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
thing I could really

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:90%
make a correlation with.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
They never would come
out and say, "well, I'm

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:90%
from this place."

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Because a star system--

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.659 align:middle line:84%
that's like saying, "well,
you know, I'm from"--

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Third star on--

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, you
know what I'm saying.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't work
that way specifically.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And I never had a conversation
where they actually looked

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
at me and said, "well, I am this
person from this place" at all.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
It was more a very low key,
very casual conversations

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you
remember the first time

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:90%
you met an extraterrestrial?

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What was
that like for you?

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I wasn't aware
that the person on the team

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:84%
was until he telepathically
communicated with me.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't look like
any different than we did.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.769 align:middle line:84%
I had to take this
commander's word for it.

00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:56.935 align:middle line:90%
And we finished the project.

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.143 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did you believe it?

00:23:58.143 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I did, because,
when the introduction happened,

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
it was basically
"pleased to meet you"

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:90%
is what I felt in my heart.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked and said
"pleased to meet you,"

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.912 align:middle line:90%
but I said it like from inside.

00:24:12.912 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: From inside of you.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.205 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And he
picked up on it.

00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, immediately.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I was
kind of jealous about--

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
they know everything about me,
but I don't have the training

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:90%
to know everything about them.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So they have some sort of
block that they probably shut

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
down or shut off, that they
only transmit certain aspects

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:39.380 align:middle line:84%
of communication for general,
back and forth banter, nothing

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
allowing me to you know
also make a connection,

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:90%
to go in to see what they see.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If the world knew
what you know, and they're

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
getting there by
watching this program,

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.835 align:middle line:90%
how much would they be in shock?

00:24:54.835 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think,
when it does happen,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
where there is maybe something
tangible as far as craft

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.059 align:middle line:90%
coming, and beings coming--

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Something's obvious--

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Something very obvious
that the media cannot hide--

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I think people will be in
shock for a little bit.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're going to
be also in acceptance of it.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't think--
there's going to be,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
of course, the naysayers,
and the fanatics,

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and "this is bad," "these
are demons from Satan,"

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Because, like I said, in
order to establish trust,

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:90%
you have to watch what they do.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to see what this new
race is that we're meeting,

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:84%
give them a chance,
and see what they show

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:90%
us, show their true intentions.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you
are very hopeful?

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm very
hopeful, absolutely,

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:84%
very hopeful that,
when this happens,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
it'll be a positive
event, and it also

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to help us jump-start
our technologically advanced

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:84%
civilization to end hunger,
to end homelessness,

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.625 align:middle line:84%
to end disease, to end the
poisoning of the oceans,

00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So, overnight, I
think there will

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
be this slow transition
of technology,

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:90%
and also how can we help you?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:90%
How can we help your planet?

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be like
they're coming here and saying,

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:84%
"I want all your gold,
and your sperm, and eggs."

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
enough of that,

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and they can make that
in any form they want.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.206 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Anytime they want.

00:26:40.206 --> 00:26:45.652 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, so I don't
see what that would serve.

00:26:45.652 --> 00:26:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Somewhere
along the line,

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be an
agreement between governments

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:90%
and the ETs for this to happen.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you think that occurred?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I
don't believe the ETs

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.280 align:middle line:90%
need any agreements to be here.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
They are so
technologically advanced.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:90%
If they didn't want--

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:84%
they don't need to tell
anyone they're here.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
There could be an ET
in this room right now

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:90%
in the production crew.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't even know it.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But
somebody, somewhere

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.029 align:middle line:84%
had to arrange the working
relationship with them.

00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean, how would
they even know they were ET?

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Yeah, but how
would they get hired?

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
How would they get
brought in on a project?

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, like I said,
they have come and integrated

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
themselves in all
the societies here,

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and are just kind of
watching what's going on,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and working as
regular individuals.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:90%
And I mean regular individuals.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.194 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Don't they
disclose they're ETs?

00:27:39.194 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, absolutely not.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They don't?

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, they do not.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:90%
No one knows they're ETs.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wait a minute.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:84%
You mean everybody
that's working with them,

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.429 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows they're ETs?

00:27:49.429 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm talking about the
topside extraterrestrials that

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
are working in your
major corporations

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.027 align:middle line:84%
and also in political
governments.

00:27:56.027 --> 00:27:57.484 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Nobody
knows they're ETs?

00:27:57.484 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No one
knows those are ETs.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So they've
been infiltrated?

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have definitely
been infiltrated in a good way.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.353 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why would it
be a good way, Emery,

00:28:05.353 --> 00:28:07.336 align:middle line:84%
if they don't want to
disclose who they are?

00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know, it's
just like the parents

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
watching the children.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it sinister that they're
tracking them on their phones?

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.879 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because they need
to know, and keep them safe,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and make sure they're not
doing the wrong thing.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So they're gathering
information,

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and gathering the conscious
levels and energies of society.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And many ETs walk amongst
us in a diverse amount

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:90%
of ways, which means--

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:84%
it's not like they're all
billionaires in charge

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
of major corporations.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying there's ETs washing
dishes down at the restaurant,

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and there's ETs that are
running major corporations.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:84%
They're all over, just kind of
integrated and following us.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You had mentioned
that they live underground.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like an
organized situation to me.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.969 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:28:59.969 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, like I
said, these ETs have either

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.384 align:middle line:84%
been captured,
they crashed here,

00:29:03.384 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:84%
or they volunteered
to be here regardless.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And they feel much safer
working in the projects

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
underground than
ever going topside.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were
visiting another planet,

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
turmoil on the topside,

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and now your face has already
been exposed to the government

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and military, and you're
an extraterrestrial,

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:84%
it's not safe for them to be
up there once they're exposed.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have-- the
agenda is that they

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
want to stay down there.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.110 align:middle line:84%
They want to help us
with these technologies.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:84%
They want to further
our life expansion

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.214 align:middle line:90%
and clean up the planet.

00:29:41.214 --> 00:29:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you
pick up anything

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:84%
about their spirituality, their
belief in a god, what they do?

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I learned
some different sciences

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.940 align:middle line:90%
that I was not familiar with.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.235 align:middle line:90%
And it was really--

00:29:55.235 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I kind of already had
this belief system.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But the best way I could put
it is that we're forever,

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and there's not really--

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
there's a death, like
a physical death,

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:90%
but you don't really ever die.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of you
that is energetic,

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:84%
whether you call it
the soul or the spirit,

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and it goes on, and
on, and on, and on.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And there is a little
bit of control over that,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of where you choose to
go in that next lifetime.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.156 align:middle line:84%
So they believe in
this foreverness.

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And they also
believe in longevity.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So, if you choose to live a
couple thousand years, you can.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:90%
They have that choice.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't, because we fall
under this horrible control

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:84%
program of being
diseased and sick,

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
anyone living over 135

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.920 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, which we could
easily live a few hundred more

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
years with the
technology we have

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and the medical technologies
that we have that's

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:90%
being suppressed.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you like
them as individuals?

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.415 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I've never
met one that I did not like.

00:31:03.415 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did
they get placed

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:84%
into some of these
positions to work on some

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:90%
of this incredible technology?

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did they do--
they didn't just pop up.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, wherever
they came from,

00:31:12.545 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:84%
however they got into the
project and conversed with some

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
of the leaders in
there, they know--

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
"oh, he's really good
with engineering,

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:90%
with propulsion units."

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.970 align:middle line:84%
"He's really good with
the anti-gravitic stuff."

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:90%
"He's really good with biology."

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:84%
"He's really good
with genetics."

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they already
have a predisposition

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and lots of training,
these extraterrestrials,

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:84%
where they can be
multifaceted and put

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:90%
into many different positions.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.065 align:middle line:84%
They might be working,
helping reverse engineer

00:31:39.065 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:84%
a craft one day, and
then the next day they're

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%
in the operating room.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
interesting dynamic.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:90%
They have many different skills.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I've never learned,
from any of them,

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:84%
how they actually got
there, from step one

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.610 align:middle line:90%
all the way to being next to me.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But all I know is they had
many different job positions

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:90%
that they could fill.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, thanks for
sharing this information.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You're welcome, George.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This is
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.980 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:10%
government agencies, the
military and secret space

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:10%
programs--

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Oh, we're probably a
few million, that I'm aware of,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:10%
that are constantly
coming and going, though.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They have the ability to
climb up walls and on ceilings.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the information I
have has had to do with genetic

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:38.890 align:middle line:84%
code being pretty much the
currency of the universe.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:48.342 align:middle line:90%
