>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired Special Agent

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.570 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.370 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Today we are
discussing your work

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
at the Institute
for Advanced Studies

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and other relationships.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you worked at the
Institute of Advanced Studies

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:90%
back in 1994, correct?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what kind of
work were you doing there?

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Well, I met
Dr. Hal Puthoff,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:10%
who was the director
of the Institute

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:10%
for Advanced Studies
at Austin at a seminar.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:10%
And he knew of me before
because of Kit Green,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:10%
who I'd worked with in the
intelligence community.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Kit introduced me to Hal.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Big names there.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And so Hal asked
me to work for him.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided in
1994 that I would

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
go to work in a part-time basis
at first with Dr. Puthoff.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Dr.
Hal Puthoff was

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:84%
involved with many, of course,
high-level programs and UAP

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you
could tell us about that?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And what was your role in that?

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, Dr. Puthoff
at the Institute down there,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
he was intimately involved
with DARPA projects

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and other projects, primarily
dealing with energy.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
He had a theory that energy
devices, both ET and maybe

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
ours in the future,
could operate in what

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:90%
he called zero-point energy.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:90%
And so he was involved in that.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:84%
He asked me to be a
field investigator,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
to go out and
collect data that he

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
needed to advance to his
research in his laboratories.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:84%
He also asked me to interface
with the US intelligence

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
agencies and other agencies
within the United States

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
And I agreed to do that.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, what three-letter
agencies did you actually

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.957 align:middle line:90%
work with as a liaison?

00:02:14.957 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I interfaced
with the Central Intelligence

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.365 align:middle line:84%
Agency, both current
employees and past employees.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
talk about that.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
My first-- actually
first project

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
involved interfacing with
one of the former directors

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Also, I interfaced with DIA.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I had contacts within the DIA.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
people that Dr. Puthoff

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
knew within these agencies,
CIA, DIA, and DARPA,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:90%
that Hal introduced me to.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So I had contacts within
those different agencies

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:90%
and also within DARPA.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So I maintained
contacts and learned of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and was introduced
to new contacts

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
with these
intelligence agencies,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to obtain
information that they

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
could share with
me that would help

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.305 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Puthoff in his research.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And who
was the director

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of the CIA at that time?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In 1994, it was under
the Clinton administration.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have contact
with that particular person.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: My first project
was to make contact and get

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:10%
information from
Richard Helms, who

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:10%
was a former director
of Central Intelligence

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:10%
Agency some years ago.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:10%
The first time I
met Richard Helms

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:10%
was that at an Aviary meeting.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think I mentioned on
one of the "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%
episodes, it was about 1980.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:90%
He came into the meeting.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't director of the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
anymore, but once you're
connected with the intelligence

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
community, you're always
connected, and especially

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:90%
if you were the director.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I met him.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I became friends with him.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
He just seemed to take
me under his wing.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:84%
He shared a lot of
information with me back then.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So I called him up and made
contact with Richard Helms.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And over the period
of several months,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
he introduced me to
some other people.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But he shared a
lot of information

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:84%
with me regarding the Central
Intelligence Agency's role

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
within the investigation and
categorization of information

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:90%
regarding ETs and UFOs.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did Mr. Helms
tell you about the ETs and UFOs?

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In 1959, while he was
a young intelligence officer,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Richard Helms was introduced
to the subject of UFOs.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
There was an incident
on his watch--

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:90%
he was a station chief--

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that involved
extraterrestrial contact.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he was briefed
in to the program.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And his briefing is almost
similar to my briefing.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
The first part of the briefing
involved the first contacts

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
that we had with an
extraterrestrial race.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And that was a Roswell incident.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
He told me all about how he
was briefed into the Roswell

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
incident and into the crash
sites at Corona and Magdalena,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and same information that
I had been briefed into.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, he went in
more details about what the CIA

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:90%
role was in collecting it.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA's role was
more foreign collection

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:90%
than domestic collection.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he talked about other
contacts with extraterrestrials

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:90%
that the CIA was involved with.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And most of them were overseas.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
He talked about an
incident that occurred

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:90%
in Norway, northern Norway.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:90%
There's a NATO base up there.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was a contact
there that he told me about.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
was in 1956 or '57

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that the CIA became
involved with.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Their case officers
went out and contacted

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
the people that observed this
landing up in northern Norway.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And back in those days,
there was always a threat

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
that a UFO was something
of a Soviet aircraft, maybe

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
a new design or an
experimental craft

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:90%
that the Soviets were flying.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And so at that time
period, the CIA

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
was relatively new then,
because they came into existence

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:90%
in 1947.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So they were the new people
on the block, so to speak.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
gather as much intelligence

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
as they could during those
days, especially regarding

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
the threat of
extraterrestrial contact

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
or what then in the early days
most of the CIA scientists

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
thought were possibly
Soviet spacecrafts.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And so he briefed me on many
other different incidents that

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
happened, some inside
the Soviet Union,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
some inside Eastern Bloc
countries, some inside China,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.390 align:middle line:84%
information that was gathered
by the Central Intelligence

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.357 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you elaborate
what happened in Norway

00:06:57.357 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
on that briefing?

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.257 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the only
thing he told me was it

00:07:00.257 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
was a landing of a UFO at a
NATO base in northern Norway.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
There was a contact with one
extraterrestrial, got out

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:90%
of the craft.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't describe any
particular other details other

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
than there was an interface
between the extraterrestrial

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and a NATO member.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the NATO member
was a Norwegian Air Force

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:90%
member.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was an interface,
and the CIA investigated that.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know any
more details in that.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
More or less what he
gave me was summaries

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
of what he knew about the
UFO phenomena within the CIA

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.468 align:middle line:90%
back in those days.

00:07:37.468 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And was there
a lot of information

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that he shared with you
that you were unaware of?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Oh, yes, almost
everything that he talked about

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
regarding the CIA contacts with
ET races and incidents within

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:84%
inside East Germany at
Leipzig and inside Russia near

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
a particular place in
Latvia and so forth--

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I knew nothing of
those sightings.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I was never briefed into them.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So I was very
interested in hearing

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
what he had to say about that.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in 1994 when I first
regained contact with him,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:90%
I was out of intelligence then.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But I was very interested
in what he knew.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And he shared a
lot of information

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
with me, not in
a lot of details,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
but he told me the
CIA was very involved

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.115 align:middle line:84%
in the subject of the UFO
phenomena during his time in.

00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In what way, then,
did the CIA and the Institute

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:90%
of Advanced Studies--

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:90%
what was that connection then?

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.865 align:middle line:90%
What was their main role?

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, there
was a lot of things

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Puthoff was doing
in that I wasn't aware of

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't briefed into.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And he was
interfacing with a lot

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of different agencies regarding
technology and research.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was my job to
go out and interface

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and try to get contacts within
these different agencies.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Like he wanted me to interface
with a certain other person

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
within the CIA, who is
currently in the CIA,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that I can't mention his name,
but because that person was

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
a field operative who
had a lot of information

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:84%
about technology,
and that's primarily

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:84%
what Dr. Puthoff wanted
was technology, information

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.020 align:middle line:84%
about technology or
advanced research

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:90%
that the CIA might be doing.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want
me to go out and try

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to spy on the CIA or
anything like this.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I
wanted to do would

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:84%
have to be agreeable
to the person

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.358 align:middle line:90%
that I was making contact with.

00:09:40.358 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: While Puthoff was
getting all this information

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
from all these agencies,
all these events,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
what was he doing
with that information?

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.658 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go to from there?

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't privy to that.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was--

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Puthoff was working
hand to hand with DARPA.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: So DARPA had
a special section that

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:10%
dealt with exotic technology.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't
name it UFOs or ET.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:90%
It was Exotic Technologies.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And they had companies.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, DARPA, which I'm
going to talk about later,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
but DARPA was an
agency that controlled

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
advanced research
and development.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted other places--

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
have the scientists,

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
but they wanted other
companies, other entities

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:84%
within the research community,
to look at what they have

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and give them the ideas on
what or how this research could

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:90%
be developed or understood.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where Dr.
Puthoff's Institute came in.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So, and I'm not really sure
how that all interfaced.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wasn't
briefed into everything

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Puthoff was doing.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there was
a place where he sent

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:90%
his information, his research.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it remained
there at the laboratory.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to
reverse engineer things

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:90%
at the Institute, too.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible that Hal
Puthoff would receive devices,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:84%
parts of craft, or whatever
it was, and then it

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
was up to maybe him to say we
keep this and study this, maybe

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
this needs to go to
DARPA, this needs

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to go to Raytheon,
other corporations.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, you
know, he probably did.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
proprietary information,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and I can't really share
because I was briefed in.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, in some
respects that's true.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But most of what
he was getting, he

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:84%
was contracted to
do certain things.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't doing anything outside
the realms of his own work.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he wasn't a
maverick, so to speak.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
He had contracts and so
forth with companies,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:90%
way beyond my knowledge of it.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did
Mr. Helms talk to you

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
about with the reverse
engineering of ET craft,

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:90%
of different ET tools?

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, he had
a lot of information

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.480 align:middle line:90%
about what the CIA knew then.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this is
back in the '60s and '70s.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:84%
They certainly had-- he
called them trinkets.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:90%
He said, we obtain trinkets.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:90%
That was this famous term.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
He would always use
the word "trinkets."

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned, the
more I got to know him,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that the "trinkets" meant
coming from the ETs.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- the CIA
had contacts that weren't

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:90%
shared with other agencies.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And they obtained
information and trinkets

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
where they didn't share
with other agencies.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was hoping that
he would open up with me

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.945 align:middle line:84%
and tell me what
these trinkets were.

00:12:55.945 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Elaborate a little
bit what does "trinket" mean.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exactly, but,
you know, there's

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
things that he wouldn't
or couldn't say.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I'm not really
sure what those trinkets were

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:90%
or what they were used for.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
But one interesting
thing about Richard Helms

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is-- and I mentioned this
before in an episode--

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:84%
he was the original
Falcon in the Aviary.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And so he was only known by a
few people within the Aviary.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Hal Puthoff was
a member of the Aviary,

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and he was aware of
Richard Helms' position

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
within the Aviary and
how the Aviary fit

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:90%
into Dr. Puthoff's laboratory.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible to say
that captive extraterrestrials

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:90%
fall into "trinkets?"

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I took that some of the
references to "trinkets" used

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:84%
by Richard Helms meant captured
ETs, not anything that was here

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:90%
as a gift.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Because he mentioned many
times that hostilities

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:84%
were always prevalent when
an ET contact was made.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:90%
He didn't elaborate.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But I took it to
mean that there were

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:90%
incidents where we captured.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.928 align:middle line:90%
And this is me saying this.

00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:90%
This isn't him saying it.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But I took it to mean
that there were incidents

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that either the CIA or some
military entity captured an ET

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and then somehow the
CIA got custody of it.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what do they
do with these captured ETs?

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Where do they take them or
interrogate them or put them

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:90%
in cells?

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.633 align:middle line:90%
What do they do with them?

00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, all he
told me, the only mention

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I ever made was, if you captured
one, what would you do with it?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:90%
He said we had places to put.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
was out of Area 51.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Because from the early
'50s up until 1975 or 1976,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:90%
the CIA owned Area 51.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Air Force
used it, but the facility

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
was owned by the Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do these captured
extraterrestrials ever

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
end up in the laboratory
of Dr. Hal Puthoff?

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I never saw one there,
but I know of an incident

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
where scientists that
worked with Dr. Puthoff

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.830 align:middle line:84%
at the laboratory went
to another location

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to examine not just
an ET, it was a body,

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:39.370 align:middle line:84%
but what they had
in its possession.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't there,
so I don't know what,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't go
with the scientists,

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:90%
but I knew they did.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.180 align:middle line:90%
I knew they went.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:84%
There was an
occasion in the '90s

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:90%
where they went to examine one.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
were there to examine

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
the artifacts or the objects,
the devices, that the ET--

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:90%
they recovered with the ET.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that was verified
by two of your colleagues.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other projects
relating to the Institute

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:90%
were you part of?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I went to it on
a trip to South Dakota

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
to speak to a rancher
about possible debris

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.245 align:middle line:84%
that he'd recovered
from a crash UFO site.

00:16:17.245 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had learned
from various sources

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
within the
intelligence community

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that in 1970 an object landed
or crashed near a ranch

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
in or around Spearfish,
South Dakota.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And this was in
1970, winter of 1970.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was in
December of 1970.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Personnel from Ellsworth Air
Force base in South Dakota

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
sent a recovery team
and recovered the debris

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:90%
at the crash site.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%
But it was wintertime.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
snow on the ground.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometime in the spring, the
rancher and another worker

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
went out to this crash site,
and at springtime all the snow

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:90%
was gone, and found some debris.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And this rancher
kept the debris.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And a reporter from a
newspaper sometime later--

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and now this is in
1994 that I did this--

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.269 align:middle line:84%
spoke to him about
the crash site.

00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:90%
Did you know--

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did
the reporter know?

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.233 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Something crashed.

00:17:16.233 --> 00:17:22.746 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force put out a false
disinformation story about a--

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No, they
would never do that.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They sent out-- they
put out a story in the 1970s

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that some kind of a pod
fell off a B-52 bomber--

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and they had B-52s
at Ellsworth--

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and it crashed near
this rancher's farm.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:90%
And so that was the story.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:84%
The reporter thought there
might have been more to it,

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:84%
but the rancher never told
the reporter anything other

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.290 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't out there.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force came in,
cleaned it up, and left.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And that was basically it.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a
MUFON investigator

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
out of South Dakota
that I had contact

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:90%
with through Bill Moore.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And this MUFON
investigator thought--

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
well, had reason to believe,
talking to other witnesses,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:84%
that it was a UFO that
crashed near Spearfish.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And so an intelligence
agency, DIA, then I

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
learned through a source within
DIA that it was, in fact, a UFO

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and that they thought
there might still

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
be some debris there.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:90%
So then I went to South Dakota.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I went to the crash
site because I

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
had the GPS coordinates on it.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing left
there that I could see.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Then I went and
contact the rancher.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And he was very old.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Most of my dealings was with his
son, interfaced with his son.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I
said, did you guys

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:84%
ever go out and find
anything that was left out

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:90%
of that crash site?

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, we
have a souvenir.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, you kept a souvenir?

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, but I'm
not telling the Air Force.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.673 align:middle line:84%
It's our property, and
whatever lands here is ours.

00:19:07.673 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't argue
with him, you know.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not any longer in the
government or federal agency

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
did you ever consider

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that that could be dangerous,
radioactive or something?

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, we don't
keep it in the house.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.355 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, well
can I look at it?

00:19:27.355 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had a credential showing
I worked for the Institute

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:90%
for Advanced Studies.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I explained to him that we
were interested in this thing,

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and we were interested
in any kind of debris,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and we'd like to
just to look at it

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and maybe examine it if it's
from an extraterrestrial site.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And the sone said, well,
the Air Force is saying

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:90%
it was from a B-52 bomber.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I was
in the Air Force once,

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and if it came out of a B-52--

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
now, most of this wasn't
actually true-- but I said,

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I could probably identify it and
say, yeah, this is from a B-52

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:90%
or this wasn't from a B-52.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, they claimed
there was a pod on a B-52

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that the pilots used
as a targeting system

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and that's what landed.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, I'm
familiar with that.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And I actually was.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's what's
called an MSQ-81 system.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a bombing site.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a target system.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he said, OK.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:90%
So I got into a--

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
he started believing what
I was saying, most of which

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
was truth, and
some of it was just

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.205 align:middle line:84%
made up because I was
trying to get into it.

00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll
show it to you.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So he went out to a place,
another section of the house,

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.825 align:middle line:90%
went down in the basement.

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go down there with
him, but he brought up a box,

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:90%
and he opened the box up.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, he
brings out this object,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:90%
which I knew what it was.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:84%
It was about 24 inches
long, about six inches wide,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and about two inches thick.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear, like a
hard piece of Plexiglas,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
with a border, a hard, thick,
black border around it.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd seen this before,
because it was the energy

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
device found in the
ET craft in 1947

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that I seen at the Institute
that Hal Puthoff had tried

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what it was.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.745 align:middle line:84%
And he was convinced it
was zero-point energy.

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I looked at that
thing, and I told him,

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.453 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, I think
that's an energy device.

00:21:31.453 --> 00:21:33.373 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that point
he didn't believe me.

00:21:33.373 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're blowing
smoke at me now,

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.082 align:middle line:90%
because I don't believe--

00:21:36.082 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, no,
seriously, I think

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
this is some kind
of ET energy device.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We'd like to be
able to examine it.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I started talking to him
about how the Institute could

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
come up and examine it, or if
you would let me take it back

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I would certainly-- or we could
probably even pay him for it.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wasn't
authorized to say that.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But I figured if
Dr. Puthoff knew

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
this was an energy
device he'd say,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll dish out some
money or maybe we'll

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
get DARPA or somebody else
to dish out some money.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're not taking it.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.238 align:middle line:90%
You can examine it.

00:22:10.238 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:90%
You can do everything you want.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So I took pictures,
a lot of pictures.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I tried to scrape some stuff
off it, but I couldn't.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would scrape off.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I'll agree as
long as I can be there.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:84%
If you guys want to
send your scientists up,

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I will sit down
with them and let

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
them do whatever they
need to do with it,

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to be there.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, fair enough.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.107 align:middle line:90%
So I flew back to the Institute.

00:22:36.107 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And they made arrangements, and
they sent scientists up there.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go with them.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But they went up
there, and what they found out

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.985 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, is obviously
proprietary from that point on.

00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you
think these artifacts are

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.055 align:middle line:90%
so significant to the agencies?

00:22:51.055 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because they're
extraterrestrial in nature.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And they want to try to
advance our technology,

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
try to understand,

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could
somewhat reverse it.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the CIA had
scientists, especially there

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
in the early stages, primarily
foreign intelligence,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.740 align:middle line:84%
foreign technology, that they
were trying to understand,

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
the Soviets and the Chinese
and the Eastern Bloc countries'

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:84%
If they could obtain
something extraterrestrial

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and reverse engineer it and
use it against our enemies,

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.020 align:middle line:90%
that would be one step up.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
that has happened?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.463 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I'm convinced
that's happened.

00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:84%
I am thoroughly convinced,
and I've seen things

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that I can't talk about
that would convince me

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.430 align:middle line:84%
without a shadow of a
doubt that we have reverse

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
engineered some things and now
we have them in our arsenal.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I agree with you, Rick.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:84%
We went from so horse and
buggy to landing on the moon

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:90%
so quickly.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And looking just at
a plasma TV screen

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and infrared goggles, we're
not that smart, are we?

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, and I think
Lieutenant Colonel Phil

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Corso was absolutely, 100%
right about what he did.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now unfortunately
he passed away.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's other
people coming forth now

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and the low-level people saying,
I worked with Colonel Corso

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
in the Pentagon or I went
with him at a certain place.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
in the end, we're

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
going to find out that what
Lieutenant Colonel said

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
about the reverse
engineering, things

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
that he was responsible
for, is accurate.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
that we have craft that

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:90%
can fly with zero-point energy?

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think
that we have crafts

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that utilize zero-point
energy for the electricity

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:90%
or the power system.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.067 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the
anti-gravitic unit?

00:24:55.067 --> 00:24:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, but
I'm not sure if it's

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:84%
the actual propulsion
system that

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.180 align:middle line:90%
is using the zero-point energy.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But I'm almost convinced
that it's in power systems.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy device
that we got from the ETs

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and from other crash
sites is a power system.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like an electrical
generator, so to speak.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:84%
It'll power anything
from a little light bulb

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:90%
up to a city and beyond.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And that gives the craft,
an ET craft, the power.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the propulsion system
might be something different.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a technical
person, and I was never

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:90%
briefed on any of that.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
the power system--

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I know they're in crafts.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, do
we have craft that

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
can fly off planet using
these reverse-engineered

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:90%
technologies?

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I can't officially say
that my past experience or past

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:84%
work where I saw one
or had access to it,

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
but my unofficial beliefs
is that, yes, we do.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
We do have crafts that can fly
with either anti-matter or some

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:90%
exotic--

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what it
is, but some exotic ET

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:90%
reverse technology.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I saw a craft fly
when I was at Area 51.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't a
conventional craft.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It was able to do things
that a F-117 or a F-35

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
or a F-22 or a U2 or
any other plane that we

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.780 align:middle line:90%
had in our arsenal could do.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And although no one
actually told me, I mean,

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I could put two and two
together and figure that that

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.060 align:middle line:90%
had to be reverse engineered.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what I was told
is that was one of ours.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
system is it using?

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, we got
it from a friend.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.642 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, putting two and
two together, yeah, we did.

00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I saw something fly that
I couldn't understand.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And Bob Lazar
talked about things.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And I believe--
obviously I was at S-2.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:90%
He calls it S-4.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:90%
S-4 is the underground facility.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:90%
S-2 is the whole complex.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a
difference of how you name it.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But when he talked to me
and told me what he did

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly how
you got into the facility,

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.447 align:middle line:90%
I knew he had been there.

00:27:31.447 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you
have other colleagues

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that collaborate with
your opinion on this

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:90%
that you have spoke to?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Many,
including scientists

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and including personnel
at the Institute

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that had knowledge above mine
and the technical knowledge

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and technical experience that I
didn't have that told me, yeah,

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
we have crafts that can
do things like that.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, once again,
fascinating information.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:90%
You're always a wealth of intel.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.182 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:28:06.182 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
