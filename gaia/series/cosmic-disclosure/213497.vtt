>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:10%
we're with former US
Marine Mike Herrera.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
Distinguished Service record.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
Today, we discuss craft
retrieval programs.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE HERRERA: Hey,
it's good to be back on.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.798 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do we know about
crash retrieval programs, Mike?

00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, I think
mainstream is starting to get

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, disclosure
wise, because people

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
have the question on how we're
obtaining these materials, which

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
is a very good question
for the public to ask.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, without my involvement
in understanding how this works,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I had the same questions.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming
from somebody who

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.177 align:middle line:84%
had a background, who didn't
believe in this kind of stuff

00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:56.157 align:middle line:90%
prior to my experience.

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
the things, how were

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
they able to pull this off?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, how often do
UFO and UAP crashes occur?

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now, my personal
knowledge stems from this

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:90%
facility that I went to.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.122 align:middle line:84%
This facility, I know, at least
happens two to three times

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
a year where they're doing
crash retrieval operations

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and there are AO,
Area of Operations.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is done
through P3 assets

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that are luring these
craft in through a level

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:90%
They are making contact.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.838 align:middle line:84%
This is a very advanced level
of what people know as CE-5.

00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have to go
into a meditative state

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.422 align:middle line:84%
to do that, they
can do it instantly.

00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:90%
They can just think about it.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's how this happens.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So over time, they're building
rapport and this organization

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that has control
of these P3 assets

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
are sitting off in a distance
with these weapon systems

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
that they have, which is
scalar longitudinal weapons

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're basically
stunning these craft

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and bringing them down.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing I also
found out, which is interesting,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
is these P3s are
getting to a point--

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is also assisted with
extraterrestrial technology

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
or non-human intelligence--
that they can actually

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
hijack these craft
and block the ETs

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
or the non-human intelligence
that are onboard these

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
so they can intercept that
and take control of the craft

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:90%
and bring it down.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.543 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, let's
talk about that,

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:84%
because if these craft and these
civilizations are so advanced,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.963 align:middle line:90%
like how can we shoot them down?

00:02:25.963 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I think it's a
lot of them being tricked

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's not like, you know,
when they come to our world,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
they are susceptible to our laws
of physics, such as gravity,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:84%
such as inertia, such
as things like that.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.983 align:middle line:84%
The only benefit they have
as far as their technology is

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
that they're able to have
a bubble that they have

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
their craft in that actually
bypasses all those laws,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
which is why people see
them traveling few thousand

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:84%
all the way to up to a hundred
thousand miles an hour.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And they've had documented cases
through radar signatures that

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
have done this, back
in the '50s in a way,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:84%
because now they
switched that up.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So they become
subject to our laws

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
also with consciousness
to an extent.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So if they have people
that are able to be

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
on a similar level to them with
this technology assisting them

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to do so, which
is how this works,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:84%
then they're able to
hijack these craft.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And they also-- maybe there's
something that happens off

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
in the distance where, OK, this
isn't working because maybe

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.063 align:middle line:84%
these specific
beings happen to be

00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
at a higher level
of consciousness

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:90%
that we understand.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
implement plan B, which would

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.980 align:middle line:90%
be scalar longitudinal weapons.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you're telling me
these P3s are actually weapons?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They're trained to--

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.665 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: They're
trained to do this.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, you said
they take over the craft.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Are they also taking over
the extraterrestrial's

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No, though
specifically the craft,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
because that is how they
pilot the craft is through

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.777 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
levers and controls.

00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
When people think that, I mean,
these reverse-engineered craft,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
they may have devices where
the occupants such as these P3s

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.262 align:middle line:84%
connect to the craft in that
way that not normal people can.

00:04:01.262 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know that they've had
technologies where people

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.863 align:middle line:90%
put this technology on them.

00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It may be something that
goes over their head,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:84%
it may be a vest of some
sort that actually amplifies

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness to where
they can connect to that craft.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And now they have
the archaic versions

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:84%
which actually have lever
systems and things like that.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
these days is it's

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
getting very hard to
tell the difference

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
between non-human intelligence,
such as their craft and ours,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.823 align:middle line:84%
because it's basically
leveled together.

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
It's now to the point where
it's hard to distinguish

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that because now they look
like they're manufactured

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:90%
in one solid piece.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:90%
They're not having the--

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:90%
like the one I saw in 2009--

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah, the one you saw.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: --which had rivets,
had seams, it had panels,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of stuff.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It wasn't seamless.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No, these are
starting to become that way.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are the P3s
specifically trained for just

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.545 align:middle line:84%
one civilization, one race
of craft, or is it multitude?

00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: It's multitude.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:90%
It's across the board.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is, is
they're at a basic level

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
of understanding and helping
with this assistive technology

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.048 align:middle line:84%
that they're given,
which is being--

00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
obviously they're being
controlled by these operatives.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what people
have to understand.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like we've
talked about before,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
A, being of Black team operator;
B, being a sonic person; and C,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.107 align:middle line:90%
being this AT and ET craft.

00:05:13.107 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have a machine that
they plug into this person that

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:90%
can connect to this craft.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Right,
through the secondary--

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.833 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
you're controlling me.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And if I have access
to a craft, then you're

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
controlling me to move
this thing and do it.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
you're doing it

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:84%
instead of having somebody
else do it for you.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily just
one specific race that they're

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:90%
actually tuned into.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:90%
It's across the board.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
familiarity with these people

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and these P3s connecting
to similar beings that may

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:90%
come from the same star system.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think when they have that
perfected, then all of a sudden

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
they're having to train or
maybe augmented in a way

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to deal with other civilizations
that we may not have come across

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:90%
on the back end.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you aware of
what specific races the P3s are

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:90%
working on in this program?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: With
some of my sources,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
it's mainly Greys that
they've interacted with.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.887 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just the
ones that are 3 feet tall.

00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
There's some that are
actually are our same height

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and there's some instances where
some of these are 10 feet tall,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.125 align:middle line:84%
very large beings in
comparison as far as tall-wise.

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.708 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now, because some of
these facilities have taken them

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to these operators have
worked on the genetic level

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.062 align:middle line:84%
of basically understanding
what these are,

00:06:20.062 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they're
determining whether they

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
actually have digestive systems
that we've talked about,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.780 align:middle line:84%
as well as beings
that don't have that,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
which can conclude the
hypothesis that maybe these are

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.600 align:middle line:84%
some advanced drones that
they have and that's why

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
they're sending in these craft.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So there is definitely
a lot of knowledge

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
being learned between what
races are coming up against.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know the Greys
for the most part,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
from what I've been
briefed on, look

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:84%
more humanoid than
they do like how they

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:90%
have in movies and cartoons.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
There are some iteration of
that, but a lot of these beings

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
look more humanoid
with facial features

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:84%
compared to what's
being illustrated.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned these
P3s basically bring down these

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.785 align:middle line:84%
What's the protocol after
that for the crash retrieval?

00:07:03.785 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It's
a good question.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
So this is how it works.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's very basic and it
stems from the military side

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of these
operators are former military--

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.127 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go into specifics

00:07:14.127 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:90%
with that special operations--

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:84%
but what they do is
they secure the area

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:90%
that this is going on to.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a
security presence,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
basically keeps everybody out.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they have the aspect
of the actual crash retrieval

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
teams such as
HAZMAT, because they

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
have to make sure that the area
that they're in when there's

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
a crash retrieval
being done is not

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
toxic to any of the members that
could instantly incapacitate

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
There are instances that I
am aware of where they've

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
done crash retrieval operations,
where the craft has actually

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
zapped people and has
rendered them unconsciousness.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
As far as an extent of being
lethal, I'm not entirely sure,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
but I've heard
that this happens.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
the energy output.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's intentional.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It is.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:90%
It's the energy from the craft.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.793 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:07:58.793 --> 00:08:00.155 align:middle line:90%
And I've hypothesized that.

00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's intentional,

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:90%
but I've heard that it's--

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's the
Travis Walton syndrome.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: That's exactly it.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So Travis Walton,
for example, we

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
all know, at least on
the backend of things,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:90%
people in disclosure--

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.453 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Of course.

00:08:11.453 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: He sold his
story for very cheap.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And they turned
it into something

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that was more of a
fear-mongering basis.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't
understand-- and he's also

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
went on publicly to say
this, that they actually

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.640 align:middle line:90%
helped heal him.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.510 align:middle line:84%
They didn't do horrible
experiments on him.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.910 align:middle line:84%
They didn't put
anything in his eyeball

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.077 align:middle line:90%
like they say in that movie.

00:08:28.077 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They actually helped
him heal and made

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
sure that he was able
to regain his health.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: He told us that he--

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
it was his fault. He ran
right up to the craft

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and it shocked him
and stopped his heart.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yep.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And they
brought him back.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:90%
They helped him out.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's, you know,
so if they were bad,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
like they illustrated
in this movie,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't be here right now.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%
You know that as well as I do.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.413 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: But they're
not here to harm us.

00:08:49.413 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm relieved of that.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We've had happen on
many crash retrievals where

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
people that are not trained in
approaching a craft get zapped

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.643 align:middle line:84%
And they have a protocol
where they actually

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
keep that a distance to make
sure that nobody's getting--

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I guess that's really
important, what you said,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
is the first people that go out
there secure that barrier around

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:84%
the craft to protect everyone or
onlookers or whoever's around.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: That's exactly it.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.605 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have-- let's say
if you have kids playing nearby

00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and this happens to happen
during that time of day,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:90%
it spans.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not just nighttime.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you explain to
them, because I'm aware of this,

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure they
would want to know,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
you know how they do
multiple barriers,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and how far does that
go out from the craft?

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So it
can be up to a mile.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.658 align:middle line:90%
It can be even excess of that.

00:09:36.658 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But most of the controlled
area is within a mile.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is also topside,
too, with airspace.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So they're keeping this vector
on with keeping everybody out.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's only
people who are read up

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.638 align:middle line:84%
on this who are going to
be in these areas that

00:09:48.638 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:90%
do this operation firsthand.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It's experienced people.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
You have pilots
who actually have

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and they pick up
the wreckage using

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
helicopters or any
other means to do that,

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:90%
to bring it to a facility.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So they hook everything
up in that way.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is also instances
where nobody's damaged

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually just
falls and there's no--

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
some of these craft
are very durable.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So when they impact the
soil, they're not destroyed.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a hole
rupturing the hull, for example.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
they basically have

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
these P3s that are basically
bringing and moving

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:84%
the craft to a
location or to an area

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.457 align:middle line:84%
to where they can be snagged
up by these operators.

00:10:27.457 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you show the
audience and give us a kind

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
of a measurement, because you
and I both know it could be like

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
right here that we shot down
craft from Nellis Air Force base

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and it lands in
the Atacama Desert.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Could you give them like,
what's the distances

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that the farthest or the
nearest that's happened at that

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
point where the
P3 was getting it?

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It spans a couple--
it could be a couple hundred

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
miles.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.382 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Now they've refined
their technology because some

00:10:57.382 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
of the scalar weapon systems
they use, it hits a band.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
They've refined it to where
it's surgical to an extent,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
but they're also
using other systems

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:90%
that may not be to that degree.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:90%
And it hits a fan.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is why there's
collateral damage

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
such as civilian
aircraft being hit, too,

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.762 align:middle line:84%
because it just happens
to be caught in the way.

00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
There's been crash retrievals
that have happened away

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
from this installation that have
spanned more than 100 miles.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And like you've talked
about, some of them

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:90%
have fallen in the ocean.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have fallen
in other remote places

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
in the world, even
South America.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So they have neutrino
light detectors

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that they have satellites
that pick up these propulsion

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.342 align:middle line:84%
systems on these
craft and they're

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
able to detect where
they're going to go.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
advanced systems

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.822 align:middle line:84%
that say, OK, the probability is
that this may have crashed here.

00:11:42.822 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So they already
have response teams

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
all over the world that
specialize in this.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a lot of cases
where people like in Virginia,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
for example, where they've
had C-130s rolling up

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.383 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously as soon
as this crash happened.

00:11:55.383 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they've had people that
have handled the biologics that

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:90%
have succumbed to--

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not familiar as
far as the specifics,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
as far as how these
people relatively

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
died from handling
the biologics,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
but it did harm
them in some way.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
a chemical or if it's

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
some type of other off
world material or substance

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
or anything that could
have been harmful to us.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of why they
have to score in this area off

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to make sure nobody's
getting hit by this.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you explain
to the audience, Mike,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
how there are these
teams out there,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
these crash retrieval teams,
how they're always in the air

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and the cost of they're always
around the planet just flying.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: They are.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.422 align:middle line:90%
And you have eventually--

00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
what people have to realize
is that this organization

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:90%
has an unlimited budget.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.865 align:middle line:84%
We talked about self-funding
mechanisms that they do.

00:12:47.865 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the funding
from the Black projects

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually
siphoning funds through,

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
money laundering and a bunch of
other ways that they do this.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So they always have
assets on standby.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are specific
operations that they do,

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
such as being bringing a
P3 asset to a remote area

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and
initiate this, which--

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And they're
prepared for that?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes, they are.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.802 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
basically have it more

00:13:10.802 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:90%
confined into that area.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about that
on a global scale.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're trying to bring
them so far down to where

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:90%
they're relatively close.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But what people, and I'm talking
about these organizations

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that also has an issue with
how big these craft are.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:84%
They've had instances where
they have these black pyramid

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:90%
structures that are craft.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know the race
specifically behind this

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:84%
that it has built
those, but they've

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
had giant black pyramids
that they've seen.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they
ever say, slow down,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:90%
we can't do this one because--

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: There's
been times where that--

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: it's going to
take out the whole city.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: There's been
times where that's happened.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.327 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of have to pick and
choose what they're going with.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they kind
of observe and they're

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.495 align:middle line:84%
able to get the P3 to actually
make contact with certain ones

00:13:53.495 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
to say, OK, they can
make the decision.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
If this P3 can't
handle it, then they

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
have these operators that can
target them and bring them down.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's been craft, like
I said, mothership size.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And I can't relatively
put in scale

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
on how big that is for
people to understand,

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:84%
but that's pretty
big to where it

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
would impact a certain part
of our world in a bad way.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Have you ever
heard of a P3 getting control

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:10%
of a vessel, a spacecraft,
a UFO/UAP in outer space,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:10%
and then the teams come in
and they kind of invade that

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.577 align:middle line:10%
and board and take out the,
well, the pilots and stuff?

00:14:34.577 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I have not
personally have heard that,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but I know that they're always
trying to test the range of how

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:90%
this person can operate.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So I assume that there
has been instances

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
where this has
happened and maybe it's

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
fallen, like you've said,
into the Atacama Desert

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
instead of in a
classified area out West.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you aware that
they ever took P3 in space

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:90%
and did that?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I'm
not aware of that.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.617 align:middle line:84%
It's possible, but I'm
not personally aware.

00:14:57.617 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, these
extraterrestrials are coming

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:90%
to our planet.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:90%
They're not attacking us.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
These P3s are gaining basically
control of their craft.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
shooting them down.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So these P3s
when they're doing this,

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
they're not doing it out of
a measure that's going to be

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:90%
hostile towards an ET.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They're making genuine contact
through other civilizations

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that are here that
have a friendly nature

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:90%
amongst themselves.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.013 align:middle line:84%
That's why these P3s
are being tricked

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
when these other-- because
they don't know these operators

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:90%
are going to do this.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.262 align:middle line:84%
And there may be a point
to where all of a sudden

00:15:36.262 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
it does that, that
the P3 will realize,

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
oh this craft was just shot
down by this other group

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.347 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
idea because they

00:15:42.347 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
keep them very compartmentalized
and not aware of anything else.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.117 align:middle line:84%
They just put them in this
area, have them do their magic,

00:15:49.117 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's when these
other forces basically

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.075 align:middle line:84%
take them down with these
advanced weapons systems.

00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, the P3s
as well as the ETs

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
or the non-human intelligence
are being tricked.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:90%
That is very real.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if they were
to be aware of it,

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.872 align:middle line:84%
let's say beforehand,
if they were to--

00:16:02.872 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They
would pick up on it.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: They would pick
up on it and they would leave

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:90%
the area.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't intervene
with that area.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And that does happen
quite a bit where

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
they pick up on it because
they've seen something happen.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Absolutely,
and during our CE-5s,

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
we have a few people have fear
in them or we have a couple

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
agents in there that wish harm,
they will immediately stop

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.290 align:middle line:90%
the contact.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yes, and
they're very hyper aware

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
of people's energy
in that regard.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, these P3s, they're
always taken care of.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.563 align:middle line:84%
They're always
given the luxury--

00:16:32.563 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They keep mapping.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes, they do.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.585 align:middle line:84%
So if they're feeling happy,
then the ETs are like,

00:16:36.585 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, this
person's obviously nice

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
going to happen.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.163 align:middle line:84%
We want to see who this person
is or interact with them.

00:16:42.163 --> 00:16:43.663 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That makes
complete sense.

00:16:43.663 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, that's how
this works and it's not a good

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:90%
thing, in my personal opinion.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of
people agree with that

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
because they're being tricked
and this is something that--

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:84%
let's say if we were to
come across a race that

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
didn't think too highly
of us and they decided

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to go to war.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, that war would
not last years.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing would be
over within a microsecond,

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:90%
if I think about it.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.057 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, what about all
these other extraterrestrial

00:17:09.057 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
races monitoring us, visualizing
what we're doing, this evilness?

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:90%
What are they thinking?

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, they
understand that there's a small

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:90%
group of people doing this.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.587 align:middle line:90%
It's not the whole human race.

00:17:20.587 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the whole human
race, the problem

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
is we have the
capability to do that

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
but people don't branch
on that capability.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
These people in these programs,
to an extent, the bad people,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
are fully bred with
that capability

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they're given
the materials to make them

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
more on that personality
trait of being

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:90%
sociopathic or psychopathic.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think one day
we will have to pay the price

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
not just traumatically but
as a physical planet here?

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I hope not, because
everybody else on this planet

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.807 align:middle line:84%
wants to have contact with
non-human intelligence.

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, you're
mentioning these malevolent

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
groups that are doing
all this trickery.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
groups or organizations

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
out there that are
benevolent, that are

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:90%
trying to do something good.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Are they working
together at all?

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No, that's
completely compartmentalized

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:90%
in that nature.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
What I will say
is that the people

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:84%
who have a genuine
curiosity are not going

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.018 align:middle line:90%
to be people in these programs.

00:18:18.018 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be the ones
who are people who are going out

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.895 align:middle line:84%
amongst the stars doing CE-5s,
trying to initiate contact

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:84%
with that way,
which, by the way,

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot of incredible
videos of this being done.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've had broad
experiences with this.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I have not.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to see
that one day, maybe I will.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But I know for a fact that
these malevolent groups

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
are doing it to gain the
technology aspect of it,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
to refine what they're already
doing or trying to capitalize

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.015 align:middle line:90%
on it to begin with.

00:18:48.015 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the malevolent
nature comes into effect.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
These P3s don't have
that malevolent nature.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
if that was really the case,

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:84%
these beings would pick
up on a much faster.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:90%
They would clear it.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know for a fact that
there may be malevolent P3s,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
but they probably don't have
as much success compared

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to somebody who is not.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
they trick them.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, are there other
organizations or governments out

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
there that are trying to make
safe contact that's benevolent

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.762 align:middle line:90%
that you're aware of?

00:19:18.762 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I'm
aware of that, yes.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.178 align:middle line:84%
And as far as US government
assets, I'm not sure of,

00:19:23.178 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
but I know foreign countries
that are doing this.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
this in the past

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
where they want to
make peaceful contact.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, these rogue
groups and our government

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.697 align:middle line:84%
are contacting them
and saying, hey, you're

00:19:32.697 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:84%
not allowed to do this
without our approval,

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
which who are they to say that
it's up to their approval?

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they want to
basically capitalize on this.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So peaceful contact
is being done.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:90%
By our government?

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not entirely sure.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
But I know foreign
governments that

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
are more on that level of
not wanting to retrieve

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
the technology, but just to
basically make friends and know

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
that they can contact them
and have peaceful contact

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.972 align:middle line:90%
is a real thing.

00:19:55.972 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Isn't it odd that
the US government does not want

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
other countries contacting
extraterrestrials without

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:90%
their permission?

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.783 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yeah, that's
a little weird, you know.

00:20:04.783 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But you have these
rogue groups that

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:84%
are controlling certain people
in the government to say this,

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's how that's
working, because I

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
know there's some people in
the government I've talked

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.585 align:middle line:84%
to that are curious about making
contact in a peaceful approach.

00:20:16.585 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.433 align:middle line:84%
How many craft do we know
that have been recovered?

00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That is kind
of a loaded question,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
but I will explain as in
there's different agencies,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
both conventional government
that perform crash retrievals.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
specific number of that.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
This deep Black
organization that's

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
doing crash retrievals
on a basis where

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:84%
it's not really known and
is kept very hush-hush,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:90%
it's been quite a bit.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
As well as the exact
number, I'm not sure of.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But to put in reference, I
do know the specific facility

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that was taken to has done
two to three times a year

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:90%
that they do this on average.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So at least guaranteed
two to three times a year

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
at this installation is having
these crash retrievals happen.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you're taking the
existence of this facility,

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:84%
which I cannot confirm
that existence,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to,
to keep people safe,

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.690 align:middle line:84%
when this facility started
being used for this purposes,

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:84%
as well as other things, because
these facilities are being used

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
in a multi-role function.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned
facilities, plural.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So where are these craft
being taken to be examined?

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Underground.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Most-- 99% of the time,
they're taken underground.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
There's only certain-- there's
only a certain percentage where

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't happen and it's
because they're too big to move.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is they build
a structure on top of it,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.183 align:middle line:84%
like a building
that's hollowed out,

00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and then they have
it cordoned off

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:84%
with security
measures, of course,

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
to make it look
like it's nothing.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not a fancy
building, but they

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
have workers inside basically
trying to examine this

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.103 align:middle line:84%
and trying to, you
know, I don't know

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
how they're going
to break it down

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.062 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the materials
that these craft are is almost

00:21:56.062 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:90%
virtually indestructible.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Even in the early
'90s when I was part of these

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
retrieval teams, they had these
amazing devices that they would

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:84%
put on the outside of these
craft that projected holographic

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
images, that there was really
nothing there from the horizon

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:90%
line of sight.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.992 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that
they still do that.

00:22:14.992 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Do they still have
stuff like this?

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes, they do that.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny you mentioned--

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: While they're building
the building and burying

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:90%
the craft and stuff.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.643 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yes, and they
actually obscure some of these

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:84%
black sites that same way
with holographic technologies.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they do that
during the P3 contact work from

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:90%
the satellites?

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: I would imagine so.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.275 align:middle line:84%
The specifics of
that, I don't know,

00:22:36.275 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
but I imagine they would because
they want to keep it obscured.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.442 align:middle line:84%
They want to keep
it where it doesn't

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
look like something's going on.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
some times where

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
it may hastily happen to where
they're not prepared for it.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So then they have to go
through the other manpower

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:84%
exercise of having a
threatening military force.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yeah, these projectors
are on giant semi-flatbeds.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're not brought
to a military bases?

00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.978 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Early on in the
'40s and '50s, they were.

00:23:01.978 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the government
was basically handing it

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.895 align:middle line:84%
to these private
companies to work out,

00:23:05.895 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
which then would take it into
these private installations.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, these other bases that used
to be military bases and they

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
may be disguised as
military bases to an extent,

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
but most of the time they
look like there's nothing

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:90%
going on topside.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
They look like
abandoned facilities.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But underground is where all
the specific fun happens,

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:84%
such as reverse engineering
programs and genetic materials,

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.845 align:middle line:84%
But what people also
have to understand

00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is that there are a lot
of underground facilities

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:90%
that don't ever come topside.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can only access
these installations

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.397 align:middle line:90%
through methods of underground.

00:23:38.397 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: From other facilities.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:40.563 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:23:40.563 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I can concur.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.375 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have any
extraterrestrials been recovered

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:90%
from these crash retrievals?

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.633 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what
they do with them?

00:23:48.633 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: There's different
SOPs or protocols for that,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:90%
standard operating procedures.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So if they have anything that's
alive, they typically, I think,

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:90%
will sedate them to an extent.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So they have teams specific
for non-human biologics that

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:90%
happen to deal with this.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as personally,
I have not witnessed this.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is only secondhand
information that I'm saying.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
But they do take them
into these facilities.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
kept alive, I don't

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
know what they do with
them when they're alive.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I do know that when they do
have dead occupants that they

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
recover, that they incinerate
the bodies after they're

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.410 align:middle line:90%
done doing any kind of--

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:84%
the question is,
what kind of species

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
is this and is it something
that they've already

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:90%
recovered in the past before?

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm pretty sure they just
go ahead and incinerate them

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:84%
because they know
everything about them.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like having to
keep getting something new.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's something where
they have a species or a race

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that they haven't
encountered before,

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.635 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to
start doing the testing

00:24:48.635 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and trying to basically see
what they're about genetically.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why would these
extraterrestrial races send live

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.983 align:middle line:84%
beings when they can easily send
a drone and a program life form.

00:25:00.983 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, that's
what they're already doing.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:90%
There's been a mixture of both.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think if it's an
intentional purpose

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to see what we do, kind of
sending a canary into the coal

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
mine, for example, to
see what kind of gases

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
are emitted from that, they're
doing kind of the same thing.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.313 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
they're putting things

00:25:16.313 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that may, to our understanding,
may look like live beings to us,

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
but in fact are maybe
these advanced drones.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So I know they do
that and I know

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to test
certain things to happen.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And that maybe for them trying
to have a gauge on how advanced

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:84%
we are as people
using this technology

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and how we're able
to intercept it.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.895 align:middle line:84%
So I know they're
constantly testing us

00:25:35.895 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:90%
through those measures.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What kind of
facilities are required

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.218 align:middle line:84%
to contain these
extraterrestrials?

00:25:41.218 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, it's
anything that is basically

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.978 align:middle line:84%
at a bio-genetic facility,
but more high-tech.

00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
something like at a college,

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
for example, that's doing
genetic testing for animals

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.367 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be facilities
that are basically

00:25:54.367 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:90%
almost impossible to get into.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being they keep
this is because, one, they

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
only allow the control of
certain people to go into this.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They know these
people very intimately

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
because that's how they either
coerce them or control them.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So they keep the
security measures very

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:90%
intact with doing it that way.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
In most of the
time, you will find

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that these genetic
facilities are only

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.180 align:middle line:84%
accessed from other
facilities underground.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
You can only go in one
way in and one way out.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of personnel there

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:84%
that basically
coordinate area off

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.163 align:middle line:84%
and they're very articulate
with biometrics as far

00:26:29.163 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:84%
as making sure this person
is who they say they are.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
They also measure them
their weight to make sure

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.953 align:middle line:84%
they're not bringing
anything in or out.

00:26:35.953 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
they started doing,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm pretty sure
you're well aware of this,

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.800 align:middle line:84%
is a frequency-based
systems that

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.615 align:middle line:90%
detect a person's frequency.

00:26:42.615 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And if they match that
frequency because it's

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
very hard to duplicate that,
then that specific person

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:90%
can go in.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like I
have access to all

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
these underground
facilities, but it's

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
like certain people who do
they measure them based off

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.785 align:middle line:84%
of a certain frequency
with biometric data.

00:26:56.785 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
What about the containment
of these extraterrestrials

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and these underground
facilities?

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So they keep them
basically with nitrogen freezers

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:84%
or like liquid nitrogen. So
that's kind of the cooling agent

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:90%
to basically keep them chilled.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it's anywhere from
negative-60 to negative-80.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.545 align:middle line:84%
So that way, they're
not completely frozen,

00:27:14.545 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
but they're still
able to actually make

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
incisions on their skins or
graft any kind of material

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.775 align:middle line:90%
that they need to.

00:27:20.775 --> 00:27:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about
the ones that are alive?

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: The ones that are
alive, I'm not entirely sure.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.722 align:middle line:84%
I was not read up on that
because a lot of these people

00:27:26.722 --> 00:27:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that I work with do not have
access to live occupants.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a different--
compartmentalized.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I end up
getting to know people

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
who do that, they will
pretty much tell me

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:84%
that this is how
it works and then

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.730 align:middle line:84%
we can revisit
that in the future.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:41.778 align:middle line:90%
Someday, hopefully.

00:27:41.778 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, what type of
non-human intelligence have been

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.653 align:middle line:90%
recovered that you can speak of?

00:27:45.653 --> 00:27:47.195 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Greys,
for the most part,

00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:49.330 align:middle line:84%
different races of Greys
that are more humanoid.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not the insect ones.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of the insectoids
even what they call mantis-like.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:90%
I've heard of things like that.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
time that I know of

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:90%
is going to be humanoid Greys.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When
they get shot down,

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:84%
do they perceive
us to be hostile?

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I think that's
where the trickery comes in,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But I know that it kind
of gets tricky with this

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:90%
because it gets very--

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:84%
it can go very in
the weeds with this

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:84%
because then it just
talking about theories.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So I can't really elaborate
on that, but I know for a fact

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that they do know that.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you aware of any
of these beings working with us

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:90%
in any capacity?

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Officially, no.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I know these Black sites more
particularly are violently

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:90%
taking them down.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So I know that they're not
going to be reluctant to try

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.900 align:middle line:90%
to help with that.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:84%
There have been instances that
I've heard of, and I cannot

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:84%
confirm this, where there has
been people who have intercepted

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:84%
communications from ET saying
that they need their occupants

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
and they need their craft back.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And that was recently.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And if that is the
case, then it kind of

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
shows that we're not working
with them in that nature.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It means that we're
forcefully taking them.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, could it be a fact where
there's been races in the past,

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:84%
such as Eisenhower's meeting,
for example, which is now

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.202 align:middle line:90%
becoming something well-known?

00:29:09.202 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's something I
can't confirm firsthand

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't
there at this meeting,

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:84%
but I've heard other individuals
who have attended that meeting

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:90%
that, yes, it was a real thing.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, it's
happened in areas

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
where some of these
installations happen to be at.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Alamogordo.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.833 align:middle line:90%
White sands.

00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: There's a lot of
facilities there underground.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.708 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the agenda
of these crash retrievals with

00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:33.002 align:middle line:90%
the people that you work with?

00:29:33.002 --> 00:29:35.085 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: The agenda is
basically just to cordon

00:29:35.085 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:84%
the area off and get these
done very, very quick.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the agenda, at least,
to get their job contained.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:84%
That way, there is no tampering
of other outside agencies

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it acquiring
technology, basically?

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes, that's--

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.890 align:middle line:84%
now, it's research and
development is the main thing.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Biology.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.315 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yes,
research, development,

00:29:53.315 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:84%
biology are the main
things with this.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, there some handlers
in this organization that

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.720 align:middle line:84%
may be personally that's what
they want, is this technology,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and they may benefit from
using that personally.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
But I know research,
development, and biology

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
are the main aspects that
this is sought after.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And who do
they sell that to?

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Interagency,
different other--

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
it may be other companies
that they work with

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.803 align:middle line:84%
or other organizations
that they sell this to.

00:30:17.803 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they ever
keep it for themselves,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.127 align:middle line:90%
for their own secret agenda?

00:30:22.127 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Yes,
they do all the time.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.127 align:middle line:84%
And as far as their
secret agenda,

00:30:25.127 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea
specifically what that is.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.133 align:middle line:84%
That has not been
embellished to me yet.

00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mike, where do you
see this all going as we look

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:90%
into the future?

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.392 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, with
the research, development,

00:30:35.392 --> 00:30:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and biology of this, if this is
to get into a conventional means

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:84%
such as government, it's going
to provide our race as humans

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:84%
a better understanding of
who our companions are out

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
in the star systems, with
those technologies associated.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think more if
we're understanding

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
what granted that,
what people are looking

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:84%
for first is disclosure
to be something

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.945 align:middle line:84%
where the president comes out
and says, yes, they're real.

00:30:57.945 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
going to happen.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And sorry, I hate to
burst anybody's bubble,

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:84%
but disclosure has
already happened.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:84%
It's been proof all of this ever
since ancient civilizations.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So people have to wrap
their head in that.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:90%
That's already happened.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen in a way

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
that everybody thinks it does.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a slow drip.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as the
disclosure of us

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
as humans already
having this technology,

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
problem comes in.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the main focus
that a lot of people

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:84%
understand in the
government, as well

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:84%
as these top secret programs
or these deep Black programs

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to have
to explain a lot as

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:84%
far as the technology that
it's already been derived

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial
technology, such as the scalar

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:90%
ones we've talked about.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:84%
That's all derived from
extraterrestrial technology

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:90%
for that matter.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:84%
There may be some instances
where AI could potentially

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:90%
be derived from that, too.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
I personally don't know.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot of the stuff
coming from that may also

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:90%
be because of this technology.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do you think the
people will respond also about

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:84%
our history that will be
changed a little bit there?

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I can tell
that us as a human race,

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.290 align:middle line:84%
we only know from our
environment and what

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.070 align:middle line:84%
we're exposed to, and
that's how we learn.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We also expect people
to tell us the truth.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:84%
But these people
that try to tell us

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.107 align:middle line:84%
the truth, if they're
bought and paid for,

00:32:12.107 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to give
us the meat and potatoes

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.100 align:middle line:90%
that we need to know.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:84%
They're going to give us
some sort of falsehood

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:84%
of trying to expand on, and
that's how people came about.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you're telling me
the last couple thousand years,

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
humans have been
programmed by humans?

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Very much so.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: But it's
unfortunate, though,

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:84%
because that's
exactly what it is.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It is.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.682 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: How do you think
in reference to the secret

00:32:36.682 --> 00:32:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of materialization of certain
things or even knowledge as far

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.120 align:middle line:84%
as meditation or even bettering
ourselves consciously?

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:84%
That's been locked
away and slowly

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.640 align:middle line:84%
coming out to people who are not
afraid to relinquish that over.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But what has made it simplified
is using this ET technology

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to do that for us instead of us
having to do it for ourselves.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It would be great
to have that technology today

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:90%
and looking forward to it.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It's seeping out every
day, as you said.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes, it is.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, Michael, thank
you for being on the show.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.630 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Hey, thanks
for having me on.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
