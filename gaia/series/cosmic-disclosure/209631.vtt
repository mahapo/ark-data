>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're joined by Anjali,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:10%
a former Pentagon
intelligence officer,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:10%
trained in information
operations and warfare.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:10%
Richard Doty also joins us,
a retired counterintelligence

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:10%
agent who served in
the Air Force Office

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we have Tim,
a tactical advisor

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on this planet.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Anjali, please explain to the
audience your first experience

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> My first memory
of experiences with

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials was in 1976
in Jacksonville, Florida.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I was four years old.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:90%
I was asleep in my bed.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
I was in a craft.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:90%
I was completely awake.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And there were small children,
other children of various ages.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They looked pretty human, but
their skin wasn't quite right.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
They had more of a flat ash
kind of tint to their skin.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had absolutely no
body hair that was visible.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And their eyes were
a little larger,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and their mouths were
a little smaller.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So there were just
slight differences

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
where they wouldn't quite
be able to pass for human.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's what the--

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to classify
them as adult beings that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:84%
were in the same
room that I was in--

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:84%
they told me that these were
my brothers and sisters,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that they had been attempting
to make a biotechnology that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
was compatible with putting
this consciousness in a body

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and having it pass for human and
integrate into human society.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The children that
were there were all

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
extremely happy to see me.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were, like, pinching
my skin, feeling my skin,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and pulling at my clothes,
and kind of tickling me--

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:90%
not really meaning to--

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and touching my hair.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
beautiful experience.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very surreal.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Were they the same
age, you think?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Or?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> No, they were various
ages, various heights.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were taller than--

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.105 align:middle line:84%
maybe they were more like
middle elementary school age,

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, just a little taller
than the other children.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And at home, what
was happening was

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
there was a large craft
that was over my house,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and everybody in the
neighborhood was outside.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Most of them had
congregated in our driveway.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:84%
My mother and the
other people who

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
were living in the home
were all outside, looking up

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.070 align:middle line:84%
into this craft for
goodness knows how long.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:90%
We're not really sure.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Not really sure how it ended,
how the experience ended,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember once I
was put back into the house,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I was just back in my room.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So I ran down the
hallway, and I jumped

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the couch,
and I looked outside.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
over the bushes right

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:90%
outside the window.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was everybody
in the neighborhood,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.188 align:middle line:84%
standing in my driveway,
including my mom.

00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're all looking
up, and they're all

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:90%
bathed in these lights that--

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't see it at that point.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was, like,
turning, and so it

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:84%
was changing the lights
that were coming down.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And that incident made
it to the records, right?

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It did.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me-- let
me rephrase that.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
What made it to the record was
that someone reported to NUFORC

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that they had seen, in
1976, a craft matching

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
the exact same description
in an area of town

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that I lived in in the time
of year that this happened,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:90%
which was summer.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first time
you told me that story,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I instantly thought, oh my god,
she went to the grade school

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:90%
for gifted kids.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So when the Greys came
to that conclusion

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that the first attempts to
make contact with governments

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and people on this planet
was not as successful as they

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
thought it should
be, they started

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
their own hybrid
program in order

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to make a comfortable contact
with people on this planet.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And what they also did is
installing a kind of school

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
where all these hybrid
babies actually get educated.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They also get chipped,
which sounds awful,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
an implant that

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:84%
helps monitoring the
health status and blood

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
rates, nutritional level,
and also where they

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:90%
are on the planet.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:84%
They get educated on different
scientific, spiritual,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:90%
and social topics as well.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that
these hybrid babies get--

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
this is not a
one-time-only experience,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
but it happens many times
and goes over probably,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:84%
in most cases, over
some years even in order

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
to educate those children.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I do have
another time that I have--

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:90%
missing time as a child.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
11 years old,
sitting at the table

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
very early in the morning,
about to have breakfast.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And I looked out my window.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:90%
It's still dark outside.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And there is an
owl that's sitting

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
on the branch of the
tree that was growing

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:90%
right outside of our house.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
about this owl that

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
was so captivating, I
couldn't stop staring at it.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, that
owl's face slowly

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
changed into what we would now
consider a traditional Grey.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And then after that, the next
thing I knew it was a couple

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
of hours later, and I'm
sitting at the table.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:90%
It's daylight.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
My cereal's uneaten,
and I've missed the bus.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>> But it also indicates that
you might be closer-related

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to the Greys than
most other people.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know very
much about the Greys as humans

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:90%
understand them.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that the
beings that I have contact

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
with, that I still have
conscious communication with,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
they are loving and
compassionate beings.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And if there is
an idea out there

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:84%
that Greys are negative
or harmful, then calling

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the beings that I'm
with Greys is a misnomer

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:90%
because they aren't harmful.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.927 align:middle line:84%
And they're not--
there's no malice.

00:07:27.927 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You were first visited
when you were three years old.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they warn you not to
discuss this visitation with

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:90%
your parents?

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Your mother or your father,
did they caution you not

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:90%
to disclose their identity?

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Did they tell you not to?

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Or did they--

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I do not recall that.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall ever
feeling like that.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I recall having a lot of
discussions with my mother

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
the little people.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
She was very receptive to
that and understanding,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
light of the fact

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that she was standing
under a craft

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
for God knows how
long with everyone

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:90%
else in the neighborhood.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Anjali, what you experienced
during your time with these

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
visitors, did they discuss
or did they show you how

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:84%
to interact with hybrid
children or hybrids?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Did you experience it?

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Did you see it?

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I-- that's
a good question.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.502 align:middle line:84%
What I experienced was
conscious communication.

00:08:31.502 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So if that is a
learning experience,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
then I would say yes
that I was taught

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
how to communicate
in the respect

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that I was just
doing it naturally.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
most of the school.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I wish that I did.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I would love to be regressed
and go deeper into that.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it would
be really valuable.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that I
already know everything

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:90%
that I need to know.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I have beings around me
that are guiding the things

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:90%
that I need to tell people.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:90%
And there are a lot of things.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
They'll say to me, don't
waste any energy on that.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Put down human affairs.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Walk away from human affairs.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:90%
They say that a lot.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Stop that.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
They'll correct me
constantly because they

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
say that it will
affect my ability

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to communicate so
clearly with them,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that it's an energetic
flow that we are now in,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and I have to maintain it.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know if you ever met
a hybrid person or a child,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that you related to them, or
they told you they were hybrid?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't remember any children
ever telling me that they were

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:84%
hybrid that I had
met as a child.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I would have to really
think about that.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember that.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it
would have even made sense

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to me at that time.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I have met people, before
coming out with my story

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and since coming out
with my experience, who

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
have come forward to me and
told me that they were hybrid.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But these people
were in the public?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
They weren't in-- they
weren't when you were--

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:90%
These people are public people.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:90%
They're just other human beings.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
They look like
they're human beings.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The beings say that not
everybody, not all human beings

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:84%
are a hybrid with a
consciousness that they

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.530 align:middle line:90%
have planted for the awakening.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
There are specific people
who have come down here to be

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:90%
catalysts for the awakening.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
The entities or the beings who
are saying, it's time to leave,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
it's time to leave-- because
I'm sure you probably

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
heard a lot of that--
is they're trying

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to look for their people
who haven't awoken

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:84%
that need to awaken so that
they can find them and take them

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
off the planet because
they are here to do a job.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want them
on the surface of the Earth

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:90%
when the cataclysm comes.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So you think
they collect them?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I do think they
will collect them.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Hmm, because my impression
is that there are some

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
restrictions Earth-wise
that might stand in the way,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
speaking about governments
concealing the airspace as much

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
as possible in order to prevent
foreign entities in here.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be at a time period

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that we will not have to be
concerned about that anymore.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
that there's going

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:90%
to be a worldwide blackout.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.330 align:middle line:84%
They just show me
complete darkness.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, there's not

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
a weapon or a
defense system that

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
exists for humanity in this
world that can stop them

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:90%
from collecting their people.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
humanity, in some way,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
continues to have the
societies that they

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
have at the behest
of these beings who

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
could interfere at any time if
we are destroying the garden.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the hybrids
are down here to monitor us,

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or they created the
hybrids to monitor us,

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
or to prevent something
from happening?

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding is that
they're here to essentially

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
manifest the awakening by
bringing in their vibration,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:84%
the energetic density that
they bring to the physical body

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
at the time when the Earth
itself is going through

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:90%
essentially an upgrade.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's moving from one
density to another.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's having its own
separate consciousness upgrade

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
that is related to the
complete overturn of most

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of the surface of the Earth.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there are
people here watching us

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
in hybrid form, but I do know
that there are hybrids here

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
who are here for the
purpose of waking people up.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the same respect,
I wouldn't be surprised

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
if there were people on the
surface of the Earth who

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:84%
are operating in this
world, who were hybrids,

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:90%
sit here to watch.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I only say that
because they have

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:84%
said that there are essentially
multiple societies that

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
are arriving in an
area around Earth that

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
are coming to watch essentially
how the council handles

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the end of this
cycle and separating

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
the wheat from the chaff.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a test.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
a test for them.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel that this council
is just one particular race

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:90%
of ETs?

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a wide variety
of different ET races?

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I am 100% positive that it
is made up of a variety of ET

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
races because I was
in a room with several

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
of the representatives
of the council.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I talked with them,
and they explained to me

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
what the job of the council
was and what my job was

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:90%
and how I needed to begin.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm 100% confident
that it's a conglomerate

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
of multiple races
who have interest

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in this experiment
that's happening here.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And they work essentially
for the creator

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:90%
that they knew personally.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.525 align:middle line:84%
>> The United States government
is here to protect the United

00:15:10.525 --> 00:15:11.325 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Not all entities
within the government,

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Defense and
other agencies and military

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:90%
know the subjects of hybrids.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But the inner-working
groups that do know this,

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
they want to know how they
can detect a hybrid from a non

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.580 align:middle line:90%
hybrid.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:84%
In your contacts
with these entities,

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
have you have any knowledge
of how one can detect hybrids

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:90%
from non-hybrids?

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I do not have knowledge
about how to detect a hybrid.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that they
tell you if you are.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
hybrid, and you're

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
having conscious contact
or even physical contact,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you
that you are a hybrid.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you when you are
ready, when you can handle it.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a consciousness-learning
experience.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>> So a hybrid--

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
while this hybrid is-- when it's
born, it raises, it develops.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know it's a hybrid?

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Not unless they tell you.

00:16:30.377 --> 00:16:31.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Not unless they tell you?

00:16:31.543 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Unless they tell you.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The ETs are
going to tell you.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> They make sure.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they will
approach those children a lot

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and a lot over the
course of their lifetime.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And in a senseful way,
that's, for example,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
one reason why they have
these implants in order

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to detect them wherever
they are and they

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:90%
know how to reach out to them.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Another question.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:84%
During your interaction
with the council,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
did you feel at all whether
there was any religious aspects

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
to their goal, or
whether there was a deity

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:90%
that they were reacting to?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just
philosophical discussions

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
regarding what they wanted?

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Was there any religious
aspects to this?

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There was neither a
discussion about a deity nor

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:90%
a philosophy.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider what they
told me to be a philosophy.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I consider it to be a fact.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying--
I can't claim

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:90%
to understand the mechanism.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that's way above
my pay grade today.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:50.677 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that they are
trying to tell us the truth.

00:17:50.677 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are
trying to tell us the truth.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there
are many different layers

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
to that truth because it-- and
I think that it all comes down

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:84%
in the end to getting
back to that source

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and understanding who we
are, awakening to that,

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
taking all of the
knowledge and wisdom

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that we have learned from
our sensory experience

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
into the next density so
that we can coalesce when

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
we get to fifth and
sixth, so that when

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:84%
we go into the eighth
density, we know who we are,

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:90%
and we split again.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And we do it all
over, and we spread.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
We spread across
all of the darkness,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.457 align:middle line:90%
and we light it straight up.

00:18:33.457 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's how consciousness
just grows and learns

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:90%
on and on and on.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's all right now because
as we're going forward,

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:90%
behind us it's fading.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
just right here.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:90%
It's all right here.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't even exist anymore.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.286 align:middle line:84%
And what we look ahead
and we think we're seeing,

00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:90%
that's just projection.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all right here, they say.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be-- we
have to be present.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:90%
We have to listen.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we might have some
idea about who is hybrid

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and who isn't
because we may have

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:90%
the sense of the resonation.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.863 align:middle line:84%
And you can call
that discernment.

00:19:12.863 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
You can call it
anything you want.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:84%
But they did not talk
about deities or gods.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they said
they don't know where

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:90%
source came from initially.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's old, it's so far back now,
they can't even account for it.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
They just know that it
just goes on and on and on,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that we just continue
this endlessly.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Working in the genetic
labs, we have found out that

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.890 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials
have human DNA.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And having the access
to the genetic labs

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
DNA bank,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:84%
we also noted that most
humans have a percentage

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial DNA.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So some might be more of
this, or more of that,

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
or more of a percentage.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It's what we kind
of came out with.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
some people actually

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
have this hybrid DNA
in them, but it's

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:84%
at different levels
for their growth.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you listen
to what EBE told us,

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
the ET that was out
of the Roswell craft,

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:84%
he explained that all entities
within the universe were

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't explain
exactly how because he

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
was so advanced
in this technology

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't explain it,
but what we grasped from what he

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.300 align:middle line:90%
said was we're somehow related.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking
about the frequency

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA from different
extraterrestrial genetics

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:84%
because it emanates a
different frequency.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.083 align:middle line:84%
So I can have a feeling, like
when I met you, oh, yeah, I

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:90%
know what you are, you know?

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's just a feeling
because I can read frequencies.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So I want to know about Tim.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Out of the hundreds
of extraterrestrials

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:84%
you've been involved with and
have met, have any of them

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
ever mentioned the hybrid
colonization of Earth?

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> So yes, of course, that's a--

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:90%
it's a program.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So different species, we
know about, well, at least

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:24.980 align:middle line:84%
dozens of species that have
their own hybridization

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:90%
program on Earth.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Which specific
race is running that?

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Each one is
running their own.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And how many races are there?

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> How many races?

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:90%
So at least a dozen.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I've lately heard
some upgraded numbers

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:90%
that it must be even more.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is not even counting
in those individual, higher

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
frequencial, more experienced
beings that incarnate on us.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that the program
that the Greys have with

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the school is one of the most
profound and sophisticated

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:09.580 align:middle line:84%
there is because they like
to keep things nice and tidy

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:90%
and organized.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Other hybrid programs might
be a little more loose.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I think the
hybrid school of the Greys

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
thought-through progress there

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, I'm glad you brought
that one part up where you said

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't include
just the 3D biologics.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
They're incarnates, there's
walk-ins in the projects.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We have special biofield
viewers where you can see when--

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
it measures it like a
frequency, a Rife machine,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
of that entity coming
into that person.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So that person might harbor a
few extraterrestrial entities,

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:84%
or one, or just temporary
do that to have a meeting.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad it's--

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
thinking that it's

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
about embryos and Petri dishes
and we're hybridization.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
ways this can happen.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be too.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It can be, like,
lab-produced babies as well.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But there's definitely also
like a spiritual component

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
to it, which is a kind of
controversial aspect to it

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that a born fetus
or a growing fetus

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
could have more than
one individual soul

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness that
wants to enter that body.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's then on
a different plane

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to arrange which one
gets the opportunity.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things the United
States government has done,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:84%
going back to the '80s, was an
operation called Project Cross

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Bridge.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you know about Cross
Bridge is when somebody tries

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
to enter in the
military, there's

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
certain vial of blood they
take, and they send that

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:90%
to a special laboratory.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was an extremely
classified program.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The public didn't know
where that other vial went.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:90%
But it was a way--

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
there was something
in the blood.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a biologist,
maybe Emery can talk about it.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
There's something in the
blood that distinguishes

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:84%
a human a full human
complete human from a hybrid

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Department of
Defense developed a way,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
how they did that,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
but Dr. Kit Green
talks about this.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go in,
you get a blood test.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:90%
They take that extra vial.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:90%
They send it away.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And they can determine
if you're a human

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:90%
or whether you're a hybrid.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That is correct.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:84%
There's different
types of proteins,

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
along with the DNA, of
course, that's in there,

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:90%
which is a sure giveaway.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But that can also be masked
and cloaked, as Tim knows.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Cellular material
can be doing that.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But you can't cloak
the proteins that

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:90%
are everywhere in your body.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
proteins that are not--

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say it-- of an Earth
origin that can be traced.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Where do you see the
hybridization programs

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:90%
going here on planet Earth?

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the United
States governments--

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and I know personally
from the Reagan Era--

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
was very concerned about
whether an ET could

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:90%
infiltrate American society.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, back in those days,
there wasn't much talk

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
about hybrid or hybridization
because we didn't

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:90%
know a lot about it then.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But DIA and some other
agencies started projects

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to classified-- highly
classified projects

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:90%
to try to determine that.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:84%
President Reagan was
very, very interested

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
because he was told of the
threat that some of these ETs

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.087 align:middle line:90%
could pose to our planet.

00:25:54.087 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And he went public with that.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And he went public
with that, several times.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And you just have to go to
his library in California

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and read some of
the notes and essays

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that he wrote to
himself about this.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So the United States
government started

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:84%
programs, the
Department of Defense,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the DIA, the CIA, all the
alphabet agencies started

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:84%
programs trying to detect
whether these ETs could

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:90%
come in posed as a human.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's what it was then.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Again, hybridization wasn't--

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.175 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't a big topic.

00:26:27.175 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't a big topic.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It was, could they come in
and mask themselves as--

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and I could talk for hours
about operations that we did.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
We went going out and
trailing people and kind

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:84%
of clandestinely, covertly
tailing them to find out

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:84%
if they were because we
had some reason to believe

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:90%
that they were not human.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So the government was trying to
protect society from these ETs.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You know one of the things
that has really been on my mind

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
is, looking around
this table right now,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:90%
we're all connected to intel.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And we know that some of
the highest-level people

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.040 align:middle line:84%
in governments
across the world who

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
are investigating the phenomena
are actually contactees

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So I've been wondering if
the placement is intentional.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Are they intentionally
placing people

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:84%
who are hybrids within
positions in government

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that deal with highly
classified information?

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And I would say--

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:90%
from everything that I see--

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:90%
I'd say yes.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think it's a
universal motivational thing

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that's a natural pattern that
brings people into certain

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I assume that ETs
have an interest

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
in placing their hybrids
in certain positions.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
there's this kind

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:90%
of free will in the universe.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>> There is.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's very complicated
to motivate or move someone

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to a certain direction if they
are not willing to explore

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.630 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is everyone's
thoughts on the hybridization

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think, number
one, it's very difficult

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
to understand an
extraterrestrial's reasoning

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.860 align:middle line:90%
or what their missions are.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:84%
They're different
biologically than we are.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Their minds are different,
brains are different.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think there is
some sort of a program

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that they developed, whatever
particular race of ETs you're

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:84%
talking about, to
hybridize Earth.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
an active program,

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:84%
probably has been going on
not for 10, or 12, or 15,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.440 align:middle line:84%
or 30, but probably
for a thousand years.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think, Anjali?

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems that this
experience that we have when

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:84%
there's a consciousness
incarnate in our bodies is

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:90%
about growth and learning.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And they corrected
me over something

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that I said earlier, when I
said that the only people who

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:84%
were hybrids, I
thought, were people

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.470 align:middle line:90%
were here to awaken everyone.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted
me to correct myself.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And they've said that humanity
wasn't a naturally-occurring

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:90%
race, that everyone has--

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:90%
it was created.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted me to specify
that, first of all, none of us

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:90%
are--

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
none of these bodies
were naturally occurring.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
We did not spontaneously
occur from this Earth, OK?

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We only need to look around at
all of the animals and trees

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to know that, to see
what came from the Earth.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.130 align:middle line:90%
We did not come from the Earth.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel that we just have
to accept this, acknowledge it,

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and ask ourselves
what we're going

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to do with that
opportunity and the things

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:90%
that they're asking us.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess how
I feel about it

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is each individual person
who is incarnate here

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
has to make the choice
about what it means.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it means for you,

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:84%
but I know that you have your
own separate consciousness

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:84%
experience, even though we
come from the same thing.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
think about all of it.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Very beautifully put.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Tim?

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that it's
a question of definition,

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
how we define hybridization and
hybrids at all because everyone

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and each one on this planet and
every other planet in the whole

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:84%
universe, basically, cannot
be separated from a hybridized

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:90%
influence.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.250 align:middle line:84%
That's just the
way genetics work.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has certain strains
and influences from somewhere.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I understand the
perception of hybridization

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
is like being more
or less connected

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:90%
to one group or another.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
in the philosophy of humans

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that they have this
in-group, out-group thinking.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the end, it's all
consciousness, and it's all us.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think that is the
much more elaborated way

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of how to think about it.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Good one.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well put.

00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to thank everyone
for coming on the show.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It's been such a pleasure.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:22.848 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> As the beings have said, the
closer that we get to the end

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of the cycle, we're going
to be faced with decisions

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and choices that will
determine what happens next.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the Earth coming
to an end in its cycle?

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that happens frequently.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.810 align:middle line:90%
It happened before.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to happen
again, but it's happening now.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> This was never meant to be
a permanent situation for any

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.220 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the beginning
and an end of anything.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.120 align:middle line:90%
This is just an expression.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:90%
