>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy
Cramer, who claims

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.200 align:middle line:10%
to have been part of military
interplanetary missions.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Randy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.375 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does the covert
military space program

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.418 align:middle line:90%
have bases on other planets?

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I certainly
couldn't name all of them

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
because there are
dozens or probably even

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:90%
hundreds at this point.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:90%
But, oh, yeah.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What comes to
mind in our solar system?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: [SIGHS] I would say
that any planetary body that we

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
could put a base on, or
any satellite of a planet

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.852 align:middle line:84%
that would be a strategically
good place to have one

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:90%
is a place where we have one.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Any place that we could
or would need one,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
we have one at this point
in the solar system.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are
these constructed?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Are they on the surface?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Or the inside?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Underground?

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Most of the time,
most of the construction

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
is underground for safety
and defensive purposes.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- depending on the
facility will depend on how

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
much juts out of the rock
or out of the ground.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that the largest
percentage of these facilities

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:90%
are subterranean usually.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you describe
some of your missions,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.847 align:middle line:84%
these covert missions that
you were on, on these planets?

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I know you went
through a lot of them.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
There is actually a conflict
in the Cassiopean system

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
where a friendly species was
encroached upon by an aggressor

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
species who had purchased
some military technology

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
from someone else and,
because we already

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
had a trade
relationship with them,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
they essentially picked
up the phone and called us

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:90%
and asked for help.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.605 align:middle line:84%
And we sent some troops
and were deployed there.

00:01:57.605 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what other kind
of missions did you guys do?

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Like, what was the
agenda, do you think?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Ah, most
of the time when

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I was engaged in
off-world missions,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:90%
it was high value targets.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So it was either
extract someone that you

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.883 align:middle line:84%
want to keep alive or kill
someone that you want dead.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you killed
any extraterrestrials

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.685 align:middle line:90%
in your lifetime?

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:16.893 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: [LAUGHS] Countless.

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I honestly couldn't tell
you the number, it's so many.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
What was it like being
at war, in combat,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
against extraterrestrials?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, interestingly
enough, any time that I've ever

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
had to take the life
of another human being,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
there's some
emotional wrestling,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's remorse,
guilt, or, ah,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I wish I wouldn't
have had to do that.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:90%
But I have to be honest.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.945 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a military
conflict with another species,

00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a
problem with it.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Never had issues with remorse.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:90%
In some cases, it's--

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hate to
say it this way,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it's the
same as killing a monster.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Like, you wouldn't
debate or feel

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:90%
bad about killing a monster.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So something that's
completely not

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
like you in a military theater,
a situation where everyone

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:90%
is trying to kill each other.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty easy, to
be honest with you.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Just a target.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Just a target.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Just a moving, breathing
target at that point, yeah.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You said the word,
"monster," so now I'm thinking,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
what did some of
these look like?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
[SIGHS],, you know,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
occasionally we're

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
dealing with
intelligent species.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you're dealing
with less intelligent species,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
which could be described
as animal, or even, like,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
monster-type lifeforms, if
they're big enough, I mean.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.746 align:middle line:84%
If it's big enough, we'd
just call it a monster.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:34.546 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.387 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So, I
mean, you could be

00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
talking about large
insects, large reptiles,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
large amphibioids, as well as
species who are similar to us

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:90%
or incredibly different.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could mean
different limbs, cephalapods.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a pretty wide range.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you ever
encounter during combat

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial species
that could get in your mind

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
or that was talking
to the troops?

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Or getting in there to maybe
make them turn on each other

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.993 align:middle line:90%
or to mind control you?

00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
certainly, when we

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
engaged with the indigenous
reptoids on Mars,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
they were actually a
very psionic species.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And so their ability to get
inside our heads, sometimes

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.337 align:middle line:84%
make us see things
that weren't there,

00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
that was probably the number
one thing that it would do,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:90%
or they would do.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
A number of times
we would encounter

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
this fog that you couldn't see
through that was like pea soup.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But we'd have the
intelligence officers

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
who were looking at
other cameras tell me,

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.207 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:04:36.207 --> 00:04:37.123 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:04:37.123 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, I can't see six
inches in front of my face.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's here, as
far as I can tell.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But that was all
psionic illusions.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So them just putting
the images in our minds,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
so it seemed as real as it
would be as if it were real.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's describe
psionics to the audience here.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a lot of people
don't know what that is.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Simple, a
definition of psionics

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:90%
is your mind powers.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So any ability to focus mental
energy, to alter matter energy,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:90%
is a psionic ability.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And did he equip
you with psionic devices

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
to protect you from
some of these instances?

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Not when I
was deployed in the MDF

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
when I was on Mars.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We basically were
pretty vulnerable

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
whenever the indigenous
reptoids wanted

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:90%
to use their psionic abilities.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out,
they didn't use them

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:90%
as often as they could have.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.375 align:middle line:84%
They really were pulling punches
with us, to be honest with you.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:35.152 align:middle line:84%
If they would have flexed their
full power of their muscle,

00:05:35.152 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the conflict would have
been over very quickly.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So they were kid gloves
with us, for sure.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are your gifts
that you have with psionics?

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Because I know you teach it.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I do.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:90%
I do teach a psionics class.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So I was genetically
engineered to have a higher

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:90%
propensity for psionic ability.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Was given a rudimentary
training in the military.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, [SIGHS] long story,
and a minor spoiler alert

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:90%
for my book that's coming out.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.857 align:middle line:84%
When we were captured by the
indigenous reptoids on Mars,

00:06:03.857 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
they did was actually

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
put us through their
psionic training program.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I would say that that was
a point in where my combat

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
abilities were rather enhanced
by the psionic abilities

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that we were able-- that we
were taught and able to perform.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were you foretelling
what the next punch would be?

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Were-- what kind of--

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:90%
explain--

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Certainly,
a precognitive ability

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to sense an attack
seconds or an instant

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
before it come, yeah,
that's pretty natural.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Definitely
lifesaving in our jobs.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you know how to--

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
if you can sense where
a projectile is coming

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and simply not be on the line
where the projectile is, then,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you just dodged
a bullet, literally.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So there are some other things
that we could do in combat.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- [SIGHS] it sounds like
I'm bragging if I go into a lot

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:90%
of detail about that.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But they were combat proficient
and could enhance and/or take

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:90%
life, for sure.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.277 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is an
indigenous reptoid?

00:07:07.277 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, if we're talking
about the indigenous reptoids

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, they are
an evolved reptilian

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:84%
species that is derived from
essentially like a rock lizard.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to have
skin tone, scale tones,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:90%
that are in sandy colors.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But they also have some
pretty bright patterns

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that can appear in their
backs, on their arms.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So you can see
patterns that can be

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:84%
in yellow, black, red, some
very bright contrasting colors.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So they're evolved from,
basically, a rock lizard.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Short snout, medium
to tall heights.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
They can be anywhere I'd say
from about 5' 5" to almost 7'

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:90%
tall.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
They do have a tail that
is usable in combat.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I've been swiped more
than once by a tail.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And they hurt.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's a
big, strong muscle.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a big muscle.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.887 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's a big muscle.

00:07:57.887 --> 00:07:58.888 align:middle line:90%
Can sweep out your legs.

00:07:58.888 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Been knocked unconscious.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.763 align:middle line:84%
Got clubbed in the head
with one , one time.

00:08:01.763 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, they're fierce.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
They have claws when
they want to use them.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Again, they're very intelligent.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:90%
They prefer hand-to-hand combat.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that they use

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
with their own
psionic abilities is

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
essentially to make our
projectiles curve around them.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes at a distance, not
much effectiveness would occur.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And we would have to get--
close to the distance

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and engage in really what is
almost a primitive 18-- you

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
know, 1400s to 1800s
style ground combat

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:84%
where you're either getting
close with a bayonet,

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
or rushing across a field,
and just brutalizing

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:90%
each other up close.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you see them
have any weapons or equipment

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.855 align:middle line:90%
of sorts?

00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Not in the field.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
When they were on
the field, they

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
tended to keep it
very, very simple.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
When we spent time with
them, they definitely

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
had a technological ability
to make tools, items,

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:90%
that were very sophisticated.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.468 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
use much technology

00:09:07.468 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:90%
in their day-to-day life.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
They really chose to live
in a very simple, hands on,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:90%
low technology reality.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But their ability and I'm
pretty sure the technology

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that they had out of
sight was very advanced.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Before the destruction
of the surface

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
of the planet many, many
thousands of years ago,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
they were obviously
very, very advanced.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And after the destruction
of the surface,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
most of those who
were left underground

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:84%
took on a very
different attitude

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
about what technology was for.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.125 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them purposefully
reduced the impact and use

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
of technology in their
day-to-day life because they

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
saw in the past that it only led
to greater and greater military

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:84%
conflict, and eventually the
destruction of the surface,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:90%
and billions of their--

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
members of their species.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So are they
a-- they're obviously

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
a master of telekinesis because
they can move projectiles.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That means they
can probably move you.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I observed a-- what I
would say a small division

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
of indigenous reptoids bring
down a Draconian drop ship

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.232 align:middle line:84%
at speed into the
ground so that it

00:10:18.232 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:84%
when it slammed
into the ground, it

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:90%
broke into millions of pieces.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And they did that with a
psionic telekinetic grab

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and pulled it right down
to the ground as a group.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.177 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:29.235 align:middle line:90%
Was it a group effort?

00:10:29.235 --> 00:10:30.035 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:10:30.035 --> 00:10:32.510 align:middle line:84%
They-- all their hands
went up at the same time,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:90%
went down at the same time.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And, as they made
this motion, the ship

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
just slammed into the ground.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And I need to
emphasize, at speed.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just bring
it down to the ground.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They threw it into the ground
at speed so that when it hit,

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.853 align:middle line:84%
it just broke apart
into millions of pieces.

00:10:47.853 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there
are people in there?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The drop ship had
already sent out

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
a small battalion of
Draconians that were decimated

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:90%
by this reptoid battalion.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.443 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the
ship tried to leave,

00:11:03.443 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
they just grabbed
onto it and slammed it

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
right back into the ground.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is a Draconian?

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, Draconian is
another reptoid species.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to look more like
a crocodile or an alligator.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They've got a long
snout, dark green skin.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of the higher echelons
can have wings, can be winged.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Some of them can be very tall.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
As a species, they tend to
be the a-holes of the galaxy,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:90%
and very aggressive.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Their main tactic
and strategy is fear.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they love to make
people feel like they're

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:90%
super strong, super terrifying.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're so powerful, we
can't possibly beat them.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
But they bleed like
everything else.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And so once we
started to understand

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:84%
that their main tactic was
to make us feel intimidated,

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:90%
we became less intimidated.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So they're not so
much of an issue.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're military--

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:90%
militarily challenging.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But we have certainly met them
in the field of battle and won.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: These
indigenous reptoids,

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:90%
what was the language like?

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I think the
most important distinction

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
is they have a different
tongue and a different palate.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So the sounds that
we make, we may not

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
think about it are very unique
to our tongue and our palate.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
They're sounds that
are biologically

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
distinctive to what the
physiology of our mouth

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and our tongue and
our lips can do.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So, in the same way,
the sounds that they

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
make for their
language really are

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:84%
dependent on that
biological relationship

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
again between mouth, teeth,
tongue, palate, and so forth.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say a lot of
their language involved

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
sort of guttural sounds,
some kind of hissing sounds,

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:90%
as well as clicks.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.003 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to note
that if I were to say anything

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
in their language, even
though you wouldn't hear it,

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I would be saying it with
a Terran accent, [LAUGHS],,

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
because I can't actually
make the exact sounds

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have the same
tongue and the same palate.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
But their name for the
planet is not Mars.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%
We call it Mars.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.782 align:middle line:90%
They call it Goluka.

00:13:15.782 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Very deep.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And, again, to be honest,
I'm saying that very badly.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.638 align:middle line:84%
So if an indigenous
reptoid were here,

00:13:24.638 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
saying that-- if he
heard me say that, he'd

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
look at me sideways
and go, eh, you know?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Because
they hate it when

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:90%
we mispronounce their words.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you talk and
communicate a lot with them

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:90%
using vocal--

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.142 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They mostly spoke in
English, to be honest with you,

00:13:37.142 --> 00:13:39.600 align:middle line:84%
again, with an accent because
of the tongue and the palate.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.392 align:middle line:84%
And their English was
actually pretty good.

00:13:41.392 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And I learned a few words.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But we were not encouraged
to speak their language

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
because they're very
picky about pronunciation.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
pronounce the word right,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:90%
they'd rather you didn't say it.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It's very-- it's
offensive to their ears.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And they get very-- they get
very rubbed the wrong way when

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:90%
you say words wrong.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.725 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Does sound effect them?

00:14:01.725 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm not sure
what you mean by that?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they sensitive
to frequency and sound?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They have a
really good hearing.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.482 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would say they have
kind of like dog hearing.

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
They can hear in upper
registers and lower registers

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:90%
that we don't hear, for sure.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So if our audible
hearing spectrum is this,

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.047 align:middle line:84%
their audible hearing
spectrum is probably that.

00:14:22.047 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do they eat?

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The indigenous
reptoids actually

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:90%
eat a lot of salamander tail.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
There's these giant salamanders,
and they cut the tails off,

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and then prepare the tails in
a number of different dishes

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that include fungi,
lichens, grasses.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.203 align:middle line:84%
I've described their food
as tasting mostly like mud.

00:14:43.203 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But it's an
acquired taste, as well.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's very nourishing food.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's not exactly what we, as
mammals, would consider tasty.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Do they eat humans?

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.242 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The indigenous
reptoids on Mars do not.

00:14:59.242 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:90%
They do not eat human beings.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I have heard stories
that Draconians will eat

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:90%
anything or anyone, just about.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Whatever food is available.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.148 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you been
on a Draconian ship?

00:15:09.148 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I've been inside one.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that
I've been on one.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:84%
There was one that had
been on the ground.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
The forces that had come
out of it were decimated.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:90%
The ship was disabled.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we stormed the ship
and killed everything, and then

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you tell the
audience, when you walked

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:90%
in there, what did you smell?

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Rotting flesh.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.448 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:31.448 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Let's talk about that.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I mean, it was--

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was not a pretty
smell at all, for sure.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed on a lot
of these crash sites

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:90%
that they have rotting--

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, many different
kinds of species and meat--

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --you know,
rotting in these big bays.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:49.723 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you see
anything like that?

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And, apparently, as I've
been told, that-- that's

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:90%
how they like their food.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
They like their food warm,
rotten, warm, and ugh.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's their-- the way
they like to eat food, so--

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Another thing is,
when you went into this,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
did you have a suit
on at one of the--

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.092 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course
you have your suit.

00:16:09.092 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But did you have
a full helmet on?

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
one of the questions

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.883 align:middle line:84%
people are going to ask,
well, how did you smell?

00:16:17.883 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways to
do it within the suits--

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --with
hearing and smelling.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.375 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can
explain it to them.

00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, the
suits themselves

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:90%
are not a space suit.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:90%
It's an environment suit.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's not exactly
completely, totally,

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:90%
and absolutely airtight.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So there are residual
smells and things

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.970 align:middle line:90%
that can get into the suit.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So a pungent odor, if you're
within the space of a pungent

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
odor for more than
a few minutes,

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
you're likely to be able
to start smelling it.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Some people speak
of mining expeditions

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to these places, and also
going there and controlling

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:90%
ET civilizations.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of this?

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
certainly, we're involved

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:90%
in the mining business.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So we certainly--
there's already

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
companies that are
doing asteroid mining.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere-- I know that
there's mining on Mars.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.902 align:middle line:84%
I can't say everywhere
there is a mining operation.

00:17:11.902 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest
wherever there

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
is a mining operation
that's profitable,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
the mining companies
are going there.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were military forces
deployed on these areas

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:90%
to protect miners at any time?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And why is that?

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.607 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, depending
on where you are,

00:17:24.607 --> 00:17:26.690 align:middle line:84%
you just might be somewhere
where there is, again,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
hostile animals or
a hostile species,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:84%
someone that doesn't
necessarily want you there.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
There's also just random
things they can show up.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
someone there to be prepared,

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
it can cost miners their lives
because miners aren't fighters.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you are
deployed to a planet,

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:84%
what's-- is there
a confrontation?

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Do they accept you?

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.043 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think I'll
make a historical reference

00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:90%
comparison there.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So when European sailing ships
started to explore the world,

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and they started to come across
different indigenous persons

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, sometimes
they were welcomed.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they were turned
into food and cooked in a pot.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how
the aggressiveness

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
or the size of the force might
depend on whether they were--

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
would be engaging with
them militarily, or would

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
get in a conflict,
or whether they'd

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
want to invite them
in and feed them.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
It really is the same
kind of variation.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It really depends
on where you go,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
what the species is, what level
of technology and civilization

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
they have, how pervasive that
is over the entire planet,

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and their own attitudes
about visitors.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Some species are a little more
open to visitors than others.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.683 align:middle line:84%
And some are incredibly
hostile to anything

00:18:44.683 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:90%
that's not from there.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's as wide a
variance of responses

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.743 align:middle line:84%
as you could possibly
think that there are.

00:18:50.743 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what
happened when you

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.878 align:middle line:90%
landed on Mars the first time?

00:18:53.878 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That war was
already in progress.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I got there and
then, oh, we are having a war.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It was already going full speed.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So when I got there, we
were briefed, trained,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.697 align:middle line:84%
and almost immediately
into combat operations.

00:19:06.697 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know how
long the war was going on

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and what other races
besides humans were there?

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, the
location where we were at,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we were close territorially
to an indigenous

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
reptoids and
indigenous insectoids.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I have, however,
been told by people

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
who have been farther
south that there

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:84%
is an indigenous humanoid
species, as well as one

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.733 align:middle line:84%
or two other smaller
sort of pygmy species

00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that aren't from
there originally,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:84%
but have moved there some
thousands of years ago.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's their home as much
as it is anybody else's now.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So there is at least
four or five indigenous--

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
what we call indigenous
species on Mars.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But my encounter was only
with the indigenous reptoids

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.647 align:middle line:90%
and the indigenous insectoids.

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you have to
wear space suits on Mars?

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Or could you breathe
the atmosphere?

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, the air
was thin and breathable,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
but not breathable enough
that you could, like,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:90%
do cardio and fight.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So we had to wear
an environment suit.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So the environment suit
mitigated the temperature

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and oxygen levels.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.912 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't the same as
an air tight space suit So--

00:20:14.912 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
planet like, Randy?

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Could you describe
the environment?

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS] I mean, there was a--

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I would say we used
to say there was

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.480 align:middle line:90%
sort of a summer and a winter.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So winter, it would
get colder and it would snow.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Summer, you'd see
some ice melt and some

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:84%
tributaries and streams and
so forth would start to flow.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.335 align:middle line:84%
And it would get
a little warmer.

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
We were in a fairly
far northerly location

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
that I often describe as
about the same as Alaska.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- in the
winter, it was cold.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And even in the summer,
it was not super hot.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- like
I said, it was--

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you could pop your helmet
open and breathe the air,

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
so long as you didn't have
to run somewhere or fight

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.682 align:middle line:84%
Because that would be like
trying to run or fight

00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:90%
at 18,000 feet or whatever.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But like I said
it was breathable.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
What I found interesting
about the smell

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
is all that iron oxide,
which is just everywhere,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
gives you this
pervasive smell of rust.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I would often take
this whiff of the air

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.582 align:middle line:84%
and be reminded of like
being inside an old abandoned

00:21:18.582 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
factory or something
where you have

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
all this rusty
sort of metal smell

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of stuck into the
ground, and into the walls,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
But there was-- again, where we
were, farther north, the plant

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:90%
life was fairly small.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So small shrubs, small trees,
some grasses, little lizards,

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:90%
little ground burrowing birds.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, I would
say that the animal and plant

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
life, incredibly similar to
what we have here on Earth

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
as what we experienced
there on Mars.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things that weren't
like outlandishly different,

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
like, I have maybe seen on
one or two other places.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually
really similar.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.065 align:middle line:84%
Just like a high
desert environment,

00:22:04.065 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to anyone who's ever
been to Colorado or Utah

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:90%
might know what that's like.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
weather like on Mars?

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Mostly dry.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.095 align:middle line:90%
Mostly clear.

00:22:15.095 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it
would occasionally

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:90%
rain and occasionally snow.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.752 align:middle line:84%
You would occasionally get a
pretty strong windstorm, too.

00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:90%
And there are some tornadoes.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So-- but we didn't get
too much of that weather.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
It was mostly, I would say, dry,
cold, and occasionally slightly

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:90%
wet or snowy.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
color of the ground?

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Like, we always see on
National Geographic it's red.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's actually a broad
range from a deep crimson,

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to a brownish yellow,
to a bright yellow,

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:90%
to a whitish gray.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So-- but when you're
looking at it from the sky,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
again, that sort of
pervasive iron oxide

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:90%
gives it that red tint.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you really look, you
can see that you're really

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:84%
looking at a number of shades
of sort of red, yellow, orange,

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and even some
brighter colors that,

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:90%
again, are sort of whitish.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And when you looked up
at the sun and the atmosphere,

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:90%
what--

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Blue sky.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely a blue sky.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly enough, even though
you're a good distance away,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
the sun looks a little smaller
than it does from here.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:84%
But the light is
surprisingly bright.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I presumed that it would be
dimmer because you're that

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:90%
much farther away.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:84%
It's actually still-- I
mean, a bright day on Mars

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:84%
is still like a
pretty bright day.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.457 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How long
were the days on Mars?

00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:39.415 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's almost
the same as an Earth day.

00:23:39.415 --> 00:23:40.290 align:middle line:90%
It's about 24 hours.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it's 23 and some odd
minutes or something like that.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 23 something.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, but
it's pretty close.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: So, yeah.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.042 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And where did you sleep
and stay during these missions?

00:23:49.042 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: So we had a--

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:90%
the base was inside a mountain.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.855 align:middle line:84%
And our barracks were
in a section of the base

00:23:55.855 --> 00:23:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
Horseshoe because it's

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:90%
shaped like a horseshoe.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And the squads were--

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
squad barracks were on the
outside of the Horseshoe.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, each squad
had its own barracks,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:84%
which was bunks, lockers,
shower, lavatory.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we have
manufacturing facilities

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:90%
there now?

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.645 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:24:17.645 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to people who have
worked in those manufacturing

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:84%
facilities, as well as a
guy who is a pig farmer.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you ever
have any ET cooperation

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
on these missions?

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not so much
when I was in the MDF.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
But there were times when
we were deployed elsewhere

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah,
occasionally, you'd get

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.660 align:middle line:90%
a friendly extraterrestrial.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we were being sent to
help other extraterrestrials,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:90%
in which case we would be--

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:84%
we would really be the
species helping them,

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.438 align:middle line:84%
to be honest with you,
more than anything else.

00:24:48.438 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But you could certainly
say, in that situation,

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that they were
helping us, as well.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the same
way that soldiers

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
who go to Iraq or Afghanistan
need the help of the locals

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to know the lay of the land, and
what's going on, and who's who.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.600 align:middle line:84%
In that same way, they helped
us understand where we were

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and what the situation was.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.598 align:middle line:84%
But we were the heavy
firepower, for sure.

00:25:10.598 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, of course you've
been on many missions to Mars.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Does any of them stand
out that you'd like

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:90%
to share with the audience?

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes and no.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:90%
I hear you.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Some that I might not
like to share, but certainly

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.443 align:middle line:90%
some that I remember.

00:25:25.443 --> 00:25:27.276 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it because
it was too horrific?

00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean, some of them
are just not fun to remember.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Not fun.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Let me
put it this way.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.272 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, the more I
want to remember or talk

00:25:33.272 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:84%
about it is the
more days I'm going

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to have nightmares and sleepless
nights for the next few days.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.853 align:middle line:84%
So that tends to put me in a
position of not necessarily

00:25:40.853 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:84%
wanting to talk
too much about it.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But [SIGHS] most of what
we did was engage out

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.695 align:middle line:84%
on the open plateaus
of Mars in really

00:25:53.695 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:84%
what is, again,
this sort of very

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
classical 15th century to 19th
century kind of style combat.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You'd be-- you'd think that we'd
be using a lot of air power,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
that we'd be using a lot
of directed energy weapons.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
But it just turns
out that we weren't.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons turns out is

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.590 align:middle line:84%
because, again, the
indigenous reptoids

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and their psionic abilities
prevented some of these things

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:90%
from operating.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned
also since then

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
is because that
wasn't the equipment

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.710 align:middle line:90%
that we were trying to test.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Most of the reason that we were
there was to test equipment.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
test the body armor.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
test the rail guns.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to test the
stuff that was about sort

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:84%
of nitty gritty bone crushing
combat that was face-to-face

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, which
is mostly what we did.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of that I
would say were just

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:90%
skirmishes and firefights.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But, occasionally,
we would get sent

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to raid a cave, a
base, a hive, depending

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:90%
on who you're talking about.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.240 align:middle line:90%
That could get pretty sticky.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So-- because you're in dark,
confined spaces sometimes.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes you surprise them.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you get surprised.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.720 align:middle line:84%
That was probably some of
the most, to be honest,

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:84%
nerve racking sort
of experiences.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I would rather
fight something out

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:84%
on a plateau where I can see
in 360 degrees around me,

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of being in a
cave somewhere where

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily know what's
ahead, or around a corner,

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:90%
or in a chamber up ahead.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:84%
But the main purpose
of going on a raid

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
was just to do it
basically like a quick hit.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get
in, try and find

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
their food supply, or
their water source,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:84%
or where their
eggs are, and hit,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.260 align:middle line:90%
smash, crush, and then leave.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You said eggs.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were
inside the eggs?

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: More reptiles.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:90%
More reptoids.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how long do
they take to incubate?

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER:
Fascinatingly enough, I

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
would have expected it to be
a pretty good amount of time.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But it actually only took
about two to four weeks

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:90%
to hatch an egg.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:84%
An egg would actually grow
to about four feet tall.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And when that egg hatches
open, a pretty much full-sized,

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:90%
fully grown reptoid emerges.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does that reptoid
need to be trained?

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Does it need to be
downloaded with anything?

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Or is it ready to go?

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again,
fascinatingly enough,

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:84%
which was a surprise to me
when I learned this, they--

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:84%
again, their psionic
abilities are very developed.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So when some-- when a reptoid
dies, "dies" or its body

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
is terminated on
the battlefield,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
they can direct
their consciousness

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
back to a hatchling cave,
and find an empty egg,

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and house themselves
in that egg,

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and then grow up,
and then reemerge,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
full memory of everything that
they knew before they died.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.955 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So they're fearless.

00:28:53.955 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely fearless.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They have
nothing to worry about.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:90%
They are--

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: As far as
death is concerned.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.730 align:middle line:84%
They are a fierce,
fearless species, for sure.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I have the most respect for
them as an opponent that if--

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:90%
I could have for any opponent.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What was our agenda?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, you being
there, our side,

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
against these reptoids,
what did we want?

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, my
understanding is the excuse

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
or the rationale
was territorialism,

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
to essentially-- this
was our territory.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.270 align:middle line:90%
That's your territory.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:90%
That's your territory.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're arguing over borders,
which my understanding now is

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't really the reason.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was mostly to
test military equipment.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.428 align:middle line:84%
At least, again, when we're
talking about time in the MDF.

00:29:38.428 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
another off-world mission

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else,
again, it depends.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
species is either

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
the friendly species
in that situation,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and which species is
the hostile species.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
How developed is the world
that you're going to?

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it a home world or
is it a colony world?

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a mining station?

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a rock that
is a territorial conquest

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.020 align:middle line:90%
of another species?

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Who lives there?

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.930 align:middle line:84%
What biological
life lives there?

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Are they tribal?

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they-- do they
live in cities?

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:90%
How advanced are they?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Those are all what I would
just call tactical variables.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on
the tactical variables

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
depends on how the tactical
officers plan the mission.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we're just
essentially getting

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:84%
the basics of what we need
to know to deploy, what

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:27.480 align:middle line:90%
our mission parameters are.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And, again, most of it
is high value targets.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So it was either entering
into a hot situation

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:84%
to grab someone that
we wanted to get out,

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.880 align:middle line:84%
or entering into
a situation where

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.700 align:middle line:84%
we needed to eliminate
someone very specific.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the 20 & Back
program, if you die there,

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:90%
what happens to you?

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Ooh.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I were to die under
those circumstances, I mean--

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:90%
let me answer that another way.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I've certainly
experienced enough damage

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to my body in which I would
say temporary death occurred.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.672 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, I left my
body and entered

00:31:06.672 --> 00:31:08.630 align:middle line:84%
into a state of consciousness
that people would

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:90%
call a near-death experience.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:84%
But because of their ability
to put the body back together,

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and hold onto that silver cord--

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
as long as your silver
cord doesn't disconnect,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:90%
they can yank you back in.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:90%
But when that silver cord--

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
[CLICKS TONGUE]---- disconnects,
then you're a balloon with

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.230 align:middle line:90%
a cut string, and you're gone.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:90%
But I-- I have been--

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I have heard stories of
soldiers who died in the field

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and, not unlike the
indigenous reptoids,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
floated around until they
found a clone of themselves,

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and then rehabitated the clone.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's not something
we're trained to do.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.070 align:middle line:90%
But it has happened.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you arrive
on these missions, what's

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
the sophistication of these
ETs that you're going at?

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It varies.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've--

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I've engaged in missions where
these species there appeared

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:90%
to be rather primitive.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And been places
where they appeared

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to have a comparable, or
possibly slightly more

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:84%
elevated, level of technological
or social civilized development

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:90%
than we have.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Never been to a world that was
so much more advanced than us

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.790 align:middle line:90%
that they would have swatted--

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.360 align:middle line:90%
swatted us away.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time, in the
missions that I was on anyway,

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:84%
were not what I would
call invasion missions.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.420 align:middle line:84%
We were usually going into
areas that were already hot

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.490 align:middle line:84%
with some form of
a conflict that

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
was usually about getting
into somebody else's fight,

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So usually it was helping
an ally, or someone

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that we had a financial
interest with of some kind.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So most-- I think, again, these
are-- the tactical officers

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:90%
make these decisions.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're most often
not going to want

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:84%
to bite off more than they
can chew or we can chew.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So we were pretty
much sent to places

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that were within our scope and
our technological and military

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
advancement to usually
dominate, to be honest with you.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.626 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you ever see
just one race fight itself?

00:33:05.626 --> 00:33:06.478 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh--

00:33:06.478 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like we do here?

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, certainly.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.005 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:33:09.005 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.497 align:middle line:84%
We've come right into the
middle of a couple of civil wars

00:33:11.497 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
before, and in some cases
picked sides, and helped

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:90%
one side dominate another side.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:90%
That's happened.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what was your
position during that mission?

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Most of the
time in those missions,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I was put together with
small special forces teams,

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
with a way more advanced
body armor than what

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:90%
we had in the MDF.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And, again, more than
90% of what we did

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:84%
was high value targets-- either
someone to rescue or someone

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:90%
to kill.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
There were occasional
missions where

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.402 align:middle line:84%
we were sent to locations to
retrieve artifacts or material.

00:33:45.402 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:90%
That did happen occasionally.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:47.410 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What kind of artifacts?

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: You know, we would
get told what that artifact was,

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:84%
get whatever either visual
image, scanning images that we

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:90%
had, and then go get it.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But, to be honest, a lot of
the times, these things looked

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:84%
like rocks, carved stones, you
know, stone eggs with spirals

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:84%
around them or cut edges into
them that if you apparently

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:84%
knew how you could crack the
thing open, and open it up,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.460 align:middle line:90%
and there'd be something inside.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
time they appeared

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
incredibly innocuous,
mundane, and of no importance

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.830 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:84%
But, obviously, that
was not the case

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or we wouldn't have been
spending time, manpower,

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and risking our
lives to get them.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So something very interesting
was going on there.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.072 align:middle line:84%
But I found it very interesting
that, most of the time,

00:34:37.072 --> 00:34:38.780 align:middle line:84%
it just looked like
a rock, or something.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It looked like a--
or a carved piece of stone,

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.304 align:middle line:84%
or a statue, or
something like that.

00:34:43.304 --> 00:34:45.679 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, why did they
pick you for these missions?

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:84%
And what was your position
in these missions?

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, by that
point in my career,

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:84%
I had, again, clawed my
way up to the officer rank.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So I had achieved
Master Sergeant level

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:90%
as an enlisted person.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So I was one of the most
experienced infantry

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and special forces
soldiers that they had.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I was also pilot
trained, and an officer.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So that often put me
in a unique position

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to perform highly
complicated special forces

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:84%
tactical arrangements, tactical
maneuvers, as well as anything

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:84%
that might involve the need
to fly in or out very quickly,

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.032 align:middle line:84%
or commandeer, or be able
to use somebody else's

00:35:25.032 --> 00:35:26.240 align:middle line:90%
ship, or something like that.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So anything that--
any situation that

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
required a group of people
that had those skills

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.820 align:middle line:84%
would typically be
assigned to the team

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:90%
that I was assigned to.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:90%
So, again, it's just--

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.200 align:middle line:90%
that was our specialty.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Was-- it-- again, in
my personal specialty,

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:84%
advanced infantry,
special forces training,

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
flight training, piloting, and
sometimes the additional use

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.990 align:middle line:90%
of psionic abilities.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's a gray area there.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What types of
aircraft did you fly?

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm trained
to fly everything.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So I can fly helicopters, fixed
wing aircraft, spacecraft,

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.180 align:middle line:90%
alien spacecraft.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I can fly just about anything
that we know how to fly.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did some of these
alien spacecraft look like?

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Some of them are--

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.395 align:middle line:90%
look like the ships that--

00:36:19.395 --> 00:36:20.770 align:middle line:84%
saucer craft and
stuff that we've

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:90%
seen in pictures and videos.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.423 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are way
weirder than that.

00:36:26.423 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
how to describe it.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So you end up with some
very strange shapes.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorites
is a teardrop shape.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's kind of got
a rounded front and a teardrop

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:90%
tail to it.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Those look kind of interesting.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I've seen alien craft
that are nothing more

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:90%
than like a giant silver ball.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:55.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's cylinders,
bat wings, saucer craft,

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.520 align:middle line:84%
other interesting
geometric shapes.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.028 align:middle line:84%
Seen like a flying
pyramid before.

00:37:00.028 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the stranger
things that I'd ever seen.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.822 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was basically like a
giant pyramid-shaped spaceship.

00:37:05.822 --> 00:37:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were
some of the propulsion

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.980 align:middle line:90%
units on these things?

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Most of the
time, the propulsion

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.140 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of
electrogravitic and

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.460 align:middle line:90%
magnetogravitic propulsion.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So the electricogravitic
propulsion-- well,

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
the electrogravitic
system basically

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.670 align:middle line:84%
sends a high frequency
electricity charge

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.590 align:middle line:84%
through the fuselage
that makes it weigh less.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.886 align:middle line:90%
So it has less--

00:37:23.886 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
less mass-- literally changes
the mass of the object.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.990 align:middle line:84%
The magnetogravitic
propulsion system

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.780 align:middle line:84%
is really the anti-gravity
drive, the push.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So usually some combination
of those drives.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
There are though some who use
ionic thrusters, warp drive.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.400 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, even
a combination of--

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I've seen combinations
of electrogravitic,

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:84%
magnetogravitic, with chemical
powered rocket propulsion,

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.920 align:middle line:84%
as well, which was a
very strange combination.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.805 align:middle line:84%
But, apparently,
you-- just about--

00:37:59.805 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:84%
again, like so many of
the things, just about

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.360 align:middle line:84%
any combination you could think
of that would be practical,

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:84%
there's probably a
species that has come up

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:90%
with something similar.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did you
actually get to Mars?

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So, like from
point A to point Q there,

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I was in my bedroom,
taken via jump gate

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:25.630 align:middle line:84%
to a spaceport somewhere,
I want to say, probably

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.240 align:middle line:90%
New Mexico, Texas area.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Tierra 3B took us to the moon,
to Luna Operations Command.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.460 align:middle line:84%
After we went through standard
processing protocol, which

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.140 align:middle line:84%
is, you know, medical
screening, psych screening,

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:84%
contract signing, and
then we get deployed.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:84%
We were put on a
large transport,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.900 align:middle line:84%
probably like five stories
high, few hundred meters wide.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
That transport then took out
of a hangar on Lunar Operations

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Command.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And then that ship took
a jump gate to Mars.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Now the ceiling of
the ship essentially

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.230 align:middle line:84%
has a series of screens so
that when they're activated,

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
it's as if you're looking
right at into space above you.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So we were actually able
to see that most of the way

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:14.750 align:middle line:90%
that we went there.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when we came
out the jump gate,

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.260 align:middle line:84%
we're staring at this very
familiar looking red planet.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there was
still some denial going on

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:90%
in my brain.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what's that?

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But then the pilot
said, welcome to Mars.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And we went down and landed
in the tarmac at Aires Premus.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, Randy, thanks for
joining us on the show today.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.970 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to have you on.
