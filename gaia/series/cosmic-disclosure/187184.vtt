>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:10%
we have Sergeant
Clifford Stone with us.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.658 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about advanced technologies.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.618 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Stone,
welcome to the show.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:35.035 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD STONE:
Thank you, sir.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.662 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:39.414 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When did you first
discover that the government

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.292 align:middle line:84%
had actually secret
advanced technology?

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.836 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: We use the term
advanced technologies to cover

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.257 align:middle line:84%
up the fact that some advanced
technologies are not of this

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:49.216 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.011 align:middle line:84%
But it actually starts back
to us at the Second World War.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.349 align:middle line:84%
Both in the European theater and
in the Pacific theater, pilots

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:01.061 align:middle line:84%
were seeing what we
called foo fighters.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Axis powers were
seeing strange objects also,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.316 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure what
they called them.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:10.821 align:middle line:10%
But MacArthur, he wanted to
know what these things were.

00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:14.658 align:middle line:84%
He considered them to
be advanced technology

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:16.785 align:middle line:84%
and, in all
probability, something

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.328 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans
actually came up

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:22.916 align:middle line:84%
with and was sharing with
their allies, the Japanese.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.044 align:middle line:10%
He directed General
Doolittle to try to find out

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.213 align:middle line:10%
what these things were.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And he wanting Doolittle to do
it as quickly and as rapidly

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.926 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.221 align:middle line:84%
Several months later, Doolittle
came back to MacArthur

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.558 align:middle line:84%
and said, Sir,
here's what we have.

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:41.768 align:middle line:84%
We have spectators
to this world event

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:45.689 align:middle line:84%
we call the Second World
War, and they are not

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.524 align:middle line:90%
from this planet.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
We are not sure what
their interests are.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.071 align:middle line:84%
To date, they have
not done anything

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.324 align:middle line:84%
to prove themselves
to be hostile.

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:58.243 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're just
observing right now.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:03.332 align:middle line:84%
But if they are hostile, then
we have grave concern, not just

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:05.959 align:middle line:90%
us, but also the Axis power.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.341 align:middle line:84%
So MacArthur wanted to go
ahead and get pieces of these.

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:17.012 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to go ahead and try
to do something with them.

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:19.473 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I
can say back engineer--

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:22.225 align:middle line:84%
back engineer whatever
it is we came up

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:26.313 align:middle line:84%
with to where we could
use that technology

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:31.985 align:middle line:84%
within our own technology to
create a better weapon system.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.945 align:middle line:90%
Better means to kill the enemy.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.655 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What did
MacArthur find?

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.825 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: They actually
found a damaged craft.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.285 align:middle line:90%
Now, they didn't find no bodies.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.411 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Where?

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.704 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: It was
connected to Thailand.

00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:45.374 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know the
name of the island.

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:49.002 align:middle line:84%
Later on, it became a
airbase from which we

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.047 align:middle line:90%
launched B-29s to attack Japan.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.674 align:middle line:84%
But when he found this,
prior to that time,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:90%
somebody came up on a aircraft--

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.261 align:middle line:90%
a downed aircraft.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.555 align:middle line:84%
Hey, whoever you have out
there, go get the aircraft.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.058 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if they have any
type of new technology.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.143 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was that material
significant in any way

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:06.603 align:middle line:90%
for where we're at today?

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.646 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:14.111 align:middle line:84%
The technology on that craft,
even by today's standards,

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:19.908 align:middle line:84%
is literally tens of thousands
of years ahead of us.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.702 align:middle line:84%
We are still
researching the material

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.454 align:middle line:84%
there because it's
not something when

00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:28.291 align:middle line:84%
it comes to getting
this type of technology

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.503 align:middle line:84%
that you go and a couple
of days later, OK, we

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.546 align:middle line:90%
have some answers.

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.631 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who did he
turn that over to?

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:10%
>> STONE: Well, initially,
early on at this time,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.388 align:middle line:10%
he turned it over to the OSS,
Office of Strategic Services.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:45.267 align:middle line:10%
And what they did with it
at the time, I'm not sure.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
After the Second World War,
the CIA came into being.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.275 align:middle line:10%
And the CIA had
under them what is

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:57.195 align:middle line:10%
known as the Office of
Scientific Intelligence.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.739 align:middle line:10%
Now, they started to look into
these aerial phenomena that

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.324 align:middle line:10%
was taking place.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.661 align:middle line:84%
They concluded that
these objects were real,

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
under intelligent control,
and probably originate

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.087 align:middle line:84%
somewhere out in our own
solar system, Mars or Venus,

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.005 align:middle line:84%
as these were the only
two planets at that time

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:20.302 align:middle line:84%
we recognized as being
capable of supporting life

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.595 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.054 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
they were thinking.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.265 align:middle line:84%
They had no
comprehension that they

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.935 align:middle line:84%
could be coming from
other solar systems

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.022 align:middle line:84%
within our own galaxy
or even other galaxies.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.274 align:middle line:84%
We could not
comprehend at that time

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:84%
that there was means
far vastly greater

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
than, say, atomic engines, which
we figured they'd have to use,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.699 align:middle line:84%
which would take days
or even weeks, depending

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.745 align:middle line:84%
on where Mars and Venus was
in relationship to the Earth.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But there was an advanced
technology there.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.585 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to get
that technology,

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:59.049 align:middle line:84%
develop it to where we had a
working prototype of something,

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:03.094 align:middle line:84%
and then, to avoid suspicion
that, hey, something's

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.889 align:middle line:84%
going on, they're getting
technology that shouldn't

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.351 align:middle line:84%
exist, we would then go
ahead and introduce it

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:14.231 align:middle line:84%
to the various industrial
complexes of our nation

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:90%
and also to major universities.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.988 align:middle line:84%
And we'd say, OK, this is
what we worked out in our R&D,

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:25.867 align:middle line:84%
and working with
certain things to make

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:29.579 align:middle line:84%
for better defenses in the
future of the United States.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.706 align:middle line:84%
So with that happening,
they would go ahead

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:35.418 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, see what
you can come up with.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, now it became a situation
where private industry was

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.884 align:middle line:90%
coming up with the technology.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.804 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, the
military would then

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:49.724 align:middle line:84%
borrow off that technology
to make a better weapon.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.185 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what technologies
are we specifically talking

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.105 align:middle line:84%
about when we're talking
about advanced back engineered

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:55.897 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.482 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, let's
look at the NRO,

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.193 align:middle line:84%
which still holds a
whole lot of secrets.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:05.323 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I want to hit
them up is one big factor.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.493 align:middle line:10%
The NRO, the National
Reconnaissance Organization,

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:15.125 align:middle line:10%
would remain unknown to the
world all the way until 1992.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Congress didn't even know of
its existence until that time.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.383 align:middle line:84%
In 1992, a closed door session
of Congress was saying,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.553 align:middle line:84%
people are accusing
the Department

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:31.641 align:middle line:84%
of Defense of keeping
information from Congress

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.519 align:middle line:84%
that Congress should know
about and should be making

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.563 align:middle line:84%
the decisions on
whether it should really

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:39.774 align:middle line:84%
be kept from the American
public or released.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.235 align:middle line:84%
And they, oh, no, no, no,
no, no, we're not doing that.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.778 align:middle line:84%
But then they finally
had to state--

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:49.451 align:middle line:84%
because it surfaced that there
were agencies within the US

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:56.291 align:middle line:84%
military that was recovering
objects of unknown origin.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.001 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we
went ahead and said,

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.337 align:middle line:84%
well, really, here's
what was happening.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:04.591 align:middle line:84%
We're spying on a potential
future enemy, which

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.345 align:middle line:90%
was the former Soviet states.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:12.557 align:middle line:84%
And when their spacecraft
fall back to Earth,

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:16.269 align:middle line:84%
we immediately try to get
a hold of that spacecraft

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.396 align:middle line:84%
and we go ahead and
try to look at it

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.066 align:middle line:84%
and exploit any
advanced technology

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:25.195 align:middle line:84%
that they might have acquired
for that particular spacecraft.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.572 align:middle line:84%
Then if there is something
that we don't have,

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.075 align:middle line:84%
we then go ahead and
try to exploit it

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.952 align:middle line:84%
to where we now have it
as part of our technology.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.872 align:middle line:84%
But one thing they didn't
tell members of Congress

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.959 align:middle line:84%
was that that was one
aspect of these programs,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
to recover the fallen space
debris of foreign countries.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.509 align:middle line:84%
We did not mention that
we recovered objects

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.178 align:middle line:84%
of unknown origin and
that many of these objects

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:54.057 align:middle line:84%
of unknown origin
were, in fact, debris

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.433 align:middle line:84%
there of or
sometimes whole craft

00:07:56.433 --> 00:08:01.523 align:middle line:84%
with or without alien bodies,
entities from other worlds.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.233 align:middle line:84%
At the time, that's
all we thought about.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:07.112 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know of the
existence of other dimensions.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.571 align:middle line:90%
Now we do.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.699 align:middle line:84%
But we were gathering
this technology.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.159 align:middle line:84%
The NRO was initially
the first ones

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:17.205 align:middle line:84%
that gathered it and
kept very quiet about it.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:21.835 align:middle line:84%
The NRO developed
cameras that really

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:24.879 align:middle line:84%
upset the former Soviet
states because they

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.048 align:middle line:90%
took very good pictures.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:90%
That was an earthly technology.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.095 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
there is one instance

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:40.602 align:middle line:84%
in which a colonel in the Soviet
military was caught on tape.

00:08:40.602 --> 00:08:42.772 align:middle line:84%
They could hear
what he was saying.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:46.568 align:middle line:84%
They caught him and
his mistress in bed,

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.738 align:middle line:84%
and I call it a hotel for
lack of a better term.

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:56.161 align:middle line:84%
We used this to blackmail him
to where we started to get--

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.913 align:middle line:84%
we actually did a
series of documentation

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:90%
called Military Thought.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.296 align:middle line:10%
It was top secret SCI
because it was compartmented.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:10.425 align:middle line:10%
I think it was called Top Secret
Arm Bar or something like that,

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.594 align:middle line:10%
the code word for the SCI.

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:13.595 align:middle line:90%
But we blackmailed him.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:19.684 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't going to be
untrustworthy to his country,

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.061 align:middle line:84%
but yet, he could get
in serious trouble

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:25.273 align:middle line:84%
if all this stuff surfaced,
even with this government

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.233 align:middle line:90%
that he wanted to be loyal to.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.194 align:middle line:90%
So he worked with us.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.738 align:middle line:84%
But this was technology
that even today we

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.115 align:middle line:90%
don't acknowledge existing.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:38.703 align:middle line:84%
From approximately 1,500
miles out in space,

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:42.832 align:middle line:84%
we pinpointed the
hotel where he was at,

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:46.544 align:middle line:84%
we pinpointed the
room he was in.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:50.715 align:middle line:84%
Then we focused in on
that room, catching

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:84%
the words that was being
said In full living color,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we went ahead took
photographs of it,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.015 align:middle line:90%
even though the room was dark.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:03.019 align:middle line:84%
In short, from
1,500 miles high, we

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
were using night
optics because it

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.984 align:middle line:84%
was in a dark room we were
seeing unidentified figures,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:10.985 align:middle line:90%
in that bed.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the whole situation
is we have that technology,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.741 align:middle line:84%
we have technology
that can go ahead--

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.493 align:middle line:84%
and this is going
to be scary and I

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.703 align:middle line:84%
don't think it's ever been
brought up by anyone else,

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.413 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
bring it up now.

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:26.584 align:middle line:84%
We have technology that
from space, we can actually

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:31.506 align:middle line:84%
stop tanks from moving, vehicles
from moving in the abduction

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:32.382 align:middle line:90%
cases.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.424 align:middle line:90%
People are in their cars.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:84%
They see the UFO land and
entities get out of them.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.473 align:middle line:90%
They come over to the vehicle.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:44.227 align:middle line:84%
The people go ahead,
lock their car doors.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.436 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.771 align:middle line:90%
Does no good.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.356 align:middle line:84%
The entities can
open those doors

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:90%
without doing anything to them.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So when the people go ahead
and talk about what happened,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.573 align:middle line:84%
we look at them and,
oh, they're lying.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.448 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
They are describing
an advanced technology

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.789 align:middle line:84%
that even to this day we do
not acknowledge that exists.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.584 align:middle line:90%
We go ahead, we have guns.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:11.254 align:middle line:84%
And many times people seeing
UFOs and seeing the beings,

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
they get frightened,
they'll fire guns.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times they'll actually
work and they'll go off.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:21.097 align:middle line:84%
But if the visitors don't
want those weapons to go off,

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to go off.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But as I learned in Germany,
if you have people that shoot,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the weapon
is, at a UFO or the entities,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.944 align:middle line:84%
keep those weapons
pointed down range.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:38.197 align:middle line:90%
Because as soon as the UFO--

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:42.327 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial
spacecraft and the entities

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:47.582 align:middle line:84%
from some other planet or
reality are no longer there,

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.334 align:middle line:84%
those weapons are
still going to go off.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.376 align:middle line:90%
Reason?

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.254 align:middle line:84%
They went ahead and
manipulated the space time

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.174 align:middle line:84%
in which they were
interacting with those of us

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.468 align:middle line:90%
on this planet at that time.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:02.013 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they take
off, the space time

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:84%
goes back to within
its normal limits

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:12.231 align:middle line:84%
of being us now in our
three dimensional reality.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.734 align:middle line:84%
So you pulled the
trigger to that weapon.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.819 align:middle line:90%
You fired that missile.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:18.863 align:middle line:84%
The situation is,
it's already been

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:22.992 align:middle line:84%
activated before
time was frozen, only

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.037 align:middle line:90%
it didn't seem that way to you.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.163 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.498 align:middle line:90%
Now, can we do this?

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.708 align:middle line:90%
Do we have the technology?

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.835 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:35.588 align:middle line:84%
Do we tell the American people
or anyone else we have it?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.715 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So they're observing us from
far, but at the same time,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.222 align:middle line:90%
we have crashes that do occur.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:48.434 align:middle line:84%
I always say that
crashes are a rarity.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:52.689 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
let me qualify that.

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:56.109 align:middle line:90%
Plane crashes are a rarity here.

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.946 align:middle line:84%
The plane crashes
that we have here

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:03.324 align:middle line:84%
are just because we're
mortal and we make mistakes

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.577 align:middle line:84%
and there's wear and
tear on our technology.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:11.541 align:middle line:84%
Our visitors are just as mortal
as you and I are-- as we are.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.793 align:middle line:84%
They have wear and
tear on their vehicles.

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:17.505 align:middle line:84%
So the number of
accidents you have,

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much you
try to avoid them--

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:25.513 align:middle line:84%
and in the air industry,
we take painstaking steps

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.515 align:middle line:84%
to stop any accidents
from occurring,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:90%
but they still occur.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.686 align:middle line:84%
The number of
accidents you have are

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
proportionate to the
number of flight activities

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle line:90%
you're involved in.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:45.825 align:middle line:84%
Our visitation by the many races
that are visiting us now number

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.786 align:middle line:90%
into the thousands a day.

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:52.123 align:middle line:84%
How many crashes
can come from that?

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You've been on
a lot of retrieval sites.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.007 align:middle line:84%
You also had acquired some
really amazing samples.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.926 align:middle line:84%
What did you bring
today to show us?

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:08.431 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, today, the one
thing I've brought, which--

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.768 align:middle line:84%
this is after a little
more than five years

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:15.104 align:middle line:90%
I was ending my military career.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:17.607 align:middle line:84%
I was stationed at
Fort Gordon, Georgia,

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:23.112 align:middle line:84%
and they said they had a
crash of an unknown aircraft.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:27.492 align:middle line:84%
We went out to the area
where that craft took place,

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.411 align:middle line:84%
and we even took some
of the people who

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:33.748 align:middle line:84%
were learning to be military
police officers because that's

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:36.667 align:middle line:84%
actually where I worked with
DBLET, the Department of Basic

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.711 align:middle line:90%
Law Enforcement Training.

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
On this field, there
were strange rocks.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.093 align:middle line:90%
We knew they were metal rocks.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:48.554 align:middle line:84%
And we're wondering, how
did all this get there?

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:53.309 align:middle line:84%
They gave us burlap sacks to go
out and pick up all this metal.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.228 align:middle line:84%
But they had something
about like 50,

00:14:55.228 --> 00:15:00.399 align:middle line:84%
60 people in a line walking
and picking up these pieces.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:05.446 align:middle line:84%
As I went out, I thought, you
know what, this is probably

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.073 align:middle line:84%
my last time I'm
going to have anything

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.825 align:middle line:90%
to do with anything like this.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.535 align:middle line:90%
The lapse is on me, of course.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:13.412 align:middle line:84%
But with this being
the case, I wanted

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:19.001 align:middle line:84%
to have something that later
on I could show my family,

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.045 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
going to be laughing

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.964 align:middle line:90%
at me about what happened.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:27.093 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead
and looked around,

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.761 align:middle line:84%
trying to make sure
no one's looking.

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.012 align:middle line:90%
Now, remember, we're together.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:30.805 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:34.058 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, I went ahead
and I fell back on purpose.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:35.768 align:middle line:90%
And everyone was moving ahead.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.478 align:middle line:84%
Of course, everyone's
doing their job,

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:40.148 align:middle line:84%
trying to make sure they
didn't miss no piece.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.108 align:middle line:90%
I didn't miss this piece.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:46.362 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up very
quietly, put it my boot.

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make
sure I had something.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.494 align:middle line:84%
And this piece right
here, it's heavy.

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:55.496 align:middle line:84%
You can tell it's been
exposed to a lot of heat.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.754 align:middle line:84%
I know from some people
who I have contact with

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.048 align:middle line:84%
and I'm friends with,
some of the testing

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:13.556 align:middle line:84%
they did on it, that there is
some unique properties to it.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:17.268 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends at one
time experienced a situation

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:21.856 align:middle line:84%
where it's not magnetic,
but then it became magnetic.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:29.572 align:middle line:84%
He had some pieces of a craft
that they were working on,

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:33.618 align:middle line:84%
a very earthly craft
but very advanced.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:37.705 align:middle line:84%
They went ahead and
they were not magnetic.

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:39.707 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of a sudden,
I said, I thought

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:41.792 align:middle line:90%
you said this wasn't magnetic.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:42.585 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I said, well what about--

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.672 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we had
those pieces together.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So this was magnetic
sometimes and sometimes it

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:49.175 align:middle line:90%
wasn't.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.761 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Sometimes it's
magnetic, sometimes it's not.

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:54.722 align:middle line:90%
It made those pieces magnetic.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:17:02.396 align:middle line:84%
It would also change the
polarity of a magnet,

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:07.693 align:middle line:84%
and that requires a tremendous
amount of energy to do that.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:10.363 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So the red is north,
and this is just a regular

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.321 align:middle line:90%
compass.

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to now put the
specimen next to the compass

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.204 align:middle line:84%
to see if it moves
it or effects it.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:90%
And it surely does.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.415 align:middle line:90%
North is the red part.

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:23.751 align:middle line:10%
So we're going off north now.

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.627 align:middle line:10%
So that should go back to north.

00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:27.672 align:middle line:10%
But when we bring
this up, it seems

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:35.763 align:middle line:10%
to have definitely the
power to change the compass.

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:40.434 align:middle line:84%
Now we know there's definitely
some magnetic energy in here

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:47.149 align:middle line:84%
that is pulling on this
very delicate instrument.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:50.444 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
repelling from one side

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:53.698 align:middle line:84%
and trapping from
the other, it seems.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:08.921 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if I can
chase that around.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.132 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:16.345 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: What I find real
interesting is that there is

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
also a carbon compound
that they can't identify.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.353 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
time I've mentioned that.

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.896 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I never
heard you say that.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:32.945 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: So it makes
it a very strong copper.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.573 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how to explain that.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:38.451 align:middle line:84%
Like I've said before,
I'm not a scientist.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:43.039 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like a child
in a candy store.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:48.252 align:middle line:84%
I'm inquisitive, but I
have so many questions

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:50.338 align:middle line:90%
to which I have no answers for.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:53.299 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It has these
gold particles in it.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.885 align:middle line:90%
I've noticed a color.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.637 align:middle line:84%
You think that
might be something?

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.639 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: There's
something to it.

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:07.938 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it's part of the
mystery of this piece of metal.

00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:13.986 align:middle line:84%
I got a lot of questions
even to this day about this

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.738 align:middle line:90%
for which I have no answers.

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:19.116 align:middle line:84%
I've had this well
over 40 years now.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:21.869 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even share
it with the family.

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I shared with one cousin.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.333 align:middle line:84%
I shared with one
friend, and my one friend

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.252 align:middle line:84%
had to keep it until
I got re-situated back

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:32.088 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.547 align:middle line:84%
And I was scared
to death if I ever

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:38.511 align:middle line:84%
mentioned it, to keep it
quiet, to get it back.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:44.308 align:middle line:84%
In short, you felt like you
were a criminal because you were

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.812 align:middle line:84%
in possession of something
that you had no right to be

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:53.651 align:middle line:84%
in possession of,
even though I thought

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.237 align:middle line:84%
I had a right to let
my family and others

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.906 align:middle line:84%
know what I'm talking
about is real,

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:01.158 align:middle line:84%
I had a right to
go ahead and have

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:04.912 align:middle line:84%
some proof that these
things happened to me.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:08.541 align:middle line:84%
And this gave me
some permutation

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.501 align:middle line:84%
on things that
happened in my life.

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:14.046 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever shown
this to the public ever?

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.382 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: No, I'm not very
good about giving a whole lot

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:90%
of interviews.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.387 align:middle line:84%
But I went ahead and
I showed some people.

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:22.221 align:middle line:90%
Then they filmed it.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.765 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
was a couple times that

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:28.144 align:middle line:84%
was shown as a result of
them taking photographs of it

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:28.936 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:34.775 align:middle line:84%
But I'll say that that was in a
foreign country that was shown.

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:38.821 align:middle line:84%
Here, I showed a couple
of my close friends.

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.114 align:middle line:90%
I'll come right out and say it.

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:42.575 align:middle line:10%
I went ahead and I
showed it to Paola,

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.703 align:middle line:10%
and she got to take pictures.

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:48.914 align:middle line:10%
If Paola hasn't showed it
to anybody and anything--

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:52.251 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't go ahead and
say, under penalty of death,

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.796 align:middle line:10%
don't do anything with it.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:21:00.426 align:middle line:84%
If she hasn't showed it to
no one, no one has seen this.

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:04.555 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
this is being presented

00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:08.476 align:middle line:84%
in an atmosphere where
the potential exists

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:13.647 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people are going
to see it as a result of seeing

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:17.151 align:middle line:90%
this episode of this program.

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:19.236 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, we thank
you for that, Sarge.

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.989 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: My friend also went
ahead and said that he could

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:26.368 align:middle line:90%
sense it having a personality.

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.871 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- oh, I didn't fully
understand at that time what

00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:30.623 align:middle line:90%
he's trying to say.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.792 align:middle line:84%
Then I had another lady who
came here to visit with me.

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:34.585 align:middle line:90%
She had it.

00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:39.423 align:middle line:84%
She says, you know what,
I feel that that object

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:43.886 align:middle line:84%
there has a personality
all of its own,

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:47.181 align:middle line:90%
like it's something living.

00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:50.434 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you're the second
person that told me that.

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:53.395 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to
think about it.

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:57.316 align:middle line:84%
And I never felt that
way, or so I thought.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.734 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
times that I've

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:02.947 align:middle line:84%
been around where it was
just me and this object,

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:06.075 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, I felt
that I was being watched.

00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
shake that at all.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.248 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: There is, after
holding this just for a few

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.791 align:middle line:90%
minutes now, a--

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:15.543 align:middle line:84%
I know it's going to
sound a little weird,

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.629 align:middle line:90%
but I can feel it vibrating.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:19.797 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Oh, yes.

00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:21.465 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's
happened to you before?

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: Oh, yes.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.427 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: This, guys,
is vibrating right now.

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:26.887 align:middle line:84%
Sarge, what do you
mean you thought

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:30.349 align:middle line:90%
you were being watched by this?

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:33.644 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: I felt like I was
no longer alone in the room.

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:38.691 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there was
someone else or something

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:42.653 align:middle line:84%
that had an interest
and focus on me

00:22:42.653 --> 00:22:46.282 align:middle line:84%
and like you feel like somebody
is breathing down your neck.

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I went ahead and
I looked around.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.535 align:middle line:90%
No one's in there.

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:52.413 align:middle line:84%
But I could not shake
the belief that there

00:22:52.413 --> 00:22:53.956 align:middle line:90%
was somebody else in there.

00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:55.499 align:middle line:90%
At times I even got up.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:58.043 align:middle line:84%
It was so strong
that I went looking

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:01.964 align:middle line:84%
to see if there somebody trying
to maybe fool me or something,

00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:04.258 align:middle line:90%
jump out and say boo.

00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:07.428 align:middle line:90%
I went looking for the person.

00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:10.055 align:middle line:84%
But I found out
something interesting.

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:15.436 align:middle line:84%
The further I got away from
that object there, the less I

00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:16.478 align:middle line:90%
had that feeling.

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:18.856 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Sarge, are you saying
there's sentience in this

00:23:18.856 --> 00:23:21.025 align:middle line:90%
material?

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: I really don't know,
but I'll put it this way.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.867 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the Native
Americans of this country

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:32.036 align:middle line:84%
knew a whole lot
more than we knew.

00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:35.205 align:middle line:84%
In short, the Native
Americans, for the most part,

00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:39.918 align:middle line:84%
believe that everything
has a spirit.

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:42.588 align:middle line:84%
And from time to
time, the spirit

00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
of these inanimate
objects interact with us.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.429 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they knew what they
were talking about and we are

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:84%
just too sophisticated
that we cannot accept that.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:01.899 align:middle line:84%
I believe that everything
is interconnected, living,

00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:03.776 align:middle line:90%
organic, non-organic.

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:06.028 align:middle line:90%
We're all interconnected.

00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:11.533 align:middle line:84%
And the situation is that I
know that our visitors have

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:13.452 align:middle line:90%
an artificial technology.

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:16.622 align:middle line:84%
Well, that artificial
technology is

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it has
taken on a life of its own.

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:24.672 align:middle line:84%
When it ceases to exist,
what happens to that energy?

00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:29.677 align:middle line:84%
We have a body, but
there's a life force.

00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:33.222 align:middle line:84%
And we normally refer to
that life force as a soul.

00:24:33.222 --> 00:24:36.934 align:middle line:90%
Once again, this is an energy.

00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:40.521 align:middle line:84%
And I firmly believe
that that life force

00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:44.817 align:middle line:90%
survives physical death.

00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:50.948 align:middle line:84%
How can we say that
other things don't also

00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:58.372 align:middle line:84%
survive the physical demise of
whatever that object might be?

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:00.249 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We call that
consciousness-assisted

00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.546 align:middle line:84%
And we also believe
in the projects,

00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:08.465 align:middle line:84%
like you just said, if it
has energy and everything is

00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:12.094 align:middle line:84%
energy, then it can
actually be tapped into,

00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:14.763 align:middle line:90%
whether it's a plant or a rock.

00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:18.434 align:middle line:84%
Just because you might
think it's dead, it's not.

00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:22.062 align:middle line:84%
When I actually picked this
up for the very first time,

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:26.859 align:middle line:84%
I noticed right away it was
not as heavy as a meteorite,

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:27.943 align:middle line:90%
but just below that.

00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:30.821 align:middle line:84%
It was very heavy for
the density and the size

00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:32.406 align:middle line:90%
of what it is right now.

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:37.035 align:middle line:84%
I also noticed markings
on half of the edges that

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:41.248 align:middle line:84%
were striations that looked
like a separate piece of melted

00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:46.962 align:middle line:84%
on metal on this other piece
of the rock, we'll say.

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:49.298 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Well, I've
noticed that also.

00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:53.802 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that that
was put there by design.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:55.387 align:middle line:84%
It's not an accident
that it's there.

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.805 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: No, that
was put there.

00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:59.975 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: And I have no
idea what it's all about,

00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
but I noticed that I tried to
figure out what it's all about.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:11.028 align:middle line:84%
At times I thought, well,
someone cut pieces off this.

00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:90%
What's the story there?

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.822 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have no idea.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:17.576 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: My next question
is, what's your plan for this?

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.578 align:middle line:90%
>> STONE: I really don't know.

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:26.043 align:middle line:84%
I have seen so many times
when people had really, really

00:26:26.043 --> 00:26:29.546 align:middle line:84%
real things, and the
government let us have them

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:32.674 align:middle line:90%
and we'll do an analysis of it.

00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:35.344 align:middle line:84%
Then they come back and
state, there's nothing to it.

00:26:35.344 --> 00:26:36.929 align:middle line:90%
Here's your piece of metal back.

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:40.307 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not the same
metal and people know that.

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:41.433 align:middle line:90%
But prove it.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:45.062 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's true when
civilians or ex military

00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:48.982 align:middle line:84%
or even if you're active
duty and you bring something,

00:26:48.982 --> 00:26:51.485 align:middle line:84%
even if it's your personal
stuff, to be tested.

00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:53.278 align:middle line:84%
They will always
replicate it, take it,

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.738 align:middle line:84%
and then give you
the replica back.

00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:58.534 align:middle line:84%
And it's terrible
because a lot of people

00:26:58.534 --> 00:27:02.329 align:middle line:84%
have come forward with
this type of specimen

00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:90%
and it just never goes anywhere.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.545 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: This, I have never
went ahead and let anyone take

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:90%
it to a laboratory.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very protective of this.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.593 align:middle line:90%
I don't keep this at the house.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to make that
perfectly clear.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.098 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody
comes to try to decide

00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:22.641 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go
get that piece back

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.059 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to go to his house

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:29.022 align:middle line:84%
and get it when he's not there,
no, it's not going to be there.

00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:30.941 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Sarge, it
seems to be melted.

00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.529 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: I know for a fact that
it was exposed to temperatures

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:39.324 align:middle line:84%
that exceeded 5,000
degrees centigrade.

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:40.492 align:middle line:90%
Why it was melted?

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:44.454 align:middle line:84%
Like I say again, I'm not a
scientist, I don't know why.

00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:46.748 align:middle line:84%
I can speculate,
but it's speculation

00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:49.668 align:middle line:84%
on my part, in that
I believe there

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:53.338 align:middle line:84%
was some type of explosion
that made all these pieces.

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:57.175 align:middle line:84%
And that could explain
the fact that it

00:27:57.175 --> 00:28:00.554 align:middle line:84%
appears to be exposed to a
tremendous amount of heat.

00:28:00.554 --> 00:28:03.181 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe in
order to go ahead and have

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:07.144 align:middle line:84%
that type of explosion
with these exotic advanced

00:28:07.144 --> 00:28:12.316 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft, that that will
generate a lot of energy and it

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:16.653 align:middle line:84%
will generate a lot of
heat when this happens.

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's
also really dense,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:22.034 align:middle line:84%
which makes me think that this
actually could have happened

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:23.243 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:25.704 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
these explosions in space

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and the vacuum of space,
things are very dense when

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.001 align:middle line:90%
they get back down to Earth.

00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:33.337 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: I might be inclined
to agree with you on that.

00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:34.421 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:36.798 align:middle line:84%
Because to the best of my
knowledge, at that time,

00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:41.845 align:middle line:84%
even up to today, no one
reported any sonic boom or what

00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:44.473 align:middle line:90%
sounded like a loud explosion.

00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:48.852 align:middle line:84%
It's just when we got out
there, there was this debris.

00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:53.273 align:middle line:84%
And adding a footnote
to that, I think

00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:55.943 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people in the
US government that are in the

00:28:55.943 --> 00:29:00.614 align:middle line:84%
know are really glad
that, when this exploded

00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever happened to it and
all these pieces fell to Earth,

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.289 align:middle line:84%
that they're really glad it fell
in that field there as opposed

00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:11.959 align:middle line:90%
to falling on a populated area.

00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:13.543 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Fascinating,
Sergeant Stone.

00:29:13.543 --> 00:29:15.712 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming on the show.

00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> STONE: Once again, it's been
my great pleasure to be here.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.424 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.718 align:middle line:84%
This is another episode
of "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:23.095 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:26.473 align:middle line:90%
