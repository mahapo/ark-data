00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Interdimensional
beings-- are they ghosts?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Are they extraterrestrial?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:90%
What exactly are they?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.819 align:middle line:90%
Emery Smith, welcome back.

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY SMITH: Thanks, George.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Emery, when we talk
about interdimensional beings,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:90%
what are we talking about?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: We're talking about
a race of beings hundreds

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:10%
of millions of years ahead of
us that have already been able

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:10%
to master how to
change their form.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
They are allowed to switch
their atoms and photons around

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to take almost any form
they want and travel

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:84%
It can go from a light
body to a 3D body.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
It can change its
frequency at will

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:90%
to go to another dimension.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:84%
It can phase in, phase
out, bleed in, bleed out

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:90%
of multiple dimensions.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
That makes it an
interdimensional being.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: At any time?

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: At any
time by its own will.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.354 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are they physical,
or are they somewhat ghostlike?

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I get that a lot, because a lot
of these sightings and things--

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
people are referring
to them as ghosts,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
or people report ghosts being
seen when they're really

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:90%
these interdimensional beings.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
science behind this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
is that when an interdimensional
being enters our dimension,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
he falls under the laws of
our three-dimensional reality.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So he has to take
some sort of form.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget,
light is form, too.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:10%
So that can be visualized
by our five senses

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:10%
here on planet Earth, or
through our solar system

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:10%
in this universe,
in this dimension.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So as they come through, they
might change from a light being

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
into a form of their
choice, or they also

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:90%
could stay in the light form.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So many accounts that you've
heard in history books

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and around the planet of these
ghostlike sightings-- now,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:90%
some are ghosts.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Which means if you were
to pass away right now,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
your photons will still be in
that chair for 30 days or more.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
I'm getting at--

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
the photons of the
genetic makeup of the DNA

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:90%
is always there.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Even when we leave
our seats right now

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and come back tomorrow morning,
we're still going to have--

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
our resident energy's
still going to be here.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: How do these
interdimensional beings, Emery,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.024 align:middle line:84%
kind of come
through to get here?

00:02:48.024 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right, we hear
about this bleeding through

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:90%
the dimensions.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And how that is is because they
are allowed to change form--

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:84%
their frequency;
sound before form.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.615 align:middle line:84%
By changing frequency-- and
everything's a frequency--

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:90%
our DNA.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Everything around
us is a frequency

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of some sort that can be
measured scientifically.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So they can actually
vibrate themselves

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and change their frequency
and disappear right here,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and not be seen but still
be here in some form.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like an advanced
teletransportation system.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.415 align:middle line:90%
Think of it that way.

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are they coming
through a gateway or a portal?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Nope.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
They have mastered
the ability to vibrate

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
at a frequency for
different dimensions.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So there might be many
dimensions right here right now

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
around us, and because they
can change their frequency,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
they can be in that
dimension right now.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there's
no time or space.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere in the present
is right now, right here.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're not traveling
over millions of light years

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:90%
to get here.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
higher dimensional beings

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.275 align:middle line:84%
that are able to do
this type of science.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: There was an
old classic "Twilight Zone"

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
episode called
"Little Girl Lost,"

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and it was about a little girl
who somehow fell out of her bed

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Is that kind of like it is?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, there are areas
around the planet and areas

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
that can open up where these
energies of the different

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
dimensions sometimes fall within
the same frequency and they

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:90%
overlap.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
these little gateways--

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
these openings to
other dimensions--

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Like in the old saying around
Halloween and October--

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
"The worlds are at
their thinnest."

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And it allows these ghostlike
creatures to come through,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:90%
and you can visit your family.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
to that being said

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial technology
with these interdimensional

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And it also has to do with
different parts of the planet

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
have these openings
there all the time.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:90%
So things can form.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
They can open up a gateway--
especially ET craft--

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Sure.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.978 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH:
--interdimensional craft.

00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when they
open up a small area,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.121 align:middle line:84%
well, that could
stay open for a while

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
when a craft comes through it.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:90%
It might stay there.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: What if it closes?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:90%
What if it closes?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.119 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Right,
what if it closes?

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: And you're in there?

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.802 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, your frequency
probably will stay there.

00:05:12.802 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now, these
interdimensional beings--

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.062 align:middle line:90%
are they biological at all?

00:05:16.062 --> 00:05:17.645 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, of
course, absolutely.

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:20.316 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget-- sound,
light, and form.

00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But when they come here,
they can take a form

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
if they choose to, or they
can stay in the light form.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It's up to them how they want
to frequency vibrate here

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and how they want
to show whoever

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:90%
they're communicating with.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they want to only
communicate through sound,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and you hear tonalities.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
The study that we
have that we've

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
gone through with other
extraterrestrial beings

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that it's more of a
tonality, but they're there.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.975 align:middle line:84%
You can't see them,
but you can hear them.

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: A lot
of times, Emery,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
we get stories and reports of
these interdimensional beings,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
but they always
seem to be alone.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
You never seem to hear stories
of them coming in pairs, or 10

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:90%
of them, or 20.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, that's
not my experience.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of these
interdimensional beings

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
have traveled through
time and space

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and have been able to open
up right in a fabric of time

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and space, and
you might just see

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
a small ping pong ball
of light, and that

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:90%
could be a whole civilization.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Really?

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because there is no
size when it comes to these

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional beings.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think about
the physics and science behind

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that-- of how to represent
that when we're educating

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
the public--

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.679 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
size to anything

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking about
interdimensional beings

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
because they are able to
shift their atomic structure

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:90%
into light.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on for millions

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
of years on planet Earth,
and the way they communicate

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:84%
is like I was just talking
about earlier about tonalities

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies, and also taking
the manifestation form of maybe

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
a human being, and then helping
us get more technologies

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.111 align:middle line:84%
and giving us ideas of
how to improve ourselves.

00:07:10.111 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are we are
interacting with them with

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
technology, or is it
more consciousness?

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, consciousness is
the basis for all communication

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and for all the science
behind interdimensional

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and multidimensional creatures.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.855 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
devices that they

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:29.165 align:middle line:84%
are working on to spot these
people and these beings--

00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: High technology?

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Very high technology--

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:10%
such as the neutrino
light detectors

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:10%
and the satellites that pick
up subtle changes in light.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:10%
These things allow us
to see these beings

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:10%
and see their craft
when they're cloaked.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.325 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Almost like
night vision goggles?

00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: A lot
better than that,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
but that's also
reverse-engineered from

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial capture.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Exactly.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Are interdimensional
beings different

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:90%
from extraterrestrials?

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Interdimensional
beings are extraterrestrials,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of like we are
extraterrestrials

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:90%
in our genetics.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.425 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to
that is they are

00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
one of the most advanced
extraterrestrials

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
in our dimension
here in our society.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: How evolved are they?

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They're
the most evolved.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.997 align:middle line:90%
They can change from--

00:08:15.997 --> 00:08:17.955 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: They're at
the top of the pole, huh?

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: --physical to light.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They can travel anywhere,
any time, and any place.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So they're very mature, and
they're very conscious beings.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
People who see angels
and things like this,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I really believe these are
the interdimensional beings.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
We've all been
programmed since day one.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Many of us growing up
in religious families

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:84%
and reading the
Bible and reading

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
stories about fairies and angels
and trolls and these things.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So the best way for us to
comprehend this is to--

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
when you don't believe
in another race

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrial, well, when
you see something like that,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to put it
into your own words,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and your mind's going to
come up with its own vision

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and its own answer to that.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of
this is how else am I

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.624 align:middle line:84%
going to explain this
beautiful light being

00:09:04.624 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:90%
that's in front of me?

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course, it's an angel.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
learned growing up.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
If we don't exist, I don't
think they're going to exist.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the genetics that
we have tested on many beings

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
have a direct relation
to our own human DNA.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, why are beings
10,000, 100,000 years more

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:84%
advanced than us
have our DNA in them?

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Even though they have mutated
over millions of years,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a hodgepodge,
George, of planet Earth.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the races we
have, and all the continents.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And the species of
animals, and everything else.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.245 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, and the species
and all of us interacting

00:09:45.245 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
as humans and flourishing around
the Earth and having different

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:90%
types of races intermingle.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of that
on a universal scale.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Think of--

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Oh, that could be
just tremendous if you could

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.327 align:middle line:90%
harness it.

00:10:00.327 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And then animal
species and the mammal species

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and the human species
intermingling,

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and then we go amongst the
stars in the next 1,000 years

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and intermingle with
other human-like beings.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: In the programs you
have been in, have there ever

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:84%
been any ways where they've
communicated with these

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.230 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional beings
that you know of?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I've worked
with some extraterrestrials that

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
might have been
interdimensional,

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
but they had a form.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these beings
were just communicating

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
the way I communicate with
you, but telepathically.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And telepathy is a
type of communication.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of a
language that you

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
have to learn when you're
working in these projects

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
with these beings, because
telepathy is based off

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your frequency and
emotional state as a human

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm really upset and I
walk into an operating room

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and I am assisting a physician
and an extraterrestrial

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and I had a really bad
day and I just say,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
"Hello," it's more
like, (GRUFFLY) "Hello."

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:90%
They pick up on the emotion.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really
clear your mind

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.147 align:middle line:84%
and clear your spirit before
entering into these projects

00:11:13.147 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
when you're going to
start your day to work,

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
because they pick
up on all the stuff.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are kind
of are in your mind,

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
because they have the ability
to know everything you already

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's no secrets
with these beings.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Some people have
said that these beings are not

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:90%
benevolent.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's a possibility.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I only know one really
evil race of beings,

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's the human race
here on the planet Earth,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
because we kill each other.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But I have not been subjected
to an evil race of beings

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
yet that I have worked with
or I've seen or intermingled.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.832 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that there
aren't, because if we are,

00:11:57.832 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:90%
then there's got to be more--

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Yeah,
some have to be evil.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: --more of us, yeah.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
There's always got to be some
evil intention out there.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe in a type
of galactic federation

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that does not allow
beings that are

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:84%
going to do bad things
to go amongst the stars.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We've been quarantined
to our planet

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
until we get a little
bit more conscious

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.981 align:middle line:84%
and take care of the
planet and each other.

00:12:19.981 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
we'll be able to go

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
amongst the stars in
a conscious effort

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
to work with other
extraterrestrials

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:90%
and other societies.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: They're told not to
come here and annihilate us?

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I think what's going on is
they, too, George, were once us,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and they had to go
through this, too.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
They had to become
more conscious

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and take care of the planet
and take care of each other.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
As a parent, you would
look on your children,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and yeah, you're going to say
you did bad, but at same time,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
you were there once
too, so you know

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:84%
there is this learning
and this maturity

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.839 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go through
before you get there.

00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think we were
already supposed

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
to be there 100 years ago, but
because we have this control

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:90%
factor--

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
there's many planets out
there that started around

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
the same time we did, and
they're a lot more advanced

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
than we are because
they didn't have

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
this control factor of these
corporations and people trying

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.691 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Too much greed here.

00:13:23.691 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, too much greed
got in control of this planet.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And we're working through that.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And what we do here affects
planets all over the place.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to
your question is

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:84%
they want us to evolve in
a safe and effective way,

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
but they also don't want
us to blow up the planet

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:90%
or destroy each other.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Why would these
interdimensional beings come

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:90%
here in the first place?

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They come here
because the planet is so diverse

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and dynamic, unlike
other planets,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:84%
with the water and the
air and all the species--

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:84%
down to the bacteria and the
phytoplankton and the oceans.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.864 align:middle line:90%
So they come here to see this.

00:14:05.864 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand, the
Earth has been visited forever

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and ever and ever.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Of course.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Many times.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.295 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Of course.

00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So we have
a history, Earth,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:90%
that we have to uphold to.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Which, we've been here
millions of years,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.919 align:middle line:84%
and so the visitations
are still coming,

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
they're just coming
from a little bit

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
further away, because it's not
so safe to come here anymore

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
because we'll blow
them out of the sky.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And they know this is
happening, but they're hoping

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:90%
things are going to change.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Interdimensional
beings and plasma beings--

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:90%
are they the same thing?

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Well, plasma--

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:84%
this is another form, like
air and water and gas.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Plasma is this fourth state.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And it can form into that.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:90%
It can be part of these beings--

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:90%
a plasma state.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But to say that the
being is all plasma--

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: That's not the case.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: How do they
interact with each other?

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Do they?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Do they have emotion?

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.783 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:00.783 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:90%
They have emotion.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:90%
They're very comical.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And just like I'm
speaking to you,

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
they just do it through
frequencies and tonalities

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:90%
and telepathy.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the beings that
you might see in pop culture--

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
they have really small
feet, and they only

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:90%
have a really small mouth.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of these beings-- they
don't need a digestive system,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
because they can form the
nutrients just from thin air.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Do they procreate?

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only do you have
little entities,

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:90%
these beings also have pets.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
They have many
different species,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
like we do here
on the Earth, that

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.027 align:middle line:90%
are used for companionship.

00:15:36.027 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Do they have emotion?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, they do.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
These beings-- when
you get around someone

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:84%
that's really loving and fun
and bubbly, it rubs off on you.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:90%
When you--

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Oh, you can feel it.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.115 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Go out
with your friends.

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: It's infectious.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.059 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's very infectious.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to make
you feel like that instantly--

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously--
if they wanted to.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do they ever come
through to this dimension where

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
we are, and they look like
us, and you would not know

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:90%
the difference?

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They're walking
around the planet right now,

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and you would not
know the difference.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I get this question where
people are like, well,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.969 align:middle line:84%
what's the little
quirks they have

00:16:14.969 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:90%
that you could figure this out?

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Yeah, do they
have elongated heads,

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And some of
them, I have to admit,

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe their ears are just
a little bit different,

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's just something
different that you notice that

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
you don't usually see
on normal human beings.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Eyes different?

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:90%
A little twinkle in the eye?

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.269 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Eyes might be
a little bit different--

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
little bit bigger,
little bit further away,

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.079 align:middle line:90%
little things like that.

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
impossible just to--

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
unless you've been
in these projects

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and have really studied the
morphology of these beings--

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to really know if-- if they
were sitting right next to you,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't know.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Or walking through New York
streets, you wouldn't know.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But working around
them, you might

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:84%
catch on a little bit on
physical characteristics

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and quirks like
that, but you would

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:84%
have to be around them for a
while to pick that up, I think.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are governments
and secret programs,

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
corporations working with
them for any specific reason?

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I know
they're working with them

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
in the projects to assist with
technologies and engineering

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and geological things
that they need help with.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Some have been captured and
have decided to stay with us.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:84%
That being said, I think
it's a positive thing

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
to show a species from another
planet coming here to help just

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:90%
work with us by volunteering.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now, when I hear the
word interdimensional, Emery,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:90%
I think of something multiverse.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that conceivable?

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're
talking about?

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, multi-dimensional
just means

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:84%
there's different dimensions,
and interdimensional

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.204 align:middle line:84%
is the actual going from
one place to another.

00:17:56.204 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: To another.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And the multiverses
that you hear about on TV

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and science is that.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the different
dimensions that

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
are overlying each other
right here, right now.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.317 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to get there
is by changing your frequency.

00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And the gateways,
again, fascinate me--

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
these portals that
may be out there.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The military builds
bases on different ley lines

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, and they use
these areas because the energy

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
signatures have been shown that
these are gateways to other

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:90%
places in the universe.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Places that we want
to go, or places that we don't?

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.856 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, that's
not for me to say.

00:18:38.856 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
All's I know is there's
these portals that

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:84%
are around the planet-- and in
the oceans-- that are protected

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
that they're testing,
and they are using these,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and craft are coming
in and out of these.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Not to say there are
craft, by the way.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But they are monitoring
these, and they're

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to reverse-engineer
these and duplicate these.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:90%
And there's lots of--

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in the classified projects,
lots of videos, documentation,

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and pictures and briefings on
how these devices work, but it

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
energy of the planet

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:90%
is how they are operational.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's some way
to turn them on and off.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are ancient
structures here

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that are
just always ongoing.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
What's not to say that
we haven't explored--

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
definitely the oceans
that much here--

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that there's other
areas that are maybe

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:84%
always on and active
that maybe a craft flying

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:84%
over the Bermuda Triangle
all of a sudden disappears?

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Who knows?

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: --what's
going on, here?

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So there could be these
rifts in time and space

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that, during certain
astrological times

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, that
these things open up

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.655 align:middle line:90%
and things go missing.

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: And close.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right, and close.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.394 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: And Close.

00:19:52.394 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's tie this back
into secret programs.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along
the line, I think,

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
governments are
aware of the ability

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:84%
to travel in space through
portals or time warps.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They know about these
entities-- these beings.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Something else is going
on here, don't you think?

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I think it's limited
to a very few governmental

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:84%
agencies, militaries, or even
presidents of many countries.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's a
widely known thing.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I know, just like we have our
compartmentalized projects,

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
military doesn't know
what they're doing,

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
but they might be investigating
something themselves

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:90%
on a lower--

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Sure.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The military is
usually the security for all

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
these compartmentalized
programs.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
When people are
like, oh, Smith was

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
claiming he worked at Sandia
Labs and Los Alamos Labs--

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:90%
no, they didn't write my check.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I was working underground
in that facility

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:84%
where each floor is rented out
by a different corporation.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Gosh.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.544 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: So I mean--

00:20:58.544 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: How long
were you down there?

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I was in the
military for seven years,

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was only in the
projects for about four.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Did you stay
down there almost 24/7, or--

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, no.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a 9:00 to 5:00 job
that I would report to.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Oh, so you could
come up to the surface and--

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, yes.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.274 align:middle line:84%
There was only a
few times that I

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
got locked down there because
they had incidents and things

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.012 align:middle line:84%
were going south for
whatever security reasons,

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and you might have to spend
the night there a couple nights

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.511 align:middle line:90%
until it gets cleared up.

00:21:23.511 --> 00:21:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: If interdimensional
beings are coming here,

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:90%
are we going there?

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Like I said, because
the portal technology that I

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
was exposed to and
the time travel stuff,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
we're definitely
traveling somewhere.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where exactly.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: You haven't gone.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where we're going.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been through
portals and time travel--

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: But not
other dimensions.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.302 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But not other
dimensions that I'm aware of.

00:21:49.302 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now, what
do you mean by that?

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, sometimes
you might go somewhere--

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
even just going to work on
some of these maglev devices

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that you hear about
in pop culture--

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:84%
sometimes things
happen and you end up

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
in a place that doesn't
look so natural compared

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:90%
to like it would on Earth.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Will we ever get
help from these interdimensional

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, I
really believe that.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if more than
half of the Earth's population's

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:90%
going to be compromised--

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.054 align:middle line:84%
which, one nuclear
warhead, it would be--

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: If a major
destruction of the planet

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.340 align:middle line:84%
because of earthquakes or other
things were going to happen

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
where, like I said, more than
a third of the Earth would be

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
destroyed, I do believe they
would definitely intervene--

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
which they have done on and
off in times where volcanoes

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:90%
and earthquakes were going off.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:10%
People would always
see these ships

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:10%
coming in out of
the volcanoes when

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:10%
it's happening, because
they're trying to neutralize

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:10%
the cataclysmic event.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think they would
definitely intervene

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
if something like
that was to happen,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.725 align:middle line:84%
and we would definitely get
our hands slapped for that.

00:23:06.725 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What would you say to
somebody who would say to you,

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Emery, I woke up last night, and
in my room was this being that

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:90%
just appeared and disappeared.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell them?

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Welcome to my world.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I would ask them--

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if they had--

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
this has happened to me,
where friends and family

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and colleagues have
called me and don't

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:90%
want to talk about it.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Especially for a first-time
person to see something like

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
you think you're ready
for it, and a lot

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
of our CE-5 expeditions,
we bring a lot

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:90%
of, sometimes, media with us.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because you
think you're ready for it,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
but when you actually see it, it
doesn't fit into your reality.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's there, and you know
it's there, and you feel it.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I would tell that person,
well, what happened?

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Did it try to communicate?

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Did you try to communicate?

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
What was the events that
happened the night before?

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Were you meditating, or did
you have a close encounter

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth kind?

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:90%
What's been going on?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'd be more interviewing
them and trying

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
to find out why this being chose
this person to expose itself

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to, because there's a
lot of risk for an ET

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:90%
to expose itself.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What is the fifth
kind that you mentioned?

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: A close encounter
of the fifth kind is when you

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
reach out and try to communicate
with extraterrestrials.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
The government doesn't want
you to do this, because--

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.580 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
an FBI file on me,

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.870 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, because I'm
contacting extraterrestrials

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:90%
and talking to them.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's so sad, because
what gives anyone the right?

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.240 align:middle line:90%
And I figured it out.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a backup plan for the
United States government

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:90%
to fake an alien invasion--

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.817 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial invasion--

00:24:53.817 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Which is
Project Blue Beam?

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I don't know
what the pop culture terms are

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I just know for a fact, 100%,
because my FBI people told

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:84%
me this, my CIA
people told me this

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:84%
to warn me-- that they're making
a file of people like you,

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and when this
happens, you're going

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
to be incarcerated, because the
story is you brought them here.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
be a fake invasion.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard this
conspiracy theory before.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's sad to know
that after all I've done,

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:90%
my name is actually on there--

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:90%
on an FBI file--

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.330 align:middle line:84%
saying we got to watch
this guy, make sure

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:84%
he's not talking too much with
them, but also documenting it.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So if they want to pull
that card, they can.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And no one was
even going to know.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
All the people that are involved
with these types of things are

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:90%
aware of this, that do CE-5's.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's a sad thing to
know that I'm a backup plan,

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.631 align:middle line:90%
I'm a terrorist.

00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:84%
They label me as a
terrorist because I'm--

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: They
treat you as such.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.495 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
nothing's happened yet,

00:26:07.495 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that there's
a big file on this--

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:90%
it is worrisome.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's ridiculous.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It's another one of these let's
have the support of the nation

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to fight this terrorist here who
brought these evil aliens here

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.704 align:middle line:90%
to destroy us.

00:26:26.704 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You've been
through a lot of stuff.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: If you were to
write an autobiography about

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
your life, how would
that last chapter end?

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I would finish the
book by giving my own opinion

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
of what the future's
going to look like for us.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Our lives are getting easier.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:90%
We're living longer.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.107 align:middle line:84%
Very positive things are
happening on the planet.

00:26:51.107 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: You're really upbeat.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I love it!

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm so thankful to
be here at this time

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and make a difference,
because I just see the future,

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's so grandiose,
if we could just

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.920 align:middle line:90%
get our act together.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the cities
are going to improve,

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.114 align:middle line:84%
the pollution's
going to go away.

00:27:10.114 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be able
to clean up this place,

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's just going to be the
most magnificent place in all

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.144 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

>> SMITH: They will get bodies,
and they will test the proteins

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA, and they will try
to find cures and things from

agreement with the Draco to get

out of their moon base lease.

busted-up ET craft up there,

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:90%
because we blew them up.
