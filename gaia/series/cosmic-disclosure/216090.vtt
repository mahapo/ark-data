00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY ANDERSON: Just the
energy in the room when I walked

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.670 align:middle line:90%
in it was uncomfortable.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.232 align:middle line:84%
Very ominous feeling,
sense of like something bad

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:20.065 align:middle line:90%
was about to happen.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.610 align:middle line:84%
As I looked at it, the
objects above the podium

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:90%
was metallic sphere.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was hovering
above the podium.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:90%
It looked strange.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Why am I seeing this?

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.875 align:middle line:90%
What is this about?

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:34.675 align:middle line:90%
Am I being tested?

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH GOLEMBESKE: Did
they mention anything about

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:90%
the object to you?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.797 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, this is from
the craft that they've had since

00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%
1940s.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And that it was some kind
of control mechanism.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I noticed there was another
object the next section over.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.378 align:middle line:84%
And it was sitting
on a black table.

00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Was there any
more detail to that?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Like a
rectangular metal object.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:84%
As I'm looking at
it, I could see

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.620 align:middle line:84%
symbols start to appear above
where that LCD screen was.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
A hieroglyphic lettering,
but the strange thing

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:84%
about the letters
were they were--

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Under hypnosis, you
thought that you were receiving

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:90%
a message.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.268 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:12.685 align:middle line:84%
Does that unlock
anything for you?

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:15.185 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: I mean, it was
such a strange thing to witness.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:10%
>> JOSH: What if the most
advanced technologies on Earth

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:10%
aren't just hidden,
they aren't even human?

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:10%
Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we hypnotically regress.

Randy Anderson, a
former Green Beret

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:10%
with access to some
of the military's most

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:10%
restricted sites--

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:10%
including area 51 and Crane--

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:10%
to uncover missing time and
strange symbols buried deep

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:10%
within his memory.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske, MUFON field
investigator and your guest host

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Randi, welcome to the show.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Thanks, Josh.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you are a new
whistleblower breaking

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
into the space and your new
guest on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's let the audience learn a
little bit about your background

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:90%
before we get too deep.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, sure thing.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a 20 year fireman
for the city of Las Vegas.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:90%
I joined the military after--

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.257 align:middle line:90%
a little while after 9/11.

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do
something more to serve

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
my country and my community
as well so I ended up

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:90%
becoming a Green Beret.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the path I
decided to take.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.285 align:middle line:84%
And did that for about 12 years
total military service time.

00:02:18.285 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So how did your
military experience connect

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.275 align:middle line:90%
to these classified programs?

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: It
was just a random--

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
seemed like, at
the time at least,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:84%
a random event that happened and
right place at the right time.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I got involved into a
training program that ended up

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
allowing us access,
me and one other guy,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.075 align:middle line:90%
access to a specific facility.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, where were
you and what happened?

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:10%
>> ANDERSON: So there's a
training course in Crane,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:10%
Indiana, the place
you mentioned.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:10%
And what we do there is go over
a lot of the SOCOM type weapon

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:10%
systems that we use,
a lot of the handguns

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:10%
and rifles and the SCAR,
different types of weapon

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:10%
systems.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:84%
During that class, there was
me and another Green Beret

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:90%
in that course.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Most of the guys in that course
are typically your armors

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
for your teams or armors
for special ops units.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.575 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while, a guy
like me, a weapons specialist,

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:84%
will get to go through
that course just

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
to get an extra
level of training.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
There's also a lot of foreign
weapons technology that's

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:90%
at Crane.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking a
little bit about that,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and we were learning a little
bit about some foreign weapons

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And they asked us
to stay after class,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
if we could hang out after, and
we did, me and the other Green

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Beret.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.275 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Is there any particular
reason why they chose you?

00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Well, I don't
know what the reason would be.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I think they were trying to see
how we react to the technology

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that they showed us, but
that's just an estimate.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I still to this day don't know
why they took us under there.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What did
you see down there?

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Take me through it step by step.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.378 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
that was odd was

00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
they took us into an
elevator, and we went down

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.010 align:middle line:84%
for a significant
amount of floors, which

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't calculate how many.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like we were
going down for a bit,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:90%
longer than normal.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Once we got on the ground,
we exited into a hallway.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was just-- the
whole thing felt strange

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.422 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning.

00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I was a brand new
Green Beret at the time

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
so I wasn't going to
ask a lot of questions

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.275 align:middle line:90%
or say anything, really.

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I was just following
orders and--

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.765 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: It was already unusual.

00:04:11.765 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: It was
already unusual, yeah.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.038 align:middle line:84%
Me and the other guy were
looking at each other

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and just wondering
what was going on.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.142 align:middle line:84%
And the two guys that brought
us underground to this facility

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
were guys that were
private contractors--

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:90%
I found out later--

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
they were private contractors
that worked there,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.517 align:middle line:84%
but they're not part
of Crane specifically.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't part
of our training cadre.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:90%
So they were separate.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And they'd come to the class
after to link up with us

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and bring us down there.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But, anyway, as we
got under there,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
we went through a pretty
significant security checkpoint.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
next really odd thing

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
is I equate it to going
into a SCIF, which

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
the level of security is
pretty high because you're

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
going into a
facility where you're

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
going to be working with
highly sensitive material

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
anything coming in or out.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So it was that type
of level of security.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Went through a checkpoint, got--

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:84%
took off all our electronics--
we call it sanitizing yourself,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
take off all your electronics or
jewelry or anything that could

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:90%
be used to carry information.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
It gets left in a
lockbox and secured.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we went into the
next part of the facility.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:90%
That was a foreign weapons area.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:90%
That was a typical armorer cage.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
They brought us into a
warehouse style room,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:90%
like a small warehouse.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And inside there they had
some foreign weapons tech

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:90%
that we got to look at.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And they asked us
a couple questions

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and showed us a
couple things there.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, we walked
down to the next part

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:90%
of the facility.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned that we're
going to observe something

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:90%
a little more significant.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember exactly
how they worded it,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.455 align:middle line:84%
but the mood kind of shifted
a little more serious.

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.435 align:middle line:90%
So what happened next?

00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: We went through
another security checkpoint,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and that was very odd because we
already went through this a high

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:90%
level security checkpoint.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And then went into
another hallway

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and walked up to a room that had
a placard on the wall and said,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.565 align:middle line:90%
Off World Technology.

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.092 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Off World
Technology Division,

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:90%
which was a weird thing.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
That was something
that stood out to me.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not only
that it said that,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
but then there was a placard
on the wall that said that.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
things that made

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:84%
me think we were
being messed with

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
or that we were being
evaluated for something.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So the room was probably
about maybe 30 feet long,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:90%
maybe 20 feet wide.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
cubicles that were facing

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
towards us as we entered.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that first cubicle,
there was an object and a podium

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:90%
below it.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at it, the
object above the podium

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:90%
was a sphere, a metallic sphere.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was hovering
above the podium.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:90%
It was under it.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was
nothing in contact--

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
no contact between
those two things.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.737 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
thing that I noticed.

00:06:48.737 --> 00:06:51.165 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So just a
pure metallic sphere.

00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:51.965 align:middle line:90%
Roughly how big?

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:53.185 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: About the
size of a basketball.

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Was there anything else
about it or was it just pure

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.855 align:middle line:90%
silver?

00:06:55.855 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: It's
hard to describe.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.182 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing,
it's hard to describe

00:06:59.182 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
because I've never seen anything
like it before or since.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way I can
best describe it is it

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:11.752 align:middle line:84%
looked like a very pearlescent
type of look to the metal.

00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way I
can try to describe it.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.965 align:middle line:90%
It looked strange.

00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: You immediately, when
you looked at it, you were like,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
this is--

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah,
this is not human.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.433 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you could
look at that object

00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:21.823 align:middle line:90%
and not think it's strange.

00:07:21.823 --> 00:07:24.115 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Did they say anything
about the sphere to you?

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, we
talked a little bit.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, this was
the strange things

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
about this were how this was
very nonchalant for these two

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:90%
guys.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking about
it very matter of factly.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I never seen anything
like this. so I was--

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.848 align:middle line:84%
my whole-- everything in my
mind was just tripping out.

00:07:41.848 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So you had no previous
knowledge of UAPs or metallic

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:90%
spheres or anything like that?

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Never been
exposed to anything like that.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.672 align:middle line:84%
Never cared about
anything like that.

00:07:48.672 --> 00:07:49.553 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow, OK.

00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:52.095 align:middle line:84%
So how was your buddy reacting
to it that was there with you?

00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: We're
trained Green Berets.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:84%
We both acted very stoic
and cool about it, I mean,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:90%
but inside I was tripping out.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: I bet.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Freaking
out a little bit.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.465 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: I bet.

00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:02.775 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: And wondering
also, why am I being--

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:90%
why am I seeing this?

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:90%
What is this about?

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Am I being tested?

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I think at the
time what I was mostly

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
thinking was going on is
they were evaluating us

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
for something else, which is not
uncommon in special operations.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
There are other units that
screened for people out of Green

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Berets, Seals, Rangers.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So the way you get to
some of those higher units

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.163 align:middle line:84%
is they'll come through
and look for guys.

00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:27.205 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So they're testing
to see how you react.

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Potentially I
thought maybe it was something

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe to see if we can handle
something extreme or weird.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So I just assumed it was
probably something like that.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.247 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Do you
remember what they said?

00:08:37.247 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: When we first went
into the room and the initial

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
shock of seeing that
object had passed,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking about
it and the guy had asked

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:90%
the question.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear what he asked.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, yeah,
this is from the craft.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.505 align:middle line:84%
And then they've
had it since 1940s.

00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:53.305 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really?

00:08:53.305 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: This is
what he mentioned.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And that it was some kind
of control mechanism.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.357 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Was there anything
else about the sphere you want

00:08:59.357 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:90%
to mention in that moment?

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, it was just
the energy of the room when I

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.650 align:middle line:90%
walked in it was uncomfortable.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had the
feeling like something bad

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.285 align:middle line:90%
was about to happen?

00:09:09.285 --> 00:09:09.705 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:09:09.705 --> 00:09:12.288 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Like in that eerie
feeling like something's going

00:09:12.288 --> 00:09:14.327 align:middle line:90%
to happen and then it does?

00:09:14.327 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:90%
I would equate it to that.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I had a very ominous feeling,
a sense of something bad

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:90%
was about to happen.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Nothing ever
happened, but it just

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:90%
was an intense feeling of that.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.855 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Can you please describe
what else you saw in the room?

00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:26.522 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: So we
walked down a little.

00:09:26.522 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
They started
walking ahead of us,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.892 align:middle line:84%
and we followed them
down a little further.

00:09:29.892 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed there was another
object in the next section over.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.255 align:middle line:84%
And it was sitting on a
black table about three foot

00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:38.055 align:middle line:90%
off the ground.

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:39.325 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: And what was it?

00:09:39.325 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Just a
rectangular metal object.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What about it made it
seem anomalous or different,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:90%
or made you think--

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: It was just
an odd looking object.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It was just oddly
shaped, oddly looking.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
And the way the corners were--

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
difficult to describe.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm pulling on a memory
from a while ago,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
but it did have an
opening at the far,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
as my viewpoint, the right side
of the object had an opening.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a place
you would reach in

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
to grab something or
pick it up is how I'm

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:90%
best describe how it looked.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And then on top
of the object, it

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:84%
had some type of I thought at
the time was like an LCD screen

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:90%
or something on it.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And I just noticed because
we were-- our vantage

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
point was above it and so I had
kind of a top down angle of it.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the front of it
tapered down into a corner.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.852 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:10:32.852 --> 00:10:34.935 align:middle line:84%
Did they mention anything
about the object to you?

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: They talked
a little bit about it.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Again, he was talking to
the other guy about it,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:84%
which seemed almost
set up, as a way

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to give us-- to give out--
to put out the information.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
what it felt like.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.152 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: But he was talking
to him about it and said that

00:10:50.152 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
this was something that was
recovered from the same craft,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and that it was something
that had discharged energy

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.818 align:middle line:84%
and injured somebody at the
time when they recovered it.

00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:00.735 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And is there
any more detail to that?

00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: No.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I remember him talking about
it because the guy said,

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.838 align:middle line:90%
wasn't somebody hurt?

00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said somebody
was injured or killed.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
were injured or killed,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
but somebody was affected by the
energy that discharged off it

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
when they tried to
remove it from the site.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.785 align:middle line:84%
That's when I noticed sort of
looked like heat waves coming

00:11:19.785 --> 00:11:20.585 align:middle line:90%
off the object.

00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.697 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: You know how when
you look through binoculars

00:11:23.697 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and you see you're looking
at terrain and you can see

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
the waves of heat
coming off the ground?

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It sort of started to look
like that above the object.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:34.918 align:middle line:84%
And I focused in on it, and
I looked at my fellow Green

00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Beret and the other
guys in the room,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.668 align:middle line:84%
and they were still talking--
the two guys were still

00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:90%
talking about the object.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.357 align:middle line:84%
And the guy I was with was just
looking at the object like me,

00:11:43.357 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and didn't appear that he
noticed anything about it odd.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that and thought,
is there a heating mechanism

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:90%
or something going on with it?

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm looking
at it, I could

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.340 align:middle line:84%
see symbols start to appear
above where that LCD screen was.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Symbols?

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yes, like
hieroglyphic lettering.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But the strange thing
about the letters,

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
they were real crisp,
almost inky black.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Almost like a dark
ink, but very crisp.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
You can make out what
they were very clear.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.995 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing I'd ever
seen, no symbols I'd never

00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:14.795 align:middle line:90%
seen before that.

00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So from what I
understand, these symbols,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
you've done some
sketches of them.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Can you show us those sketches?

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk us through it?

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, sure.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So I recall the best
I could from memory.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd say the first
several of the ones

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:84%
that I remember the
clearest and then tried

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
to get as much as
I could with it.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
These are as close as I can
pull from memory what I saw.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
What was odd about
them is how they were--

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:90%
the symbols weren't solid.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
They were shifting
between these symbols.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So there was probably about,
I would say, six or seven

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:90%
in a row.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were
transitioning between--

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
they would just phase in
and out at different times,

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:90%
like alternating.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:84%
They had asked us
again what we thought,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:90%
if we noticed anything odd.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And everything
about this was odd,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.383 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't mention
to them that I

00:13:02.383 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:90%
saw the symbols at the time.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really?

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
You were playing
stoic, like you thought

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.585 align:middle line:84%
it was a test so you weren't
going to give them anything.

00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Well, that and I
was also wondering if anybody--

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
if nobody else was seeing it,
maybe I shouldn't say anything.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
It definitely felt
as if the device

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:90%
was communicating in some way.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.157 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: To you or
just in general?

00:13:20.157 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Not consciously,
but it was almost like it was

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:90%
displaying that--

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:84%
from my vantage point, it was
displayed perfectly for me

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.045 align:middle line:90%
to see.

00:13:28.045 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And your partner
who was down there with you,

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.697 align:middle line:84%
they never mentioned
the symbols at all?

00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Nobody else-- from
what I can gather from my time

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.425 align:middle line:84%
in that room is nobody else
seen what I saw off that object.

00:13:38.425 --> 00:13:39.295 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What do
you make of that?

00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:40.378 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: I don't know.

00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I assumed at the
time that I would--

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd get a debrief about it or
we'd do something more with this

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'd get answers
to that at some point,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and I never got
anything else from that.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But I also didn't tell
anybody that I seen it so they

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
didn't-- if they were evaluating
us to see if we had a reaction

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.862 align:middle line:90%
to the technology, I did.

00:13:59.862 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I had a reaction
to the technology.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't tell them that.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Another strange thing
about this incident for me

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:90%
is I have a very good recall.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:90%
I was also a sniper.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
My memory about incidents
is very clear to me

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
all the way back from
my time in the service.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
This particular
incident, strangely,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult
for me to recall.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I really have to dig and think
hard to get simple details back.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.637 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Do you think that
something happened to you

00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:27.437 align:middle line:90%
afterwards?

00:14:27.437 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Were they purposely
repressed that memory,

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
or do you think it was because
of something about the room

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.747 align:middle line:90%
and the situation did it to you?

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: I'm not sure.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to try maybe hypnosis
to see if there is a way

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:90%
to figure some of that Out.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Randy, you were
hypnotically regressed by Sarah

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Breshman Cosme.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.527 align:middle line:90%
How did that go for you?

00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: It was interesting.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's parts of it I
don't remember, but most of it

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I think I remember.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:10%
>> SARAH BRESHMAN COSME:
And as you exhale,

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:10%
just release any tension,
any worries, any thoughts.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:10%
Can I please speak directly with
your higher self now, please?

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.502 align:middle line:84%
Can I speak directly
with your higher self?

00:15:06.502 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: At one point
during the regression,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Sarah started communicating with
your higher self to try to pull

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.468 align:middle line:84%
out more information
about these symbols.

00:15:15.468 --> 00:15:16.635 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember any of that?

00:15:16.635 --> 00:15:17.435 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: No.

00:15:17.435 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, let's take a look.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.495 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: Can you tell me
more about these symbols?

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.441 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me the meaning
behind these symbols?

00:15:29.441 --> 00:15:31.125 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: It's a language.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: Where does
this language come from?

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Orion.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:45.076 align:middle line:84%
There is a connection
for him there.

00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a family type
connection, my history.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's part of where he's from.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Spent many lifetimes in that
area as with the Orion group.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.772 align:middle line:90%
He's fighting in a galactic war.

00:16:07.772 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>> COSME: Tell me about that.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Orion is
another star system.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:84%
They're conquering
that region of space

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and he's a warrior
for that group.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.905 align:middle line:84%
His DNA was causing a
reaction with the device.

00:16:19.905 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>> COSME: How does that work?

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.495 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: DNA encodes
all of your lifetimes.

00:16:25.495 --> 00:16:26.295 align:middle line:90%
It's a record.

00:16:26.295 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The technology was
reacting with his DNA.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:90%
It recognized that he was there.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:45.886 align:middle line:84%
The device was just powering
on, a type of defense weapon.

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:48.375 align:middle line:84%
A sort of protection for
the craft and the crew.

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We call it like an
electromagnetic pulse type

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:90%
of output, high energy output.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The operator can integrate with
this, an AI type technology,

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:90%
but much more advanced.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Just connecting
to you consciously

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.375 align:middle line:90%
and you can control the output.

00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:17.609 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: And so how did they
get that technology in that

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:90%
underground base?

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: It was from a
retrieval program or something

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:90%
they have.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, a craft
that was brought down

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:90%
from another species apart.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
They have no conflict and
the craft was brought down.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And the military
recovered that craft,

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.505 align:middle line:84%
and that was one of
the items from it.

00:17:43.505 --> 00:17:49.694 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: And could the military
actually use this technology?

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:52.252 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: That's
what they want to do.

00:17:52.252 --> 00:17:54.986 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: Can you tell me
more about the symbols?

00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, this is so--

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:84%
this is a device
was coming online

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and it was displaying this
code, rudimentary code.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:90%
But he was a--

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:84%
again, an operator would know
how to read that of what state

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:90%
the device was in.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a conscious integration.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like a meditative state
and you can control the device.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: And what is
the point of the symbols?

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
What do the symbols mean
exactly when they show up?

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: It's splitting
saying the device is powering

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It was running
through a sequence.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: Do the symbols have
any specific meaning in any way?

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: It's a
language of the Orion group.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.335 align:middle line:84%
It's their-- an
alphabet of theirs.

00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:55.186 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: So it was just
telling him the status of this

00:18:55.186 --> 00:18:55.986 align:middle line:90%
particular--

00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:56.786 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Yes.

00:18:56.786 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> COSME: --instrument.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.675 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Can
we take a second?

00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, absolutely, buddy.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Sorry.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, take a second.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.417 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: This is about me.

00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Do you want to
step off set for a second?

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: I'm shaky.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Take a break, dude.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Take a break.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.255 align:middle line:84%
No, take it longer
than a second.

00:19:08.255 --> 00:19:09.285 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:19:09.285 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: That
was weird, man.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:18.525 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: Was this a
psyop, do you feel?

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.208 align:middle line:84%
Or was this
legitimate experience?

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Combination.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It's real artifacts, and
they were seeing if--

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
they know that there
are people that

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:84%
react to some of the
technology, and they

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:84%
were trying to identify
people that would potentially

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:90%
react with that technology.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
They wanted him to explain
if he had seen anything,

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't say that
he did so that's why.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.885 align:middle line:90%
>> COSME: I see.

00:19:56.885 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: They were trying to
figure out where they could pull

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
people from that
would react with it.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
They were seeing if there was a
common thread of certain types

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.625 align:middle line:90%
of people that reacted to it.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: And can you scan or
look and see if other people

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
have reacted to it and
have shown your reaction?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.222 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:21.222 --> 00:20:23.755 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: And they know that.

00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: So what would have
happened had he shown that he

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
reacted to it and he told them?

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: What could have
happened was what they do

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, they bring him
into a different program.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
That's maybe good, maybe
bad, but that's not

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:90%
what he's here to do anyway.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's good that they didn't.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
There was an effort to
prevent that from happening.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> COSME: What was the effort
that was preventing this?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: To make sure he
didn't say that he saw anything

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.972 align:middle line:84%
is probably why he
felt so uncomfortable.

00:21:00.972 --> 00:21:04.354 align:middle line:90%
>> COSME: Thank you.

00:21:04.354 --> 00:21:06.083 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Randy,
just to be clear,

00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:07.375 align:middle line:90%
you don't remember any of that?

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: No.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Let's just
start with you.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.215 align:middle line:90%
Like, what happened to you?

00:21:10.215 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:84%
What triggered you to have
to step away for a second?

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.545 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: I just
don't remember that part.

00:21:14.545 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember most
of it pretty, clear

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:90%
what I thought was most of it.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Just that part I don't
remember it's weird to watch.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Is it more about not
remembering or is it more about

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:90%
what you said?

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.467 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: That too, both.

00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:30.209 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.209 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:90%
It's weird to watch, man.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to watch.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Let's just start with
one of the more interesting

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that you had DNA
connected to the Orion star

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.942 align:middle line:84%
system, or the Orion
people, or an ET race.

00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Does that resonate
with you at all,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
or is that something
at all that you've

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:90%
thought about in the past or?

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: I never
thought about it.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:51.015 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what that means.

00:21:51.015 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: You also mentioned
that the device activated

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
because of you, tied to
your DNA, which makes sense.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.798 align:middle line:84%
So if you were the only person
who saw it, that kind of lines

00:22:01.798 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:90%
up, you know what I mean?

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned you're the
only one who could see it,

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and then now your
higher self is saying

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that your DNA is
from the Orion system

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and this device may have been
activated because of your DNA.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's why you
were brought in that room maybe?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: I guess.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe they were trying
to see who had a reaction to it,

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know--

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.130 align:middle line:84%
personally know
anything about how

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that would work or have never
been exposed to anything

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:90%
like this, so I'm not sure.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: The other thing she
mentioned was a past life,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:90%
which was fascinating.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.460 align:middle line:84%
A previous lifetime in
the Orion belt that where

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:90%
you were a warrior.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's
safe to say you're

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.622 align:middle line:90%
a warrior in this lifetime.

00:22:41.622 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:90%
What would you think of that?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: That's crazy, man.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.260 align:middle line:90%
It's out there, I don't know.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Have you ever had
to talked about the concept

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.707 align:middle line:84%
or studied reincarnation
or any of those?

00:22:49.707 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: No, no.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So that
was just new to you.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:84%
That's not something you
said, that you've ever talked

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:90%
about before with anyone?

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Never.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: One of the other things
you mentioned in that clip was

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the symbols you were seeing
were like a code or the Orion

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.962 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a startup
code, you kind of mentioned,

00:23:03.962 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:90%
for the device.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: As a Green Beret,
we do typically have fluency

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
in multiple languages.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm fluent in
several languages.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.078 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.078 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense
to me that it could

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
be an alphabet of a
language, type of language.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I definitely thought that at
some point when I seen it.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, as you
know I didn't verbalize

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that when we spoke about it,
so that coming out of that's

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
interesting to me because I
do remember thinking that.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: All right.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
You also your higher
self mentioned

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:38.955 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't your destiny.

00:23:38.955 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
You didn't use the word
destiny, but that was

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:90%
not what you're supposed to do.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:90%
How does that make you feel?

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: Did I say purpose?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, your purpose.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.612 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like that
resonates with you?

00:23:48.612 --> 00:23:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, I guess now
but there's a lot to take in.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, I know.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.424 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:23:55.424 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>> ANDERSON: I don't know, man.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.575 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Take your time.

00:23:57.575 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: You gotta
drink that one down.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems like
you have-- you're

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:90%
filled with purpose these days.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.575 align:middle line:84%
You're part of the
Disclosure Movement.

00:24:04.575 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You're coming forward against
odds, you're being courageous.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you were debriefed
and told not to talk about it,

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:90%
but you're doing it anyways.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:84%
It seems like you're
living a life of purpose.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It seems like your higher
self had a different--

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
or you had a different plan
for yourself and you were

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.765 align:middle line:90%
supposed to dodge that.

00:24:17.765 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, I think
I had said something about--

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.288 align:middle line:90%
whatever higher self said.

00:24:27.288 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I forget how it was
said, said that that's

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:90%
why I felt so uncomfortable.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And I really felt uncomfortable.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping to get
out of the regression

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
some of the key details that I
have a hard time remembering,

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.502 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect all that.

00:24:42.502 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Where do you think
this leads for you and humanity

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:90%
in general?

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Well, I think
the important part of just

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
the little piece of the story
that's mine is that they

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
potentially had off world
technology since the 1940s,

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:84%
at least from what I was
told about this incident,

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and that the government
has known about that.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And that sometimes people like
me are exposed to this stuff,

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and there's more
of us out there.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I think as we move
forward with all this

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that's going on now,
hopefully, the truth

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.440 align:middle line:84%
comes out and more
people like me

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:84%
are vindicated for what we're
talking about and the risk we're

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:90%
taking to do so.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.255 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How do you think it's
going to impact the world?

00:25:24.255 --> 00:25:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Hopefully
in a positive way.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to realize
we're not alone is--

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.035 align:middle line:84%
kind of should change the
way we look at ourselves.

00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What are
you going to do next?

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I imagine you're
still on mission

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.055 align:middle line:84%
to help disclose this
information, what

00:25:37.055 --> 00:25:37.855 align:middle line:90%
are your plans?

00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ANDERSON: Yeah, just possibly
getting more involved with

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
