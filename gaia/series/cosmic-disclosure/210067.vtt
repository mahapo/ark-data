00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're with Duane Ollinger,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:10%
a high risk oil contractor
who discovered a system

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:10%
of underground caverns that
run beneath his 160-acre ranch

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:10%
in Utah, home to some
highly unusual anomalies.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on this planet.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having us.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people suggest that
UAPs seem to pass through like

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
vortexes and portals
and stargate.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
What was your experience
on your property with this?

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I just know what Jeremiah
talked about on that whole deal

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:10%
as far as how they used to go
from light years away and how

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:10%
it all worked.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:84%
They always talk
like it takes longer

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to get into a portal
and out of a portal.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:84%
It takes longer to do
that than it does just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
to go from several
light years away.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he explain that
and how that happens?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What he said was they
just have high-level advanced

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:90%
computers.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
In saying that, the
portals are always

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
moving plus or
minus or something.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But those computers
can chase it down,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and they know how
to get into them.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And he always talked that it's
nothing to go several light

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
years away, but it
just takes longer

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:90%
to get in and out of them.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:90%
And I never got to see that.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that's
what he always told me.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it appears that
ETs, as people describe,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:90%
just appear out of nowhere.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And is that an
inter-dimensional thing

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:90%
that you could talk about?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Are they coming through a
portal and then it's there?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Or are they cloaking themselves?

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's something
I don't know about.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I just know that the craft,
that's how they traveled,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.950 align:middle line:84%
was through craft like
a material object.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
He did talk about that they
travel so fast that you have

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to watch your diet because
if you're a meat eater,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
then they got to
slow everything down,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.545 align:middle line:84%
or it'll kill the person that's
in it travelling that fast.

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Death.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You have death in your gut,
and they were all vegetarians,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%
and they love food.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
could travel so fast

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.535 align:middle line:84%
and/or teleport into
different areas.

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> What did you see when you
first experienced those nine

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:90%
UAPs?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Was there like a portal or
something opening or a light?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Or did they just appear?

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So they came in like
they would like an aircraft.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they came in
like you could see them.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, we did not see them on
the back side of the mountain,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
but they were like
they pulled in.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:90%
They just didn't appear.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
They pulled up and stopped,
pulled up and stop, pulled up

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and stopped.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:90%
So they wasn't coming out of a--

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
if they did, it was
something I didn't see.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.755 align:middle line:90%
They came in like a hover.

00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they hovering
the whole time?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Or did it land?

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:90%
On the ground?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.785 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, they
hovered the whole time.

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were exactly
straight across.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:84%
There was 3, 3, and 3,
and they were all in line

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the Northeast.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever seen on your
property vortexes or stargates

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:90%
or anything like this?

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.615 align:middle line:84%
>> So we talked to
the Ute tribal people.

00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And they will tell
you some wild stories

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.140 align:middle line:84%
about things that take
place and how they know.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
We have some markings on
that property out there

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:90%
that they classify as a door.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But in saying that,
it's really not a door

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
like what you would think.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a marker.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.115 align:middle line:84%
And one of the guys
told us you just

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
need to know that
we have to have

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:90%
markers in different areas.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So we know where
the teleport is.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's just a
rock, but it's telling them,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get this
close to be able to--

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it have inscriptions
on it or hieroglyphics--

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>> --petroglyphs?

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Not there right there.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We just have one that
we know of there,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's what one of the
major guys for the Ute nations

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:90%
was telling us.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you general ever talk
about where those portals go

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%
or those vortexes?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it a special one?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
It just goes one place or can
you program it to go wherever?

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> He just always talked
about going from one place

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you got
to stop somewhere and jump

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:90%
on another one.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we ever
really talked about that.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
He did talk about how
their crafts move.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
The craft they-- it's
anti-gravity type situation.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.785 align:middle line:84%
And how he would try to
explain it to me was it would--

00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
they would send out a void or a
vacuum in front of that craft.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they would chase that
vacuum with no restriction.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have a different
anti-gravity on the outer shell

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
as you do on the inner shell, or
you'll just go splat because--

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Create your own field,
your own density

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
field around the vehicle, so
you're not affected by that.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
He said that they
even, on their craft,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
have to put a little
bit of a gravity to it

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:90%
or it seems like a video game.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they lack a
little bit of drag

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:90%
inside so they can feel it.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And they monitor, they drive
those things with helmets,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:90%
with thought.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was told.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And each and every person has
its own helmet or thought.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness
assisted technology.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>> You've heard about this, Tim?

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they reconstructed,
what they found--

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.145 align:middle line:84%
re-engineered those UAPs or UFOs
that they found, for example,

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
in the, well--

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
1947, for example, they
found out by the time

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:84%
that the human body needs
something to relate to,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:84%
so they built in some kind of
feedback mechanism in order--

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
so when the craft goes left that
you feel it with your own body.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not as much that you get--

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:90%
turn to one side or something.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's just enough to get a
feedback so you can control it.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably exactly
what you're describing.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the general ever
talk about maps of these

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.420 align:middle line:84%
interstellar highways
through portals or anything?

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Just that there's computers
that can latch on to them

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and find them.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So he never really talked
about a map system or anything

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.465 align:middle line:84%
like that, but they'd have to
have something I would think.

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the general insinuating
that the vortexes and star

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:90%
gates are found by the AI?

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something that they
already know where this goes?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they know
where they're kinda close,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
but they still have to
move around to get in them.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they naturally formed?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Or are they creating
these portals?

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they're
naturally formed,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
is what I understood
out of that whole deal.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And they have the computer
system to find them.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.515 align:middle line:84%
But they always move a little
bit, and that's the problem.

00:07:41.515 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> A little bit meaning a couple
of meters or kilometers or--

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> That's just what he said, was
they always move a little bit.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the computer
system has to find it

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:90%
because they're moving on them.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he ever mention about
entering suns as the sun

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.616 align:middle line:84%
as the energy source to go
through a portal or a vortex?

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Not necessarily that, but he
talked about that these planets

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
like the moon and Mars and all
that on the back side it's just

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
full of life, lots
of folks up there.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:84%
He said it's nowhere
close to what we think.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he define what kind of
people are living on the moon

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:90%
or on Mars, for example?

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> He talked about on the
moon they were having--

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
where the federation
had to step in

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
because they were
having a little war up

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:90%
there because the--

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:90%
oh, wow.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Let me think here.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
The reptilians were pissed
because somebody was moving in

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:90%
on their territory.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
to step in and set

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
some guidelines, another
entity of some kind, but--

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> He didn't mention
what that entity was?

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
He did mention about
the reptilians up there.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But he did not say what
other one it was as far as--

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.095 align:middle line:84%
>> What did he say about
the reptilians up there?

00:08:59.095 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So he did say that
the reptilians were mad

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
because they have been
there for a lot longer.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And they felt like
it was their--

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Territory.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> --territory.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they hostile?

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Or are they friendly?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> He never really mentioned
too much about that.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
They just said that they
had to step in and put

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:90%
some guidelines in--

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> What about Mars?

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned Mars that
there are living species?

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he talked about that.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> What did he say?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> He just talked like
there was, I mean,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.575 align:middle line:84%
to what extent or
anything like that.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But that was nothing
for them to go there.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he ever mention what
the majority race is on either

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.585 align:middle line:90%
in Mars or the moon?

00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I took it that it was
probably the reptilians

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
on the moon because of
their timeline there.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.102 align:middle line:84%
But he never really told like
populations or everything.

00:09:59.102 --> 00:10:01.435 align:middle line:84%
He just said, you just need
to know it's very populated.

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.345 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Tim?

00:10:04.345 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree too.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that there's a
specific reptilian race that

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is said to have
claimed a big part

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:90%
of the back side of the moon.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It's also been said to me that
there is a reptile species

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:90%
on planet Mars.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've never been there, but
it's interesting to hear what--

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%
It just, like--

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> --the general sense, right.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --validates stuff that
you and I have been through.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So the one thing that I'm
pretty curious about is you

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:90%
told us that we have--

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that you have eight to nine
years of talks and experiences

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:90%
with the general.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:84%
What did he tell you about the
universe, about other species?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:90%
What did you learn from him?

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, what he did say that
was very interesting is

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:84%
they've only been outside of
their galaxy just a couple

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:90%
of times.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And he says once they
get into another galaxy,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:84%
they don't want no
more-- a part of it.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
They say it's a lot wilder
out there in other galaxies,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
but he never would make
the comment of how wild.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:90%
But they're used to wild.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:22.495 align:middle line:84%
And so you think,
what is wild then if--

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
he just act like that's
not any place you

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:90%
want to go into another galaxy.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the most curious
question you ever asked him?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, goodness gracious.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I do know that he would always
overemphasize the fact that

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Duane, you just
need to know there's

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as
deep dark space.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's only dark on
the backside of the planet.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And I go to thinking
that you draw that out,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and I said, man,
that's a tough one.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:84%
What about the star
deal and all this?

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But he always said it's not
dark headed into the light.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just dark behind
any planetary system.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a program of
misconception that us humans

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
here on the planet have got
programmed, I would say,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
because the entire universe
is all light just like we are.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> He never offered you
to join him on this craft.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So what took place
there is you have

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.105 align:middle line:84%
to get your permissions
and the whole 9 yards.

00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, you just need to know
you're on the list, Duane.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.613 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, sign
me up because I'll go,

00:12:40.613 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
but then I might want
to get kicked back

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:90%
off here or something.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened then?

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>> So it never happened.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:90%
He got sick and then--

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.256 align:middle line:84%
but that's just his
statements about--

00:12:52.256 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.105 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you will ever get
in contact with the Galactic

00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:56.905 align:middle line:90%
Federation again?

00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I don't know.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be afraid of it
if I did because I've seen

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and know how they
think and operate.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you
communicate via phone?

00:13:06.355 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes, on that.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So they always say that
there are a thousand

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:90%
years of advanced technology.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
So they pretty well--

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:84%
people ask me, well, how
they send something to us.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.965 align:middle line:90%
Well, email.

00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Email.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> They can do whatever
they want to do.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:10%
So if you ever listen to Don
Nicoloff, on Evident Footprint,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:10%
he entered-- he interviewed
Jeremiah Davis on the phone.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were-- and I
know that sounds crazy,

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:90%
but I've seen their ships.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a long interview
with Jeremiah Davis and Don

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.812 align:middle line:84%
Nicoloff back in '09,
somewhere around there.

00:13:45.812 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll have to look that up.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's very interesting.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.440 align:middle line:84%
He talks about a lot of this
that we're a warring nation,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.155 align:middle line:90%
that we're a warring world.

00:13:54.155 --> 00:13:58.055 align:middle line:84%
And we got to get that out of
our system before we can be--

00:13:58.055 --> 00:13:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Amongst the stars.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah always talked
about the 20 and back.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I never did quite
understand that,

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:84%
but he always
overemphasized the fact

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
that the 20 and back is real.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.055 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:14:13.055 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is that?

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:84%
What'd he say that
is, what is that?

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's basically they're
gone for 20 years,

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and then they have no memory
of it when they get back.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they still the same
age or they never aged?

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't get
into that as much.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed like
it was probably--

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.040 align:middle line:90%
it sounds wild.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind, him
talking about it

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:90%
that they were the same age.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't
get that one, but he

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
said you got to remember that
20 and back is real, Duane.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so there is a
technology that some ETs are

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:84%
using when they do
these contact scenarios,

00:14:54.170 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
which is basically they create
a phase in time where they put

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
in information and
let that develop.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they delete and
close that time window.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And people wake like 15
minutes later or something,

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
but they have a much
brighter information spectrum

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.020 align:middle line:90%
inside of their mind.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
the same technique

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that's been used for what's
called the 20 and back program,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
where people are being put
through a 20-year of service.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the time frame
gets closed again,

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and they wake up in their
bed 15 minutes later.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard of this, but I do
not have any experience in it.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
You're right down the road
from Skinwalker Ranch.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
three letter agencies

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
out there have claimed about
these portals, stargates,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and vortexes.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.555 align:middle line:84%
Are any of these things
found on your property?

00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So as far as found on our
property, that would be a no.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But to interview all
these people that

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:84%
are in that area that
have seen so many things,

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
it's unreal, like the
skin-walkers and things

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
like that to see in their
eyes and while they're

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.010 align:middle line:90%
being interviewed.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have had to hold
that within their hearts

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.478 align:middle line:90%
since they was 12 years old.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And now they're finally
getting to tell it,

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and they tell it exactly like
somebody else that they don't

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
even know would tell it about
these animals of some kind that

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.245 align:middle line:90%
are just wild looking.

00:16:31.245 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And so in turn, do we know
what happens on our place?

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not out there all the time.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But it sure happens
within that whole area.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You need to explain
that to European.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:90%
What is a skin-walker?

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> This is great.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.985 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's basically--

00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We see different theories
about hybridization and about

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the underground facilities
that may or may not be there,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:84%
portals and extraterrestrial
craft buried there,

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
mutations because of radioactive
material that's down there.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
different, I think,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
theories about what
that possibly is.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's kind of a
mutation or something.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some people think
that it is derived from

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.279 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial genetics.

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:22.875 align:middle line:84%
>> I do know of people that
have seen just exactly what

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big, old
stand-up werewolf looking

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:90%
dog head and things like that.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
What's strange is
we talked to one guy

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that he said but
they can change form.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So they can be a
scary type object

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
or walk around or
go around the rock

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and come out as
a little raccoon.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So none of this
makes sense to me.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, but it's--

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
if you see in their eyes,
they ain't BSing now.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's real.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I've actually stumbled upon
that in New Mexico a few times

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the road
really late at night,

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:84%
about 8 to 10-foot tall werewolf
looking thing and immediately

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:90%
goes into a bunny rabbit.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.222 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, right in
front of my eyes.

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right there
with my friends watching

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a one heck of a spectacle.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And also very frightening
when the first time you see

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:90%
something that large.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.243 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what, I'm
glad I live in Europe.

00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:21.536 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they might
be over there too.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably yes.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any anomalies
on your property that relate

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to vortexes and any type
of phenomena like that?

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.405 align:middle line:84%
>> The only thing that I
can say is we have up on top

00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain, on the side of
the mountain where it'd be hard

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:90%
to get to, there's a door.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's so smooth
on that whole deal.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It's on the real end.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Right around the
corner in that area

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that's where we have a tree
where lightning strikes.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We have pictures of lightning
strikes shooting out

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:84%
like what they saw a long
time ago when Jeremiah

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Davis reported it to us.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But lightning strikes shoot out
of the side of these two rocks,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and we have that on a
little bitty short film.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And then right in
between that is

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
where it's like a plasma smoke,
like it's a dark smoke here,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
dark smoke here, white
smoke in the middle

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that proves the point that
it is a plasma arc coming out

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:90%
there too.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
It just screws with the
equipment, the whole 9 yards,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's awful
strange that that's

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:84%
where the Ute tribal
leader told us

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that's where they have to
make marks where they come in

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:90%
and come and go.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen any
of this, but they

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:90%
talk about the little people.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And they talk
about you just need

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to know in this
area right in here

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
is that's where the
little people come and go.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about how
they change their frequency

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:84%
by diet, where they can come
and go, and they're tricksters.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen it,
but I'm just saying

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:90%
that's what they tell me.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And who are they?

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:90%
The little people?

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, see, that's something
I haven't never seen how little

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.910 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying that's
what the Ute nations or the Ute

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:90%
people talk about.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And they say that that's one
of the spots where they come

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and go right up
in that-- right up

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:90%
in that area of the mountains.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
How that works I
just don't know.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.498 align:middle line:84%
>> You had mentioned the
markings on the rock.

00:20:26.498 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Did you see anything
or feel anything else?

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, where we
drilled those holes when we

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
opened it up for the documentary
when we lifted that board up,

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:84%
it was like there was a big
vortex come out of the ground

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that's been covered up for
over 10 years plus or minus.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And it went up in
the air, and it

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
spun in a counterclockwise
manner, huge wind of-- it

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:90%
was like we were in a tornado.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a vacuum, maybe?

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and there
was a tree about, oh,

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to the Northeast about
200 yards over there.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Basically that tornado
come out of that area where

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:90%
that hole was and it went up.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I knew it was
spinning counterclockwise

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:84%
was there was some
plastic there that we

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
used to cover up
the board, so it

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:84%
didn't rot the boards
and things like that.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So that tornado picked up
the dirt and the plastic

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:90%
and the whole 9 yards.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:84%
There was camera crews
there the whole thing.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was blowing everybody
all over the place.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And it went straight over
to that great, big pine tree

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:90%
to the North, Northeast.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was stopped
at that pine tree,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's like it got in a
fistfight with that pine tree.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And it just stayed right
over the top of it,

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.816 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
[VOCALIZES],, just stopped.

00:21:49.816 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you experience
any physical things,

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:84%
like your ears popping
or any pressure changes?

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>> No, just more so
it was just so windy.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was-- we
were standing there

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
in a huge tornadic-like
situation.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:90%
That came from nowhere.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Did it mess with
any of your equipment?

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the area that it
does mess with the equipment.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, all
they were trying to do

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
was hang on to
their hats and not

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:90%
know what the heck's going on.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think
the significance

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
of the counterclockwise
motion of the tornado is?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We've learned some different
things about counterclockwise

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
in our side of the
hemisphere anyway.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.655 align:middle line:84%
So that's what orgone energy
is, what we were told.

00:22:38.655 --> 00:22:42.775 align:middle line:84%
And so for some reason,
that's just the way

00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:45.955 align:middle line:84%
the energy came out and
then they went right over

00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:47.477 align:middle line:90%
to that tree.

00:22:47.477 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of people
that saw this whole deal.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the
only time we've

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
had something go crazy
like that, just comes out

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:90%
of nowhere.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.525 align:middle line:84%
>> What else have
you experienced?

00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, hit the pond where we'll
be doing some filming down

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
there and all of a sudden just
out of the blue in that pond

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:84%
area it just starts blowing
everything all over the place

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and people falling
around and down.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:90%
And it gets pretty wild.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I just don't know.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
In Texas, we just call
that little twister,

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.665 align:middle line:84%
but that one came
out of the ground.

00:23:23.665 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And you lived in
Texas for quite a while.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen this
phenomena before?

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Where is that originating from?

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.472 align:middle line:84%
And did that twister
go back to the hole?

00:23:34.472 --> 00:23:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So the only thing I've
ever known about tornadoes,

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and we've seen many of them, is
you see them from a long ways

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.550 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're tearing things
up all over the place.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So you get to see
them, but you've never

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
seen one just
created right there.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
But see, that hole had been
covered up for over 10 years.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.755 align:middle line:84%
And the film crew
was there, and they

00:23:53.755 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:84%
were going to open that hole
so we could go down and take

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:90%
more samples of the blue dirt.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we pull that all off
and just put that board over

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:84%
to the side, that's
whenever it just got crazy.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:90%
And then it started right there.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And then that's where
it went right across.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It got into that
big, huge pine tree.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's like that--

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I know this sounds
crazy, but it's

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
like that pine tree just
accepted the energy back

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:90%
into the ground.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.225 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot of
people that don't know,

00:24:26.225 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:84%
because we're all still
scratching their head

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:90%
on that one.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think your vortex
on your property is a beacon

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
for visitation?

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's just
something I don't know.

00:24:35.675 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But we do have equipment that
just doesn't work with a flip

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
there, like they launched drones
in that area and I told them.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, don't launch
those drones right here.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.965 align:middle line:84%
I said they'll mess
your equipment up,

00:24:49.965 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't believe me.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And so they launched one,
and screen went grey.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And it just wrecked that thing
right side of the mountain.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Now you did mention--

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you did mention earlier that
there was a craft underground

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:90%
on your property somewhere.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that the
energy from this craft

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
could be distorting the drone,
the equipment, your health?

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So I was told by
Jeremiah that there

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:84%
is an object about
150 foot down in that

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:90%
what we call the energy zone.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It has to be affecting a lot
of things, I would think.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So far in life, I hadn't
seen anybody that's

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:90%
had their health affected.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like it-- if nothing else,
it maybe charges your body then

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:90%
takes away.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel that when
you're on the property?

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like it's affecting
your health in a positive way?

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, people that go
out there, they've had pains.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lady
from Skinwalker Ranch

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
that had a cataract on one
eye and glaucoma type deal.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:84%
She got in the ponds
over there where

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
it's tied to lay lines,
meteorites, the whole nine

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
yards, plus this blue aura
and the lightning strike.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:84%
She got into the ponds, then
went into the energy zone

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And two hours later, she didn't
have no more eye problems.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:90%
That's her story, not mine.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many people
that talk about the things that

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:90%
have happened to them.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not pushing
them to tell us,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
oh, come on, tell us
something better than that.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we don't care.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's either it did
or it didn't help.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
There's been people
that's had basically neck

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
problems for 12 years that
had these problems at birth.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lady that
fought this problem, where

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't move her neck
and anything like that

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:90%
for the last 12 years.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And she got into the ponds
and then went over there,

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and she talked to
her husband, saying

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:90%
this is really scaring me.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.940 align:middle line:90%
And he asked her why?

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And she said because I
can finally move my neck.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So how large are these ponds?

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>The pond where we go in and
out of the cave systems is

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.458 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.965 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's connected to the
underground water system.

00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> The underground stream also.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where one
of our entry points is.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the blind frogs
come out and the whole 9 yards.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever used any other
technology in order to measure

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.835 align:middle line:84%
anything or any
of those effects?

00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So about the energy
fields or what's taking place

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:90%
of the people, yes, we have.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:84%
There was a lady and a
man that came out there

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:90%
that could measure your body.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they did a
test in Vernal, Utah,

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.020 align:middle line:90%
where they took about 10 people.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.785 align:middle line:84%
And they measured their
body electrical current.

00:27:48.785 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Voltage, right?

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, something like that.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And so in turn what took place
was is they measure you there.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was anywhere
from 50 to 55 to 60.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
They all went out to the
ranch, including me too.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they got in the ponds
and then got out and measured.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And those people all gained
about 20 points plus or minus.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And those people that
run that equipment said,

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:90%
this is unheard of.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It never happens.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it has to be
somewhat of an energy field

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that's helping your cells
charge to repair something.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, positively charges you,
which and it would make sense

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:84%
that being in this pond, raising
your voltage could actually

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:90%
help you.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the general ever
say something to you about

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.845 align:middle line:90%
the plants or the effects?

00:28:36.845 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, not on that.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:84%
He just told us about the
blue aura on the East side,

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be
affecting everything

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:84%
because those pollens are tied
to meteorites and the whole

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:84%
9 yards that the underground
cave system is all a part of.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And we know that by the
satellite technology,

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:90%
what we know.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you take
the water and they

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
get a sample of that
water, then they

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.190 align:middle line:84%
can track those
elements in the water.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where we know
where the cave systems go.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So you don't think
it's in the water.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you take like a
bottle full of the water,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:84%
it would lose its qualities if
you move it away from the pond?

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's a local effect?

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it
can be transported?

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You know it something
I don't know about.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if water loses its
charge once it has it in it.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know those things.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Some water can.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Forced data water plasma
holds pretty well for a very

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
long time, which probably
is-- sounds like the charges.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever experienced
any type of time anomalies

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:90%
on the property or--?

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So for whatever reason, like
if you have a GPS out there,

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.330 align:middle line:90%
it's never going to be right.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:30:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned that lesson,
but even the elevations,

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:04.760 align:middle line:84%
like you can take a
measurement in a certain spot,

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're higher, but
it'll show you lower.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you move around, and
the lower will show you higher.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It just screws up equipment
like you wouldn't believe.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's never, never the same.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.445 align:middle line:84%
There's been people
out there that are--

00:30:19.445 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
this is back in '09,
somewhere around there where

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.765 align:middle line:84%
their watches
would just go nuts.

00:30:25.765 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like an
inter-dimensional,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
transdimensional, time spatial
where that maybe you are in two

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
places at the same time
because maybe the elevation was

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.520 align:middle line:84%
different a thousand years
ago or a million years ago.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up on all
these different elevations.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And well, what we have seen
is there a lot of people that

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:84%
enter, for example,
crop circles,

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:84%
they're changed to their
pigmentation on their color

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.430 align:middle line:90%
on the skin.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Have people ever experienced
some kind of pigmentation

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:90%
changes on their skin?

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> They never got
that technical.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
They just always-- people talk
about how much better they feel

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But to get right down to
some of that other stuff,

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.575 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't know.

00:31:10.575 --> 00:31:11.375 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:11.375 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'm not there on all the
tours and everybody that's been

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.990 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel like you might be
exploring something that's just

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:84%
too much power
for you to handle?

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think at this
time in my life,

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.880 align:middle line:90%
the knowing is worth the risk.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel like you have
a responsibility to share this

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:90%
information to the world?

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I do because if we can
help move humanity forward

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:45.050 align:middle line:84%
in a better way, then, my gosh,
for me to keep a secret from

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
y'all or my
grandkids or my kids,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that would help them make
a better decision later

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.800 align:middle line:84%
on in life if they
know the truth.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's very important.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Duane, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And, Tim, thank
you for joining us.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Emery.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and this is

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:90%
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's so much
complexity to a disclosure

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.880 align:middle line:84%
The government would have
to come out and admit

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that they disinformed
people since 1947

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:90%
probably even before that.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
people don't connect the UAP

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon with is
the disappearance

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:84%
of millions of people
around the Earth every year.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I know we have some
very advanced weapons.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be
used against the country.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It was going to be
used against something

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.583 align:middle line:90%
else, some other entity.

00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And that other entity
is going to be something

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:90%
coming from outer space.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:10%
