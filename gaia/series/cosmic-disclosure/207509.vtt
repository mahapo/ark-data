00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor from Germany
who analyzes and suggests

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:10%
various strategies in relation
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Captain Randy Cramer,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:10%
who claims to be the public
spokesperson for the United

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
States Marine Corps
Special Section.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having us.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Glad to be here.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not very often we
get two people on the set

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, so it's going
to be a very exciting day.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start it off by
talking about the reptilian

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.132 align:middle line:84%
Dracos that you have a lot
of experience with, Randy.

00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, probably, the
first I'd learned about them

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
was just hearing rumors and
scuttlebutts and so forth about

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:84%
them, but my first experience of
them was when I was in the MDF

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
when they actually attempted
a invasion of Mars.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We were basically about to have
a big fight between a group

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:84%
of Terran humans, a group
of indigenous reptoids,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and a group of
indigenous insectoids.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
This drop ship came down, and
it was a whole drama affair.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But that was my first
time experiencing them

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:90%
and seeing them.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.523 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the
audience, the MDF is--

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Mars Defense Force.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> My function is to be more
diplomatic on everything.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So you've been to the
military and still are.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:90%
You are still in the military?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, yeah, still have
active duty rank and security

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%
clearance.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is the
actual relationship, Dracos

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:90%
to human people right now?

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right now, minimal.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I would say we probably
started the eradication

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Draconians
within Terran space

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
in the late '90s or early 2000s,
and from what I understand,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
there's less than
a hundred of them

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the Earth right now.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're being hunted
down, so I consider

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:90%
them to be an old problem.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Most often, when
people want to talk

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.052 align:middle line:84%
about them or their
influence, you're

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
really talking about the
past and not much that

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:90%
is relevant to the future.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that they're
not a problem in the larger

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
universe, because
they're still out there,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
but we have ejected them
from our primary space.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're not nearly
as much of a problem

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
here as they ever
were in the past.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.180 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So to my understanding
and what I've heard is that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
the Dracos are still
active in the universe,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and they still are trying to
bring their system over certain

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:90%
planets.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you agree on that?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
No, I would consider of the
larger intergalactic threats,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they're a
top 10, for sure.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
They're a top 10 intergalactic
threat to anybody anywhere,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:90%
I would have to say, yeah.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, all right.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot about
them from the perspective

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of the Greys.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I also learned from
different sources

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that they oppose some
kind of installation

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
upon Earth, which means they
influence the system that Earth

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:90%
has.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
information on that?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd have to give me some
more details for me to try

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.617 align:middle line:84%
and pin something on that, but
I don't have anything specific,

00:03:25.617 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I think, that I could
answer for that.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Greys accused
them or at least--

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
well, from their
perspective, there

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
had been some modifications
on the social structure

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:90%
system of the Earth.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that
would be over time.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
certain people who

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
have talked about the history
of the Draconians influencing

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:90%
human culture.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I think that--

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.963 align:middle line:90%
>> They go way back.

00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, way back.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The kind of
influence or breeding

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
within the blue bloods
or the royal families,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
that's correct from
what I understand.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So they have had an
influence and certainly

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
a negative social influence
that is, what I would say,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
is away from the intergalactic
norm of moving towards type 1

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
civilization, which they have
pushed to keep us from getting

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:84%
to type 1 civilization,
because that makes

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:90%
the species more controllable.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
But again, yeah, that's the
history of and definitely

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
something that
influenced us over time,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.828 align:middle line:84%
but even though if
they're physically not

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
as much of a problem, yeah,
they left their fingerprint

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the things
we're dealing with in finance,

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
banking, hierarchical
structures,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
military governmental
structures,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
we're still dealing with the
mess that they left, for sure.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> From the perspective of the
Greys who are capable of time

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
travel and moving towards
time temporal dimensions,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
they say the Dracos are
also capable of that,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and they have used that.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, OK.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they certainly
have use time travel

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:90%
to interfere from time to time.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have to take a step and
say temporal mechanics is not

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:90%
my forte.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
However, I've talked to some
smart guys with Time Corps

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
so I hope I understand it
as well as I do sometimes.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is there are
specific windows in the past

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:90%
that are vulnerable points.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't just physically
bring a person or a ship

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:90%
to want to mess with time.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
windows in which

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
you could come to a
very specific point,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and so wherever
there's an entry point,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
someone could come
in and tinker.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's also intergalactic
temporal time lords or whatever

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:90%
you want to call them.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have a fully
established Terran Time Corps,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:90%
time wars became a thing.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think, at
the moment, I don't

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
know if I'm speaking
too soon, but I'd

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:84%
say we have a pretty good
lock on people not messing

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:90%
with the timestream right now.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Fingers crossed,
but it definitely

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:84%
has been a thing in
the past, for sure.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.722 align:middle line:84%
>> I already stated that this
goes at least 15,000 years ago.

00:05:52.722 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, at least, for
sure, yeah, a long time.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have the
same information.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know how long
specifically they've been here,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
but I would say it
goes back, I mean--

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I'd gander it's
closer to 40,000,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
50,000 or maybe
100,000 years ago.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
understand, when you

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
get into certain large
historical numbers,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
you have civilizations
that exist

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
today that do not remember what
happened 400,000 years ago.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So they have some
understanding of that history.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Chronovisors give you a certain
amount of accurate information,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:84%
but there is some
stuff, the farther back

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
you want to look,
the fuzzier it gets.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.613 align:middle line:84%
So chronovisors
really only go back

00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
a certain number of thousands
of years before the image is

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
completely blurry because
the tachyons are too weak

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's some things that
happen a half a million years

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:84%
ago that we kind of think
it happened that way,

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
but unless there was someone
who was old enough to be there,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
there's some archeological,
historical guesswork in all

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you also aware of
the Greys having repaired

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
or influenced the
timelines of humanity?

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we know of no less
than five factions of Zetas

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:84%
or Greys, some of them have
certainly tried to do harmful

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Some have certainly maybe
tried to do helpful things.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, they're not my
most experted area,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
but again, because there's
five different factions, yeah--

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:90%
who's doing good things?

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Who's doing bad things?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Someone tells you they're
your friend one day,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you find out they're
not your friend the next day.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's been our
relationship with the Greys

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.055 align:middle line:84%
mostly for the last 50, 60
years, is, oh, you're a friend.

00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh no, wait, now
you're not our friend.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.460 align:middle line:90%
These guys are our friend.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.793 align:middle line:90%
Oh wait, they're not our friend.

00:07:28.793 --> 00:07:30.567 align:middle line:90%
So they're very self-serving.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's just be honest about that.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
They're very
self-serving, so it's

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
hard to get them to have
what we consider keeping

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:90%
your word in an agreement.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
They keep agreements
based on practicality

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
more than anything, but
we kind of like to think,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:90%
I gave my word.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to keep
my word on that.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
give a crap about that.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you agree
with that, Tim?

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> About the contracts and
the different relationships,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I agree with Randy in 100%
of what he told already.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's super interesting
for me to explore that side,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
especially because Randy has
this background of militaries.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm more into diplomatic stuff,
and I find this whole scenario

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:84%
a little challenging
because I'm trained

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:90%
in finding exit strategies.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But I know the military
has a more proactive way

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:90%
to get things done.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy just mentioned a
relationship between the blue

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:90%
bloods and the reptilians.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of any of that?

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:84%
From my understanding, at
least some types of reptilians

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
have influenced human
social structures.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Some have done that by
influencing very elite groups

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, and again, not
all reptilians seem to be bad.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
At least, that's my experience.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, don't get me
talking about that.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:90%
That's speciesist talk.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:90%
They are not all bad.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, true.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:90%
All right, OK.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, oh yeah.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So it seems that some
reptilian species tend to have

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
their own advantages over
people on this planet being

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
so disinformed, and they try
to have their own take on that.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
want to add to that.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm actually glad you
really brought that up

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:84%
because in my experience,
there is a tendency

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to run into reptilian
species that

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:90%
may not be so nice or friendly.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But to say that reptilians
are bad, it's speciesism,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of get angry
about it because I've

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
heard a lot of people say,
nope, all reptiles are bad.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's bull pucky.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my personal experience
of spending almost six months

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
with the indigenous
reptoids on Mars

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is they are some of the most
amazing beings in the universe

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that I have ever
met, and they are

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:84%
nothing like any of the
other reptoids that I've met.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And it has a lot to do with
their culture, their evolution,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:84%
what has happened to their
society, what happened when

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
the planet blew out
its atmosphere, how

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:90%
they had to rebuild from that.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
They were incredibly
warlike before that,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and they really had to grow as a
species, to be honest with you,

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to rebuild and
terraform their planet.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a
speciesist statement

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
to say that any mammal,
amphibian, reptoid

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:90%
is like this or like that.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I think the truth is that the
universe is all the things.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
The intergalactic
experiences all the things.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
It's every type of species,
every type of civilization,

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:84%
every type of technology
that you could possibly even

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
imagine, and that's
an incredible spectrum

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
of various species
from various types

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
of evolutionary
developments who are

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
as different as the day is long
you go from one to the other.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I think the tendency
for people to think

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.743 align:middle line:84%
that is because most reptoids
are not very emotional.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
They have little emotions, but
they're not very emotional.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to be
more calculating.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be a
little more cold.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, they
eat just about everything,

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:90%
and so I think--

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we've had this--

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.587 align:middle line:84%
>> --we've had this
conversation before.

00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything's on the menu.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere, you're on the menu.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the menu, and so we
taste good to some of them.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of creates
a negative relationship.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, no, I don't think that
there's any truth to saying,

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
all of this type of
species are good,

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:84%
or all of this type
of species is bad.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
It's as complicated
as any geopolitics

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
we have here on trying
to figure out, well--

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.478 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't want
to peg somebody.

00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Let me see if I can come
up with a random country

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.298 align:middle line:84%
that no one will
pick them before.

00:11:42.298 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll say Brazil
because I love Brazil,

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.798 align:middle line:84%
and I have plenty of
friends from Brazil.

00:11:45.798 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
If you say, all the people
from Brazil are good people,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
or all the people
from Brazil are bad,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
or they're all corrupt,
you can't say that.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can't say that
about any other people,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
any other species,
or any other planet.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's really different.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And you mentioned before to
me that there's multiple types

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:90%
of reptilians.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Dozens that I'm
aware of personally,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but I would say just
within our own galaxy,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
we've got to have thousands and
thousands of civilized species

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:90%
that are reptilian.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>> What you were saying
about speciesism,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
one can then again say that
there are species that have

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:90%
their own agenda.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.445 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, there are agendas
all over the place, right?

00:12:22.445 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think it's OK
to hate on Draconians,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:90%
not OK to hate on reptiles.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Let me be specific about that.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you want to
hate on Dracos, fine.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
They suck, but it's not fair
to hate on reptiles just

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:90%
because they're a reptile.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What, from your perspective
as a military person,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:90%
have the Dracos done to Earth?

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
What are the
systems they set up?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.738 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything specifically?

00:12:47.738 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So the corporate structure--
let's start with that--

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:90%
is a Draconian structure.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Their entire civilization is
actually on a corporate model,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
so they don't necessarily
have a congress

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%
or a senate or a council.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
They have an executive board,
and the executive board

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.930 align:middle line:84%
is all about profits
and profit making.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially,
if we were to look

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
at the corporate
structure and say,

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
wow, this seems a little
psychopathic and sociopathic

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, it's because it's
a Draconian structure, not

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:90%
a structure of our own design.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's also
about secret control.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Always, yeah, always, always
about a tiny number of people

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
controlling everything
that happens below them,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
making a pyramid with a
very tiny, tiny tip-top.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You spoke about some of the
structures here of the Greys.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does that correlate
with some of the structures

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe that Randy was just
talking about with the Dracos?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it is not
a one-way street on Earth.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I think we all agree on that,
that several agendas exist

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, and influences
from all over the universe

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:90%
came to Earth.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I also talked about
at least 12 species

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that have had put influences on
the genetics of human people.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is
something you know about.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I would say that
from what we understand that

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:84%
the number right now of what
we consider to be major genetic

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
progenitors in the past is
somewhere between about 25

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.025 align:middle line:90%
and 28 species.

00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:22.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow.

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> However, however, those that
have tinkered with the genetic

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
system is at least
another hundred species.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to think
about who has just come along

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to tinker and manipulate,
over a hundred

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and at least a
couple of dozen that

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:90%
are major, major progenitors.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And a major
progenitor means they

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't just come and tinker.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:90%
They came here.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:90%
They lived.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:90%
They interbred.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.830 align:middle line:84%
They really added
their DNA to the pool

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:84%
for some amount of time of
centuries or thousands of years

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.315 align:middle line:90%
that they lived here.

00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody asked me, so if
a reptilian has tinkered with

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:84%
the genetics of human people,
why don't we all look like

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:90%
reptilians?

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And I suggested
that there may be

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
parts of genetics that are
put into the genetic code

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
of humans, and also, we have
different parts that have

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.727 align:middle line:90%
been influenced differently.

00:15:09.727 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:84%
What were you going
to say about that?

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're still
sitting here no matter

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
what DNA has been added as far
as extraterrestrial hybridized

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:90%
DNA.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:90%
We're like 99% chimp, right?

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:90%
We're 99% chimpanzee.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't look
like chimpanzees, well,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:90%
because we're not the same.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So you can be 99% like
something and not physically

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:90%
look exactly like it.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So whatever tinkering of
reptilian DNA or codons being

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
turned on and off,
none of that has

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to influence how we physically
appear so that we would appear

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:90%
more nonhuman or something.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> There's more biological
things going on inside the body

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, and that's why
we always refer to the reptilian

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
part of the brain.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, so--

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It might not be just
physical but inside.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it could be things that
are completely nonvisible from

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
an external visual cue,
but you could also--

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
if you're an expert
tinkerer, you

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.212 align:middle line:84%
could reduce the number of
physically identifiable results

00:16:09.212 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
from that so that
you wouldn't want

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
people to look suspicious
or have scales or something.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And one other thing, Randy--
we talked about this a long

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
time ago.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about the DNA and how

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that was modified in
some form or fashion,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and you knew about this, too.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way they could
eventually turn a dial,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
we do what they say?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Not from how I
understand how that works.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of the way
that the genetic code works--

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a map of
physical development

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't necessarily
follow a perfect pattern so

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
that if you're trying to
make a clone of a person,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
you could make a dozen different
clones and grow them up.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you
basically would have

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
to pick the one
that was the least

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:90%
mutated or the least deformed.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're using the
same exact blueprint,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting a dozen
different variations.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that the
DNA mechanism works that way.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I think there would have to
be some other technological

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:84%
mechanism or something that
overrides brain control, which

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
is super labor intensive and
super complicated and super

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.119 align:middle line:84%
difficult to have electronic
or computer control of 9

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
billion people or whatever we're
dealing with at the moment.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm less concerned
about something like that

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:84%
because my understanding
is it's not very feasible,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not an expert.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I suggested actually in one
other conversation that there

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
had been some effort to modify
the genetics of human people

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep the
level of evolution--

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh sure.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> --very low.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's definitely been
what we call the restrictors

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:84%
put on the system, so to keep us
from living more than 50 to 80

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
years, which we're supposed
to be way older than that.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to
have at least 300,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
400, 500, 600 years or
something like that.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So we can't grow
up into adulthood.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
We basically die when
we're still children,

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:84%
if you really want to do
the perspective that way.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So reducing our age span,
reducing certain ambitions

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
towards development,
conditioning the brain

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:84%
to maybe want to do things
that are more addictive or more

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.775 align:middle line:90%
personally satisfying--

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
those are all things
that can certainly

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
be used as control
mechanisms, and I

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
would think that
those are things

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that have been done over time
based on what we're looking

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:90%
at the result of, anyway.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> As someone coming
from topic of governance,

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm really interested in knowing
what the military is going

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to do about that.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Is there something?

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a complicated
subject that really could

00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:00.742 align:middle line:84%
involve way too much conversing
about way too much nuance if we

00:19:00.742 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:90%
were to get into much detail.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:90%
I would say this.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Within the last--
let's call it--

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
20 years, the military,
especially covert military

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
operations, has begun to
understand that there are

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
certain things in which
traditionally have not be seen

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
as national security issues
or national security threats,

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.290 align:middle line:84%
but now that we're looking
at certain things that are

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
endangering everybody's
well-being and all of civilized

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.125 align:middle line:84%
life and all of
social stability--

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the whole universe.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Then we basically have been
able to say, you know what?

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
These are not
traditionally the things

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that we categorize
as national security,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
but if we're
looking at outcomes,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
we have to consider these
things as national security.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So we've taken a little bit
of a different viewpoint

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and now have conversations
with various world leaders,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
military intelligence personnel,
elected officials to say,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:84%
look, we can't just suggest
that you do this anymore.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
We're telling you this is
a national security issue.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So either get on board,
or you're in the way.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And no one wants
to be in the way

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
when you tell them
that they need

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:90%
to be on board for something.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.713 align:middle line:84%
So at this point,
there are certain--

00:20:09.713 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many things
I would specifically speak to

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in a brief
conversation, but there

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
are certain things that have
to change for national security

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
reasons, not for
political reasons,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
not for social reasons,
not for economic reasons

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
but for how those things impact
national and global security.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're just not going to
let the ripples of discord

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
ruin the civilization
that has so much potential

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:84%
because some people
don't want to take

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:90%
their adult responsibility.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say
that some people are

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:84%
going to find themselves
grounded or with their nose

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.760 align:middle line:84%
in the corner as we
do here in the States

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
when you're in trouble if they
don't want to have their adult

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:50.220 align:middle line:90%
responsibilities.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're leaning pretty
hard on people at the moment

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.982 align:middle line:84%
that you have to do these
things not just because we're

00:20:56.982 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell you that
they do because they're

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.730 align:middle line:84%
national security reasons,
and if you don't do them,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:90%
you're making our job harder.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
making our job harder

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:90%
by making unadult decisions.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And also the overall
evolution of the universe,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:90%
affecting everyone.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There's definitely a
bigger and bigger scale,

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
but most people can't
understand it that way.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're just trying
to explain it to them.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
This is what matters, but
we certainly understand

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:90%
there's a--

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
our interaction with the
intergalactic community

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:90%
is significant.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I've said
this once or twice.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
We understand now as a
warrior species, which

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:90%
we understand that we are now.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.157 align:middle line:84%
For decades, other species
wanted to high-road us and tell

00:21:38.157 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:90%
us, you're too aggressive.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You're too violent,
until some other warrior

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
species came along and said,
no, we think you're smart.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're self-determined,
and you don't want someone

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:90%
to solve your problems.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to wait
around for somebody else's

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
police department to show
up to fix your stuff,

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:84%
so we think you're
smart to do that.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So now that we have
accepted that, we've

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
accepted that our role in
this corner of the galaxy

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:84%
is only going to develop
and grow further as that is

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.425 align:middle line:84%
concerned, which
means not only is

00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the global security
of the planet

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
we live on but the
national global security

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of this corner of
the galaxy is going

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to be dependent on whether
or not we successfully

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:90%
do our job or not.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't successfully
do that job, then yeah, dozens,

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
hundreds, thousands of
worlds could be affected.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:84%
If we do our job, the
same number of worlds

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:84%
could be affected
in a positive way.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And just one
follow-up question--

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:84%
how important do you think
is the time traveling

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
or experience from the future
in realizing how important

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.045 align:middle line:90%
disclosure right now is?

00:22:43.045 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say from what the
guys at Time Corps have said

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to me, it's very important, and
their job is to kind of nudge

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
us towards a direction
of positive outcomes.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
yeah, there's two paths.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
There's the path that you're
on if you don't change,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
path you have to be

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:90%
on if you don't want to die.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Failed timeline.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's either
go this way and die,

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:90%
or go this way and survive.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.183 align:middle line:90%
So that's really where we're at.

00:23:06.183 --> 00:23:06.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:23:06.983 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy has just explained
to us in a military way of how

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:90%
that works.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
How would you explain
that in a diplomatic way?

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So I totally agree.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that bringing
the perspective of future

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and also having the direct
experience of what could happen

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:84%
in the future was something
that was super, super

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:84%
important for global
governance to realize

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:90%
that changes must be done.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
involvement of future--

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:90%
let's call them-- time units.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they're
called in English,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
but their involvement seems
to be super important in order

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
to create awareness in the
policies and governance sector.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:90%
So I totally agree.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So that'll keep us on track
for the positive outcome.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:90%
I think that this species--

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be one of
the characteristics

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that everyone moves into
a certain direction, which

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:84%
could be bad, but they
need to reach a point where

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:84%
it's like a point of
self-destruction or catalysts

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And in order to prevent
that-- because I also

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
say that the overall evolution
of everything in the universe

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
depends on what's
happening right now.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.330 align:middle line:84%
In order to preserve
that, it was

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.533 align:middle line:84%
super important to have
an outlook for the future.

00:24:36.533 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, compared
to other planets,

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:84%
we have such a multitude of
races here as humans on this

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
planet, which makes it very
complicated with communication

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:90%
and, of course, war.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:84%
What needs to happen, Randy, for
us to get on that right track?

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good question.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think long
term, it's cooperation

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
towards mutually beneficial
goals and collective interests.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, I
think that we're not

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
going to get there
without what appear

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to be some very ugly conflicts
getting worse and resolving

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:84%
themselves through conflict
because I don't think anybody

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.032 align:middle line:84%
is pumping the brakes
on any of the conflicts

00:25:20.032 --> 00:25:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
globally at the moment.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of just
pumping the gas.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So tactically, I'd say
those things aren't

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.130 align:middle line:84%
going to happen or work out
until some people who really

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
want to bloody up each other's
noses start throwing punches.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think, if there
was a catastrophe or war,

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that it would bring
us closer together?

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what all the experts
are hoping is going to happen.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I would say I hope
for the same thing,

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and we seem to have a pattern
of collectively coming together

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
when we have
threats from outside

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
or that represent
a non-us equation,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
if you want to talk
about usses and thems.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So we hope that really, if
we can somehow get everybody

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to say, all right, this,
them, out here, not down here,

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
is who we want to be
mad at for the moment,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that maybe gets the us down
here to stop throwing rocks

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:90%
at each other.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Fingers crossed, we hope.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, what could you elaborate
on that through what you know

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:90%
diplomatically?

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I have just a little
different perspective on that

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
because I agree that the
talks have been there,

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that a conflict could unite
people, but then again,

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
there has been a lot of research
that something called a global

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
collective psychosis would be
a total worst-case scenario.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not wrong.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I would say
that when we look

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
at the contingencies of how
this could go very, very bad,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:84%
a kind of psychological,
psychotic cascade

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
could make everybody
really, really

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
crazy for more
than five minutes,

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and it would just be a
lot of bloodshed and tears

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:90%
before it got worked out.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But what would the powers
that be do in a time like that?

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably hide in their
bunkers, to be honest with you.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.562 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that they would
feel like that they'd have

00:27:11.562 --> 00:27:13.070 align:middle line:90%
much control if it went crazy.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you'd be left with
local law enforcement, state,

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
federal law enforcement,
and some of the military

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to try and keep minimal
order where they can apply

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:90%
the most efficient resources.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But right now, if you
were to ask the question

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:84%
if you had a kind of
global psychological,

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.855 align:middle line:90%
psychotic episode--

00:27:32.855 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Not them, yeah.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --we just don't have enough
cops, emergency technicians,

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.410 align:middle line:84%
firefighters, EMTs, surgeons,
emergency room technicians,

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
or soldiers to deal with 8
billion people or 9 going nuts.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, that could be
one possible timeline.

00:27:50.525 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe there
could be other timelines

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
or other scenarios
that are more positive?

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So I got to say that this
worst-case scenario that

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.415 align:middle line:84%
potentially could occur
would not only be a different

00:28:02.415 --> 00:28:03.215 align:middle line:90%
timeline.

00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
It would be a failed
timeline, and it'd

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
hadve, at least from
what we understand,

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:84%
a catastrophic effect on
potentially everything

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
in the universe because every
consciousness is connected.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And a worldwide psychosis
could lead to reality shifts

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:84%
to different really
catastrophic events.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But that being
said-- and also, this

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%
would be a failed timeline.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't work out--

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
to my understanding,
not everyone

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
who has been on this Earth
like 10 or 20 years ago

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:84%
will make contact to
nonterrestrial beings.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:50.510 align:middle line:84%
To my understanding, there are
unsolved patterns on Earth,

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and what the universe is
doing is mathematically

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:84%
bringing a bigger
ratio of experience

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:84%
into the system in order so we
can have find best practices

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and in order to cooperate
together, what you said, Randy.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So some people might experience
this shift differently,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
for example, activating
some hive consciousness,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:84%
some consciousness where
we're all connected,

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:84%
which means
nonterrestrial beings--

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be necessary
anymore because we all

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:36.060 align:middle line:84%
would agree upon being
one being, so to speak.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Could that also have
to do with genetic lineage

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of people
that do want this to happen?

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not too sure about that,
but I think it's more about

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:53.930 align:middle line:84%
the free will and the decision
a soul takes in order to figure

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:90%
out in which timeline you are.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Some people who might experience
this kind of shift of reality

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing right
now, because the Earth is

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:90%
heading towards that shift--

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:84%
they might experience a very
different reality right now,

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
a reality where we're all
connected, and it's peaceful.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I would agree with
Randy that there

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:84%
are lots and lots of unsolved
problems, and coming together,

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:84%
everything making
everything denser is chance

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.500 align:middle line:90%
in order to find solutions.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, earlier you said they
were tinkering with our DNA.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would extraterrestrials
allow the Draco to come in here

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:90%
and tinker with our DNA?

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say two
simple reasons.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.470 align:middle line:84%
One is the simplest military
tactical reason of all reasons,

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:84%
is the guy with the bigger
muscles and the bigger club

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:90%
wins.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the Dracos are
formidable militarily,

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:84%
so there's a lot of species
that simply would not

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.610 align:middle line:84%
have a say because
they don't have

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:90%
a Force that could oppose them.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.360 align:middle line:90%
The second reason would be time.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Some species experience
time a little bit

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
differently, so a decade, a
hundred years, a thousand years

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:90%
isn't the same.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So often, especially
the older species,

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
they see genetic
projects as a garden

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
project where they're
like, OK, we've

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.670 align:middle line:90%
tended the garden for a minute.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go away, and
we'll come back and check on it

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.580 align:middle line:90%
in just a minute.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But a minute might be
a century, 1,500 years.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So when they come back,
something else has happened.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.873 align:middle line:84%
They go, oh, now we're going
to have to adjust for this,

00:31:28.873 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't
mean that they're

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
going to immediately go, oh,
how dare you come in and mess

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:90%
with our system.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They kind of go, well,
now this has happened.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting
violent about it,

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:84%
we're just going to
have a different plan,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:90%
tinker this way, do that.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases, they
don't have a choice.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, it's
about someone else

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
who has a different
sense of what

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.160 align:middle line:84%
tactical time in a
10-year, 20, 30, 40,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:84%
50-year period is
versus someone who's

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.260 align:middle line:84%
trying to do development
over centuries

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:90%
or thousands of years.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when someone's willing
to get in and mess it up,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:84%
it interferes if someone
doesn't have the direct ability

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:90%
to militarily stomp on them.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.302 align:middle line:84%
Or the alternative is, well, we
could go in there and get them,

00:32:11.302 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:84%
but how many people
are we going to kill?

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.770 align:middle line:84%
How much of our own civilization
that we're trying to grow here

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.090 align:middle line:90%
are we going to damage?

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's the question
of, do you cut out

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
a cancer that might
kill the patient,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:84%
or do you try to
treat the patient

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:90%
with the cancer in them?

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Tim, could you comment on that?

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally agree, 100%.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that one
thing that we can add

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is that some species tend
to do things covertly,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and that is something--
to figure that out,

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:84%
it took some time,
especially when we're

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:84%
talking about certain reptilian
races that take advantage

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.070 align:middle line:90%
of certain things.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:33:01.670 align:middle line:84%
They are not doing that in
the front view or something.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it secretly,
and to my understanding,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.200 align:middle line:84%
lots and lots of
species have not

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
understood what's happening
on Earth for some time.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very good point,
and I would have to say when we

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.070 align:middle line:84%
certainly talk to other species
about what they think is going

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:84%
on here, the conversation
usually ends with us saying,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you're not
wrong about that.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But we know our people a
little bit better than you,

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and so we kind of
think that that's not

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.905 align:middle line:84%
the best way to look
at it because we

00:33:34.905 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:90%
understand a little better.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, other species
often can be very smart,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
can be very evolved,
but it does not

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
mean that they understand
someone other than themselves

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.740 align:middle line:84%
as well as they
understand themselves.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have a hard
time understanding

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:84%
other species the way
we understand ourselves.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Why would that be not
true for another species?

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:90%
So I think we're complicated.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
We're complex to understand.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
species underestimate us.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't fully
understand our psychology

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.883 align:middle line:84%
or our emotional development,
and so sometimes,

00:34:03.883 --> 00:34:06.050 align:middle line:84%
when they think, well, we
should do this or do that,

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking from their own
perspective of what they would

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:90%
do with their own species.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And as we get more and more
in control of the show,

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:84%
we're able to say, you're
not wrong about that,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.653 align:middle line:84%
but we really think
there's a better way

00:34:17.653 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:84%
to do that since we understand
our own people better

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:90%
than you do.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:84%
>> And most of those
are just conversations.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.264 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we yell and scream
and go, you're not doing that.

00:34:25.264 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It's more like,
that's a good idea,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.489 align:middle line:84%
but we think maybe
we should do it

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.947 align:middle line:84%
like this because our people
will respond to it differently

00:34:30.947 --> 00:34:32.129 align:middle line:90%
if you do this or that.

00:34:32.129 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:33.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:34:33.729 --> 00:34:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it also possible, fellas,
that there are species that are

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
covertly compartmentalizing
their own stuff with us,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.574 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know what
the other one's doing?

00:34:44.574 --> 00:34:45.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's
actually very true.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you asked that.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:90%
So no, we certainly have done--

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:90%
I get a lot of cases.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
People come to me who
are having issues,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:84%
whether it's abduction
issues, implant issues,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:90%
different things.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Some people I cannot help.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I try.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Other people, when they
bring certain information

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.040 align:middle line:84%
or certain lucidity
to their experience,

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.100 align:middle line:84%
then we can get data, and
we can answer questions.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been finding
in doing that research

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:84%
is how many compartmentalized
programs within other species

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.700 align:middle line:84%
that are doing
things that if you

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
go through the normal chain
of bureaucratic communication

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.123 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, we think your
species is doing something,

00:35:22.123 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:84%
they go, we're not
doing anything.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're like look,
we know you are.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.200 align:middle line:84%
We see them, they go,
hey, those guys aren't

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.345 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be doing that.

00:35:28.345 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
letting them know

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.272 align:middle line:84%
that they have an own-world
program or something that's

00:35:32.272 --> 00:35:34.730 align:middle line:84%
being happening covert that
they didn't know was happening.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does happen.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of this before?

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the
information on the Draco

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that I have are actually
coming from the Greys who are

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:90%
in kind of conflict with them.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's second-hand
information for me

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and also a topic where I don't
feel not that much comfortable

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.880 align:middle line:90%
speaking about.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So I was really happy to
or at least really excited

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:90%
to find that out with you.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Tim, what do you think is
going to be the answer to this?

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not all death and despair.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
got to be someone

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:90%
out there looking out for us.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, true, absolutely.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm not too
happy and comfortable

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:84%
speaking about all those
conflicts-- because, again,

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm super interested in
finding exit strategies,

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and I strongly
advocate the universe

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
where everything cooperates
and to mutual benefits.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
are more and more

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
realizing how important is
that we're all connected

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and that we need
to come together,

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:52.280 align:middle line:84%
have those communication and
topics that Randy spoke about.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And I find it pretty relieving
to have people care about that

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as feeling
responsible for myself

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:06.590 align:middle line:84%
in order to heal everything and
to get on the right timeline.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, beautiful, Tim.

00:37:07.978 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you, Tim,
and thank you, Randy,

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.450 align:middle line:90%
for being on the show.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.680 align:middle line:90%

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever's happening on
Earth is directly affecting

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the collective memory
of the whole species.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The military perspective
is pretty straightforward.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
there are two choices.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.180 align:middle line:84%
We either move towards
type 1 civilization,

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.250 align:middle line:90%
or we go back to the Bronze Age.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Human beings,
at least on Earth,

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:84%
they have a very high potential
in becoming a very evolved

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:45.210 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There are clearly patterns of
evolution, patterns of growth,

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and we can certainly help and
benefit each other from those

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.850 align:middle line:90%
collective experiences for sure.
