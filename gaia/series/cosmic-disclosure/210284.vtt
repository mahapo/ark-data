>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:10%
a retired counterintelligence
agent who served in the Air

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Force Office of
Special Investigations.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts
trying to understand

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:10%
the missions and the strategies
of non-human intelligences

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:10%
on our planet.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:90%

>> The pyramids have been the
world's greatest mysteries.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about any
military or agencies

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that have obtained information
or artifacts from them?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I've had access
to information pertaining

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to the exploration
of the pyramids

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
by the United States government
as far back as the 1930s.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
We gained access
to some information

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:90%
from some source in the 1930s.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And back in those
days, very little

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:90%
was known about the pyramids.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians knew what
they were, obviously,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and they've done
their own exploration,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:90%
but not as detailed as we did.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We sent a secret team in to the
pyramid area, the area of Giza

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and the other pyramids in
Egypt, to explore them.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We knew they were something
special back then.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:90%
We did a little bit at a time.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
We went back some years
later, a few years later,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and explored more.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Then unfortunately,
World War II occurred,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
and we had to stop that.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, take over the Germans.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
The Germans were highly
interested in the pyramids.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
They sent a number of
expeditions down there,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
some we can read
about today, and some

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that are probably still
hidden away in the archives.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
"Indiana Jones" supposedly is
based on an actual incident

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
involving US
intelligence interfering

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
with the German intelligence
during the early days of World

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:90%
War II.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'd like to
hear from Tim on that.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What we know is that the
Germans at that time were

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
pretty interested in
not only pyramids,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
but mostly every kind of
mysterious fact of history

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:90%
And the Germans--

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Hitler sent troops to Egypt.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
They heard rumors about
a certain civilization

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
that could have used and
built the pyramids way back.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And also, they had
this mystical thinking

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted
to do research on.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, they basically found
that these pyramids either

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
could have been used or have
been used as power plants

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:90%
or power devices.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is something the
Germans became aware of.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And we can see this is the
time when Nikola Tesla already

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:84%
had done extensive research
on high-frequency, energetic

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And the physics
were ready for that.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans at
that time basically

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
had already a loose
idea about what

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:90%
they were going to find there.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>> After World War II, once the
Central Intelligence Agency was

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
formed in 1947, in the early
'50s, the CIA sent a team back

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:90%
to the pyramids.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
This time, they
spent a lot of time

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
on the Sphinx and
another pyramid.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
They found that if they placed
a signal collector-- now,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.762 align:middle line:84%
back in those days, a signal
generator wasn't found yet.

00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that generated

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:90%
frequencies or gathering them.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:90%
But they had something crude.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were finding that there
were frequencies coming out

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
of these pyramids, and they
couldn't figure out why.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.899 align:middle line:84%
They first thought there was
some type of maybe a radio

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
station or something that
was interfering with them,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't have
the technical equipment

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
during that time period
to analyze those signals.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Later on, in 1959,
they went back

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
with a really detailed,
well-manned team of scientists,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.895 align:middle line:90%
even some Egyptians.

00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The first time they actually
entered these pyramids--

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:90%
they found a way to enter them.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the pyramids, they
detected hundreds and hundreds

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.452 align:middle line:90%
of signals being generated.

00:04:52.452 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't understand
where they were coming from,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
thinking that maybe there
was some sort of transmitter

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:84%
inside these pyramids,
but they couldn't find it.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know how it worked.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our technology
back in the late '50s

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:90%
wasn't advanced as it is today.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So later on, in 1967, they
went back with other equipment,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and they detected
unique frequencies.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
The thing about that
unique frequency coming

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and out of these two main
pyramids that they were looking

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
at, and also the
Sphinx, was that they

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
were the exact same
frequencies that they

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
found coming out of a
pyramid in Southern Mexico.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
So how can that be?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And how can there be
the same frequencies?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And how are they
being generated?

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
they've later determined.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
But, Tim, do you know about
these frequencies that

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
are being generated
out of these pyramids?

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, indeed.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So we did some studies on
the pyramids quite recently,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:90%
a few years back.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
We found that by the way it has
been built, that they naturally

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:84%
attract certain ions
from the atmosphere,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
because what we know is
that the planet itself

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
has certain layers where you
have more and more frequential

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:84%
ions that are positively
and negatively charged.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And you have a lot of voltage,
so to speak, going on there.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So the way the
pyramids are built up

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to the material they are using,
they create a natural flow

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:90%
from the top to the bottom.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
You have different materials
at different stages

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, and it
guides these natural

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
occurring energies pretty
much down this machine.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there seems to
be a natural current that

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%
comes from these pyramids.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
But through somebody having
destroyed the outer cover which

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
used to be around the pyramid,
the ions that are getting

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:84%
charged cannot be holed
inside of the pyramid,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
which is the actual functional
mechanism the pyramids need

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:90%
in order to fully function.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Someone has broken this cover.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And due to that,
they're out of power

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:10%
and they do not work anymore
because the ions just

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:10%
get loose.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> That coincides with what some
of the top scientists who were

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
working for the Central
Intelligence Agency and other

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:84%
agencies found when they went to
the pyramids back in the '80s.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, over the years,
the US government

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
has conducted a number
of secret programs.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if the
Egyptians were aware of these.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they probably have now.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But where they went in
and collected artifacts

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
inside these pyramids.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's 118, I
believe, pyramids in Egypt.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And they found some of the
pyramids to be built with,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
as Tim said, a sheath that
maintained or collected energy

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there was some way that
that energy was then dispersed.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
They found that when they went
inside these pyramids, some

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:84%
of the most remote pyramids
that few people know about,

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
some that have been damaged
over the thousands of years,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
they found really unique
things about these damaged

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
pyramids, where the team would
go in and they would lose time.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:90%
They'd go in.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.378 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
they would time--

00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
there would be a clipboard
where somebody would--

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --and they would put a tag
on the back of that person.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, you went in at 1300
hours, using military time.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd
time that person.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And that person would
keep this watch.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, then next thing
you know, this person

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:84%
will come out six hours later
and thought they were only

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
in there for 20 minutes.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.255 align:middle line:90%
Well, how did that happen?

00:09:25.255 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
How did how did they
miss time inside--

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:84%
not the pyramids that were
not damaged, but the ones that

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:90%
had been damaged?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.215 align:middle line:84%
So scientists studied
that phenomena

00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
for many, many,
many years, writing

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of different
papers and trying

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
to understand frequencies.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Scientists,
theoretical physicists,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
even the Institute
for Advanced Studies,

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
where I worked with Dr. Puthoff,
they studied that phenomena,

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:90%
trying to understand why--

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Time displacement.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> --why there was
time displacement.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And you would talk to these
people when they'd come out.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, OK,
I went in at 1400 hours,

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:90%
an hour later.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And the monitor
now says that they

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:90%
had been in there six hours.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.570 align:middle line:90%
How can it be?

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So is there some
kind of a time warp?

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind
of a stargate?

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Did they go in
through a portal where

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
they went not in this dimension,
but in another dimension?

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Did it disrupt their
thinking and their ability

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
to rationalize time?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:84%
These are all questions
that scientists

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:90%
are trying to answer today.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard, do we know
what those frequencies are?

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And could they be measured?

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they were measured.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:90%
And we know what they are.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of the information is
probably still classified.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But they were up in the
gigahertz range of frequencies.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a
frequency expert, but I

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
know gigahertz is somewhere
around satellite frequencies

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that they use to
communicate with satellites.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So they're in a wavelength
that didn't exist

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
or we didn't know
existed thousands

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
of years ago during
the Egyptian period

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and when these
things were built.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago,
there was nothing

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
known about
frequencies, obviously.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, we're still
learning about frequencies.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about
terahertz frequencies.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond the
gigahertz frequencies.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So we know what the
frequencies are.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we measured
them, comparing the frequencies

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the
Egyptian pyramids

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
to the ones that are coming
out of the Mexico pyramids.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure they measured
the pyramids in other locations

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:90%
in Central America.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I know they did an expedition to
Belize to measure that pyramid.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know about
Peru, and I don't

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:90%
have any information on that.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But they know what
the frequencies are,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and they're studying them.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Did we learn anything from
Ebe 1 about the pyramids?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we did.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
During the time Ebe
was here and after we

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
were able to implant something
in his throat in order

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
for him to speak, he quickly,
of course, learned English.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It was crude, but we
could understand him.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
What he told us after he learned
what our physics were crudely

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in our time periods,
he explained

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
that there were structures--
he didn't call them pyramids,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
but he called them structures--
around the world that

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
were built by a cooperation
between humans and the ETs,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:84%
which we would call
pyramids, all over the world.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know our
geography, but he refers--

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
when his handlers
showed him maps,

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
he quickly grasped the
locations and said, yes, we

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
assisted in the construction
of some of these

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:90%
what you call pyramids.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said they were
navigational beacons.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:90%
They were how we navigated.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just Earth.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Other planets they visited, they
built some kind of a structure

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:90%
where they could navigate.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, it might be crude to us,
but if it was as sophisticated

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago,
it was something

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that their technology
had developed then.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it navigation, Richard,
amongst the stars or navigation

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:90%
around the planet?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It was navigation
around the planet.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's for other spacecrafts
visiting Earth to hone in on,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:90%
such as the Middle East.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that
Ebe later on, before he passed

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
away, told us was they were very
interested in the Middle East.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, they didn't name countries
or anything like that.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But on our map,
once he figured out

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:84%
where he was, and so forth,
the navigational system--

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
they were very interested
in the Middle East.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Why was it so special to him?

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some sort of
healing powers that he was

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain to us that
could occur in the sand,

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
really sandy areas,
such as the Middle East.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that
we fully understood,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
he was telling us

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
or that he fully understood
what we were trying to get out

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.395 align:middle line:84%
of him, but there
were healing powers

00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
that were present in the
Middle East that wasn't

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:90%
present at other locations.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Middle East, of
course, included Egypt.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of healing
powers from the pyramids

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:84%
through your connections
with extraterrestrials?

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what we found out
through extensive communication

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:84%
with nonterrestrial
intelligence is

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that the very first
pyramid, which

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
was the one in
Giza, the great one,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
was mostly built
outside of time.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that defies, so to speak,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
reality in a way that
there's an equivalent

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
outside of time, which is
like a pyramid turnover.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But we then quickly learned
that the pyramid itself not only

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
had one function,
or two or three,

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:90%
but a multitude of functions.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a super clever
design which is, in fact,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
made by an intelligence that
has no representation in 3D.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is outside of reality

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and enables reality the
way we perceive it now.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But they told us it stabilizes
the way the planet works.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It indeed has
healing capabilities.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
It had enhancing
meditative powers which

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
can be used in order to
gain access back and forth

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:90%
with source itself.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.538 align:middle line:84%
It also functions as
a power supply system

00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
that connects all these
different structures

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
There was more
than one function.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And we got our hands
on certain plans

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
where you can see that there
are more than those chambers

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:90%
that we officially know of.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things
that we found--

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.353 align:middle line:84%
the US government found
in some of the artifacts--

00:16:43.353 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
our government thinks that
some of these artifacts that we

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:84%
found inside these pyramids
were used to facilitate healing.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:10%
Without that particular device,
there wouldn't be any healing.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I think a person well known
to Gaia, Johnny Enoch,

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.789 align:middle line:84%
talked about this, that
these devices, these sticks,

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
these cones, these things
that were found deep

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
inside the pyramid in
some secret chambers

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
were some kind of
healing powers.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.704 align:middle line:84%
But if you take these
outside the pyramid,

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:90%
they didn't do anything.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And the same way with
the frequency generation.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:84%
If you took some of
these artifacts outside

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and took them to
another country,

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:84%
brought them back to the United
States or some laboratory

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt--

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --they didn't
generate any frequencies.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Only inside the pyramids
somehow, and I don't know how.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It's charging
them somehow, huh?

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:84%
There had been
experiments years ago

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
where they placed batteries in
the pyramid and they charged.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:90%
And other things have charged.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So it has some kind of healing
generation of energy powers,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:90%
as Tim talked about.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned sand
contributes to healing

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Could you explain that?

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Ebe didn't
fully explain that to us,

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
but he was fascinated with us
knowing about the pyramids,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
the questions that
we were asking him.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But he centered his
attention on the Middle East

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:90%
and telling us that the sand--

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and once he explained
what it was,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
we knew exactly what
he was talking about--

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
contained some kind
of healing powers.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.865 align:middle line:84%
And like I said earlier, I don't
know that we fully understood

00:18:28.865 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:90%
how he was explaining it.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some
type of healing powers.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.472 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know they
brought him sand, but--

00:18:38.472 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That was my next question.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> --being in Los Alamos, the
sand came from probably White

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Sands or New Mexico.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any information.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I never read any of the
detailed debriefings about

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:90%
whether that sand helped or not.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But he specifically
told the handler,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
the captain that was his
handler, that the Middle East--

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
he was showing us where
the Middle East was--

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the sand there generated healing
powers for them, for the Ebens.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.452 align:middle line:84%
>> It must be a frequency-based
reflection or something that

00:19:14.452 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
the sand is giving off.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Tim?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What we do know is that the
materials that have been used

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:84%
in order to build these
structures are specifically

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:90%
chosen.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not randomly chosen, but
they are specifically chosen.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So from the top, the
pyramidium, until the ground

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:84%
itself, they all conduct
a certain movement

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Later on, they even put gold
onto the top of the pyramid,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
but science made it pretty
clear that this wasn't

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
even necessary at all because
the material that already was

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:90%
there had already done the job.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned earlier about
the artifacts that were found

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
inside the pyramid
during these expeditions.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us more
about these artifacts?

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And also, did you
find any bodies?

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we didn't.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I've never read anything about
bodies being found in there

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
or mummified remains
or anything like that.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.316 align:middle line:84%
I think that they weren't
looking for those.

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
These artifacts were
wands, swords, chalices,

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
aluminum material that
were left in there

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
for some particular reason,
whether it was there

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
for the mummified remains or
whether the ETs or somebody

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
else left them there.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I've never read anything
about-- all of them--

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:90%
they talk about the artifacts.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
They talk about what
was found in there.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's pictures of
artifacts that were taken out

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.170 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids all over.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And Jonny Enoch has
a whole presentation

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:90%
about some of these artifacts.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know everything
about the artifacts,

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
nor do I know
everything that's made.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I know and
I read was those artifacts,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:84%
our scientists believe that
they were for healing only

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:90%
inside the pyramids.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
If you take them
out, they didn't

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
generate energy or
frequencies to do any healing.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a story that's
circulating in our group which

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
said that the Americans were on
a mission in the 1990s around

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, and that they
opened an underground chamber

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and found a still-living ET
being that was down there

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and left over from whoever
inhabited that area at that

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
true because, again, this

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
is referring to the
United States Army.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But the story itself was quite
fascinating because they always

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
were speaking about that
this being, in particular,

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
was kind of a guardian,
and it was in this chamber,

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and it was super old.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And so people were
at least assuming

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that this life form
itself was there

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
about 5,000 years ago living
in this chamber, which

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:90%
was totally, completely sealed.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So there was no
circulation of air.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:84%
There was no nutrition,
no food, no water.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And this was
basically the story.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So people were chatting
about and wondering

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
how this life form,
which they even

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
described with a tail,
which was down there,

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
how it could survive that long.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> What did it look like?

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And again, I'm not sure
if this is official or not,

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
but it's just something that
circulated in the group was

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:90%
that it's less humanoid.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It had some kind of
very dark grey skin,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
a weird more or less triangular
head, and a long tail.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And they were assuming that
it's a guard to this chamber.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And from what I've heard, it
was at least 5,000 years old.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, amazing.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.745 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if
you know about this.

00:23:36.745 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's a
story that, actually,

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
we at the Institute for Advanced
Studies got hold of that.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that it came out
some time in the early

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:84%
'90s or mid-'90s or something,
that a team from NATO that went

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
there-- and I don't know if
any of this is true or not,

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:84%
but the story we got was
similar to what he said,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:90%
was that a team went in there.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't hear that it
was just an American team.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a joint team.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, a team
went in this one chamber

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and found this live
being in this chamber.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:10%
And according to
what I'd read, it

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:10%
had a headdress similar
to what a Egyptian would

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:10%
be wearing 5,000 years ago.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And now, that's
somewhat of a triangle--

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could compare
that to a triangle-- had

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:90%
very strange hands and arms.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It was somewhat lethargic
when the team found him.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd say so after 5,000 years.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think they figured
that it was surviving on energy.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:84%
It was some type of a being that
could gain strength or maintain

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.950 align:middle line:84%
its health through
energy from the pyramids.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the story we got.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we did a lot
of investigations on that,

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and we confirmed that there
was a team that went there.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
commanders of the team--

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember his rank.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
United States Army--

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:90%
told the story.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
there wasn't internet back

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:84%
in those days, so
it got through--

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was in
some kind of a magazine.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it was connected
to a science fiction book

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
some years ago that
somebody wrote.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:90%
So I've heard it all.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And Tim had a good description
of what he remembers,

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and I have mine.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether that actually
happened-- or, of course,

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
my question was,
and our question,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
what we wanted to know was,
what happened to the ET?

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
If you found an ET in there,
is he in Area 51 or where did

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:90%
he go?

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Or is he in Egypt?

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Is Egypt keeping him?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Have either one of you
heard in the last decade about

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:84%
a joint American
expedition to Giza,

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:07.870 align:middle line:84%
where they actually snaked a
1,000-foot fiber optic camera

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:84%
down in there, and they saw
underneath the pyramid a huge

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:84%
city the size of Rome, with
statues and rock floors.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And I did see parts
of that video,

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know if it's real.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about this?

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:10%
>> What I think I remembered
from the documents

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:10%
and the research being done on
the pyramid is that not only

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.880 align:middle line:10%
below the pyramid in Egypt,
but also below the pyramids

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:10%
in Mexico--

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Mexico, right.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> --you find a
reservoir of water,

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:84%
which adds to the currency
flow, the electrical charge

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's necessary for the whole
design of the pyramid as well.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I can't actually believe that
there is a city below that,

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:84%
but there is indeed a reservoir
of water, or used to be.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Were any of the
artifacts discovered clearly

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:90%
nonterrestrial?

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Some of the artifacts that
were taken back and studied

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
at some laboratories like Sandia
National Laboratories and Los

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Alamos National Laboratories,
where they can go down

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to the molecular structure
of these artifacts

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to determine what
they're made of,

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and they found that
some of them contained

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
materials that clearly
didn't come from this planet.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And some of the materials
that we could identify

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
were fused in such a way that we
didn't have a method on Earth,

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:84%
even then, even in
the '90s or the 2000s,

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:54.140 align:middle line:84%
that could make these things,
fusing things like zinc

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and other things together,
especially 5,000 years ago.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these artifacts
are carbon dated.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were carbon dated
to 5,000 or 6,000 years ago.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:90%
So we knew they were old.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:90%
And who made them?

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't have been made
by any of Earth's civilizations

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:90%
that long ago.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
material, I think

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:84%
two or three different
elements of the material,

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:84%
was found in such minute
quantities on Earth,

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:84%
but we knew then that
this material is found

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.970 align:middle line:90%
in space in other planets.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:90%
So who made them?

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:84%
They would have had to have been
an extraterrestrial race that

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
created these things and
gave them maybe as a gift

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:84%
to the occupants of the pyramids
or the occupants of that area,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:90%
of Giza.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What else in the excavations
that was discovered that may

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:90%
point to nonhuman life?

00:28:54.270 --> 00:29:02.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in one of the damaged
pyramids in the South of Giza,

00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:84%
the one that was
heavily damaged--

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall the
name of that one--

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
they did find an
exoskeleton of an ET.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And we know it was because
we had that material,

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:84%
we had that skeletal
structure of that ET

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:84%
in our laboratory that we had
recovered in a prior crash

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:84%
some years ago, probably
in the '60s or '70s.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that skeletal
structure was that of an ET.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.475 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The exploration team
found that in one

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.380 align:middle line:90%
of those damaged pyramids.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What did that
skeleton look like?

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Did it look human?

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Do they know that race
already, you said,

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:90%
because it's familiar looking?

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was
definitely an ET.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said they compared
that skeletal structure

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:90%
with what they've already had.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was a small,
4-foot being--

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:90%
the skeletal structure.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a medical specialist.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had never seen
an autopsy of one.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But the skeletal structure of
an Eben or the smaller Greys

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.030 align:middle line:90%
are distinct.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
They're totally different
than that of a human.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had discussions
with Dr. Kit Green about this.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't look like us.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you find something,
you recognize it

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.390 align:middle line:90%
as extraterrestrial.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you know
something more

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.400 align:middle line:84%
about the skeletal
structure of the Greys.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm not a medical
professional as well.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys use a
fiber-printed material,

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:84%
which enables them to be doing
all these missions that they

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:90%
do in this planet.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that the Ebens have
indeed a skeleton structure

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.400 align:middle line:84%
because they are,
well, biological life

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:90%
forms in that way.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't do an
autopsy on them.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the pyramids
developed by humans pre-flood

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrials?

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We have received by fact a
timeline from Being Six about

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:90%
this question.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So what they told us is that
the very first pyramid, which

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
was the Great Pyramid in Giza,
was built outside of time,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.840 align:middle line:84%
but means it also created
the observable time

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.860 align:middle line:90%
that we have on this planet.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is a nonreality
aspect to this pyramid.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:84%
All the other pyramids
that came later on

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:84%
were a combined effort
between certain ET races, who

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.770 align:middle line:84%
gave the technology as
a gift, and the humans

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:04.205 align:middle line:84%
that were inhabiting
that space at that time.

00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Do the pyramids resonate in
another dimension at the same

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:90%
time as this dimension?

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, 100%.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.340 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to grasp.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:10%
What they have told us--

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:22.460 align:middle line:10%
Being Six-- is that outside
of time, the universe itself

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:10%
is projecting its awareness out
into the wild, extensive fields

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:10%
of probabilities, and it's
looking for paradoxes, which

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:40.670 align:middle line:10%
they explain us as clouds
of controversial ideas

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:10%
that need decisions,
otherwise they

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:10%
keep on being undefined spots
in the universe that cry,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, for
definition in some way.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So what the universe
then has done

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:01.530 align:middle line:84%
is creating these pyramidal
structures that resemble

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.735 align:middle line:90%
this tetrahedron geometry.

00:33:04.735 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, tetrahedron.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the one you see on
Gaia that's moving along.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if the polygons that
create this perceivable reality

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
are structured in
a similar geometry.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And through imitating
this inside and outside

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:84%
of time, the universe
itself has a way

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:90%
to perceive itself in time.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:42.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's not by chance
that the pyramid itself

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:10%
has certain algorithms
that resonate

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.710 align:middle line:10%
with the speed of light as well.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Tim, are the pyramids here on
planet Earth also connected

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.040 align:middle line:90%
to pyramids on other planets?

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> 100% yes.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:84%
That is actually what
Being Six told us,

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
that any other planet
has its own pyramids.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:84%
They have this
very first pyramid

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:90%
as much as the Earth has it.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's meant to
be placed there

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:90%
in order to perceive time--

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Reality.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually,
it's light and time,

00:34:21.134 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:84%
so the relationship
between time and light.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why they put it there.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is also the reason
why you find this eye--

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.070 align:middle line:90%
the eye everywhere in Egypt.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It indicates it's the universe
that is observing itself

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a way to use the
pyramid to accelerate ourselves

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:90%
out of this third density?

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, 100%.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.680 align:middle line:10%
This is actually what
Being Six described.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It functions the other
way around as well.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's been done many times
with the humans at that time.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
They entered certain chambers,
and their consciousness

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:17.460 align:middle line:84%
went back to this wild field
where it's not observing time.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And basically, these
strange effects

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:90%
are reported throughout history.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:29.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, Napoleon,
who slept there one night,

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:32.235 align:middle line:84%
he mentioned this
reality-bending effect

00:35:32.235 --> 00:35:33.990 align:middle line:90%
on his consciousness.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But yes, 100%, they
are exits as well.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Weren't they being used
by the pharaohs and the--

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, the medical witch
doctors back in that time?

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.910 align:middle line:84%
If you could go in there
and spend one night

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.640 align:middle line:84%
without killing
yourself or leaving,

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.050 align:middle line:84%
then you have obtained a
higher level of consciousness.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's what happens
later on in history.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So Being Six, when they gave us
this timeline of incidents that

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:13.980 align:middle line:84%
happened, they describe that
later on, those early cultures

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.450 align:middle line:84%
pretty much evolved their
society around the pyramids.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there was
a class of priests

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that were doing all these
meditative experiments

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:90%
in the pyramids.
