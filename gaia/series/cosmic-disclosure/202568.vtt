>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are with Randy Cramer.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.030 align:middle line:10%
Randy shares with
us his experience

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:10%
in the Secret Space Program
called the Earth Defense Force.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are what you
refer to as these bad actors

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, statistically, we find
that of the species that we

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
encounter, we have a breakdown
that we call the 95/5.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Which means
approximately 95% of them

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
are more interested in trade
and friendly relations,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:90%
than they are being hostile.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
It's that 5% that we refer
to as the bad actors.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
necessarily interested

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
in some form of kind,
reasonable trade prospect.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
They would rather steal things,
raid things, scavenge things,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
pirate things, or conquer
things in such a way that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:90%
are less than friendly.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's the 95/5 ratio
that we talk about.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about
tens of thousands of species,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:90%
5% can be a lot.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:84%
5% can be a pretty
good-sized number.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> What type of beings?

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.425 align:middle line:90%
And why are they bad actors?

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's start with
a couple of the classics.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people are familiar with
the Draconians and the Zeta

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Reticulins.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And so, these are
bad actors who are

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
using the advanced
technology that they

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:90%
have for genetic alteration.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:90%
To cripple a species.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
To make them compliant
as slave labor.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:90%
To draw resources from.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Use as a food source.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.622 align:middle line:84%
Or to hybridize
genetics between--

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking
about the Zetas--

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
in order for the Zetas
to create hybrid children

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to get some of their
evolutionary soul back,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It's complicated subject that
I won't spend too much time on.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But those are the, sort
of, classic bad actors

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that we understand
who don't necessarily

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:90%
like to play by the rules.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Don't necessarily like to
obey intergalactic norms.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But we have other
bad actors other

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:90%
than planetary conquerors.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
You have scavengers
who are a threat

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to just show up, grab
or steal something

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that they can grab a quantity
of in a short amount of time

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:90%
and then run away with it.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.435 align:middle line:90%
You have mercenaries.

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What are these plasmin
mercenaries you speak of?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So plasmin mercenaries come from
a species in the Hydra system.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
They are a plasmid, which means
that they are what appears

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
to be a gelatinous liquid.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
That seems to have almost,
like, neon-colored lights inside

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.362 align:middle line:90%
And they're shape-shifters.

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I've worked
on these beings.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:90%
They're weird.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And their ability
to take that mass

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and move it into different
shapes, different textures

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:90%
makes them ideal to be sneaky.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So they've accepted that
role in the universe--

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
that they're really good at
being sneaky and pretending

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:90%
to be other things.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Which makes them good to
be mercenaries, assassins,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they are fine to do
it for profit and for money.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
care, otherwise.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, as a species,
they lack some

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
of what we consider to be
the ethical moral center.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that they're
all bad or evil or nefarious.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
It just means they, kind of,
don't care about other people's

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:90%
moral or ethical standards.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And they'll, pretty much, do
whatever serves their interest.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What jurisdiction do
they fall under, then?

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Who is protecting us
from these mercenaries?

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because they're not a
large military force or a large

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
planetary conquering force,
they fall under the jurisdiction

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:90%
of local law enforcement.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is the local
investigating law enforcement

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:84%
apparatus in the
corner of the galaxy

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that you might be in would
fall under their jurisdiction.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
our own system, we

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.570 align:middle line:84%
have our own
investigative personnel

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and our own law enforcement
personnel who deal with that.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And who investigate
and will arrest.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And, in some cases, even
imprison them, if necessary.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Often, the military
ends up being

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
the persons who are
apprehending or capturing them

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But usually then,
they're turned over.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they like space pirates?

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
They're just all over
the place spread out?

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they're mercenaries.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We kind of think
about pirates as being

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:90%
this other slice of the pie.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So if I was going to continue
to talk about other bad actors,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I could go from plasmid
mercenaries to pirates.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And so piracy, it's
not just for the 1700s.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, there are trade
vehicles going back and forth

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
You have places in space
that are very secure, very

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:90%
well-monitored.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.565 align:middle line:84%
And then you have places that
are less monitored, less,

00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:84%
sort of, policed, which makes
it ripe for pirate activity.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So if pirates get wind of
a trade root of something

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that could be valuable
for them to steal,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:84%
then they just might come
along and rob your ship

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:90%
and steal from you.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And if they're, sort of,
the kinder, gentler variety

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
of pirate, they'll
just take your stuff.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
If they're the nastier
strain of pirate,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
they might take
you and your stuff.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And sell you into slavery
or keep you as slaves.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Or eat you.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever other thing
that you might be good for.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So, again, pirates are different
classes of different persons

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
within different species.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So, again, these aren't
organized military factions.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
They can be privateers
of certain species

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:84%
who have access to
space technology.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Or, in some cases, these
can be individual ships

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
who have accumulated a
broad spectrum of species

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:90%
into their crews of--

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
again, much the way in
which pirates and privateers

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:90%
of terrestrial past did--

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:84%
you hire whoever is
ready to be a pirate.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is ready to
sign on and do whatever.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
To steal the goods and
party about it later.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:90%
So pirates are kind of pirates.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's a thing.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a crime and
punishment issue, for sure.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you can validate
something for me.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not firsthand
information for me.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It was second-hand
information given to me.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We have mafias here
on planet Earth.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Politicians, the police can get
paid off to do certain things.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I was told that there actually
is, like, different types

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:90%
of space mafias out there.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
That trade goes on to
allow certain entrances

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
to certain systems, to
basically, plunder and steal.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Is that really
happening out there?

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if we're
going down the list.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We cover mercenaries, pirates,
and then crime syndicates.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And mobster-style
organizations, which certainly,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:90%
are also out there.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So, again, this comes down
to an issue of policing.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
areas of space which

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:84%
are heavily regulated
and policed,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:90%
you have less criminal activity.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
In areas where it's a
little iffy, you have,

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
again, syndicates
of organized ships

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that have enough
muscle to say, oh, this

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is a dangerous place
for space pirates.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll escort your cargo
from point A to point B.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
And it will only
cost you this much.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't pay, then
our friends, the pirates,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
will steal your stuff and
then we'll get it anyway.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Or then we'll charge
you to go get your stuff

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:90%
and bring it back to you.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get you
a portion of it

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:90%
for a certain amount of money.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll still
get to keep them out.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when there's areas that
are less regulated and less

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
policed, then you
have crime syndicates

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
who recognize that
there's huge profits

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to be made in piracy
and protection

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and all of the other things--

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:90%
contraband.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
There are systems that forbid
certain trading materials.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
That forbid certain
chemical substances.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So what other species
are involved with this?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're talking about
pirates and crime syndicates,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
it can be a real
interesting hodgepodge.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking
about these larger

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
groups of bad
actors, again, you've

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:90%
got Draconians, Zeta Reticulins.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Some hostile, aggressive,
carnivorous insectoid species.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So it is rare, but we do
have a few really hostile

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:90%
insectoid species out there.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>> You mentioned the Zetas.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I know there's many species.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And what is their
function out there

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in this hodgepodge of
diabolical take over?

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The Zetas themselves tend
to work for other species.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But also working for
themselves at the same time,

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
while working for
those other species.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So they'll take a job
with another species

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:90%
to manage a system.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to
do some other things

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that they want to do that will
benefit their own interest

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:90%
in that system.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:84%
You have the general
characteristics

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
that people are familiar
with, which is the big head.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:90%
The big round eyes.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
The body type is where
we see some variation.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So what people are used to
seeing in artistic or media

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
representation is
this small-bodied Zeta

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:90%
with the big head.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
That's typical of the scientist
caste or the piloting caste.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But the warrior caste
which they have,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:90%
physically are much larger.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:90%
They can be much taller.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:90%
They can be quite a bit beefier.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And their heads can
be quite a bit larger.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
The way that we usually identify
the different subcategories

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Reticulins is
often by skin color.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a
racial distinction.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of colors?

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, people often
refer to the Grays,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:90%
but they're not gray.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
They're actually,
more of an off-white.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So we internally refer
to them as whites.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Turns out, there's also
a dark, dark purple.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a couple
of off-brown colors.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Kind of, a coppery brown color.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:90%
There's a muddy brown color.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And there's even a green color--

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
dark forest green.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So there are a few
different colors.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And they come in
some different sizes,

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
their job in the caste

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
or in that particular
subspecies is.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Can that species
intermingle and produce?

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> They can, for the most part.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
They're so genetically
similar that they

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:90%
do have genetic compatibility.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the traits
of the Reticulins,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:84%
though, is that
because they have

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:84%
done their own genetic
augmentation for so long,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
they stopped reproducing
biologically.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So most of them, if they
have any left over genitalia,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:90%
they're not functional.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:90%
They're impotent.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how many of them
are actually physically capable

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
of biological
reproduction since they

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
have been using artificial
biological reproduction

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.433 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory for so long.

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one
of the problems

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
having to work out.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And why they want
to make hybrids

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
so that they can regain some of
the things that they have lost.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But they are technically
genetically compatible.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And who's in charge
with that species?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Saying, OK, we're going to grow
a few thousand of us this year.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
How do they increase
their numbers?

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And who's in charge of
that, in that species?

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> They run off some different
authoritarian systems.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So they have a pretty
strict hierarchy.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And the beings that are at the
top are very much in charge

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.193 align:middle line:84%
and very much dictate everything
that's happening below them.

00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that has
to do with the way

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that they are
genetically engineered.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Their brains, their cranium
size that gives them

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
greater psionic ability,
greater intellectual capacity

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:90%
than their lower drone subjects.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So there are upper echelons
within each organization,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
but they have different
authoritarian structures.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So they're not exactly the same.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say that
they're, very simply,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:90%
tiny number at the top.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.515 align:middle line:90%
Larger numbers at the bottom.

00:13:30.515 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And, pretty much,
everything that

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
happens below the
top of the pyramid

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is decided by the
top of the pyramid.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> How old can they live for?

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands of years,
my understanding.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Their lifespan
biologically is somewhere

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
between about 1,500
and 3,000 years.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And with, obviously,
artificial cellular

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
regeneration, they can maintain
their lifespans longer.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
But I understand
their natural lifespan

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.250 align:middle line:90%
is a couple of thousand years.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> What about these insectoids?

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So let me talk for a second
about insects here on planet

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Earth, especially ant species.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
correlation here.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So ant species on
planet Earth are

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
mostly, nonviolently, hostilely,
carnivorously aggressive.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
You have ant species
that act, essentially,

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
as agriculturalists
who will take out

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
every plant within a
certain radius of the hive,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:90%
except for one or two plants.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And then harvest
those like farmers.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
You have ants that
use little aphids

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:90%
like as a herding animal.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.512 align:middle line:84%
And they carry them
out of the hive.

00:14:36.512 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Put them on the leaves.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And the little aphids
eat the leaves.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they milk
glucagon off of the aphid

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:90%
and eat the glucagon.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they're functioning
as a herding animal like cows.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:84%
You have an interesting
wide variety

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of the way in which ant
species terrestrially function.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:90%
But you do have driver ants.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Driver ants are
incredibly hostile.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:90%
They are carnivorous.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:90%
They will eat anything.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
They have been known to
take down tethered horses,

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:90%
unattended infants.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Anything that they can
get their pincers on.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And will take them apart
one little piece at a time

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and devour them.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
insectoid species

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
in the intergalactic community,
there's a similar pattern.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Which is most of the
species that we run into

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:90%
can be defensive.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Can be very fierce
in a defensive way

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
if you're territorially
next to them

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
or attacking them
or threatening them.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Like many of the ant
species that we have here

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
will come rushing out of their
hive and bite you and say, hey.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Get the heck away from me.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:10%
But you don't have too many
hyper-aggressive carnivorous

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:10%
species.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> How large are these beings?

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The species that
we're the most familiar--

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.660 align:middle line:84%
becoming the most familiar
with at the moment,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
they probably stand somewhere
between about 7 and 8 feet

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:90%
tall.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty big.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Bipedal?

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>> They walk on four and
use their two upper arms

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:90%
as manipulative digits.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:07.855 align:middle line:90%
So they're pretty big.

00:16:07.855 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty scary.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Big mandibles.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Carnivorous.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So they will bite
off a person's head.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Eat people.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Tear people apart.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Use humans or other biological
animals as food source

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:84%
or other species
as a food source.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that they're
very similar to driver

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
ants in the sense that
they're relentlessly

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:90%
aggressive and hostile.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And will do their
best that they can

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to consume whatever
biological physiological

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
resources that they need
when they come into a system

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:90%
that they've decided to target.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I've heard many stories
and interviewed many people

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:84%
about what had happened
near Crestone, Colorado,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:84%
where they sent the Marines in
to gas out this group of ant

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:90%
And it turned horribly wrong.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Marines actually
tried to put the gas in there

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:90%
and came back out.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
infected and they

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
had to call civilian helicopters
in to rescue these people.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
It was a covert operation to
drive them out and kill them.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
In the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, I think it's called.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sangre de
Cristo Mountains.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:84%
What could you tell me
about-- is that these beings?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a different
race here on Earth?

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:10%
>> My understanding was that
this was a visiting insectoid

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:10%
species.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It was not the terrestrial
insectoid species.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
That they were exhibiting
unfriendly characteristics

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
that we deemed was
necessary to want to evict

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:90%
from this particular territory.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
As this is also an
area in which there

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
are underground military
bases functioning.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So it was determined
that this is

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:90%
an outside insectoid species.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:90%
They're not cooperating.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:90%
They're not friendly.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
They're too close to
military installations.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can't gas
them out and get rid of them.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And yes, apparently
from what I understand,

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:90%
it did go very badly.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.435 align:middle line:84%
>> And that Colorado Great
Sand Dunes, is that part of--

00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
was that formed
from anything to do

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
with the insectoids thousands of
years ago or millions of years

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:90%
ago?

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that, that had
something to do with tunneling

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:90%
excavation.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Which, if you've ever seen
ants excavate out a tunnel,

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.422 align:middle line:84%
they take all these
little grains of sand,

00:18:25.422 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and push them out, and
make these little mounds

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:90%
on the ground as they excavate.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding
is it's likely

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
that was from
excavation of tunnels

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:90%
that was just pushed out.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.845 align:middle line:84%
>> From like an ancient
ant civilization.

00:18:36.845 --> 00:18:37.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Thousands of years ago.

00:18:37.928 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Thousands-- at
least of years ago.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why, maybe, they
returned to Mount Blanca Peak

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's a hive that was
emptied out some long time ago,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
it becomes an attractive space
to another insectoid species

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:90%
or another hive settling group.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:02.847 align:middle line:84%
In the same way if a
hive of ants left a hive

00:19:02.847 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and decided to move somewhere
else and, all of a sudden,

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
you've got this
empty tunnel system,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.838 align:middle line:84%
could become attractive to
another species of ant nearby.

00:19:09.838 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And could say, hey, look.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
We've already got this tunnel
system that's already dug in.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's move in.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.312 align:middle line:84%
Same thing could happen in
this situation, where you've

00:19:17.312 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
got a much larger
tunnel system that

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle line:84%
was built by a previous
insectoid species that was then

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:90%
vacated for whatever reason.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you have another
species of insectoid

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:90%
comes along and goes, oh, look.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.155 align:middle line:84%
A perfectly good
tunneled out system

00:19:30.155 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:90%
that we can just move into.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.155 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to dig.

00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to excavate.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to them
being muscular and strong,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:90%
do they have psionic abilities?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Do they have any other
special abilities?

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Mind control or
anything like that?

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>> They have some
psionic abilities.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that their
offensive psionic abilities

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
are strong.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like they have
strong telekinesis, strong mind

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:84%
control, strong ability
to manipulate matter

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:90%
and energy with their minds.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But they do have the ability to
communicate, read minds, read

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
people telepathically, read
psionically, communicate

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:90%
psionically.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So they have a rudimentary
psionic ability based

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
on their evolutionary need.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason, they
haven't, what I would say,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
evolved towards psionic
offensive ability.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not something
that they've moved towards.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
They still seem
to prefer numbers.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Lots of attacking
soldier drones.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What is their main function
and concern in the universe?

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's their purpose?

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Do they like to mine?

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Do they like to cultivate?

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Do they like to inhabit
worlds and take over?

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Do they have any agenda?

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So my understanding is the
worlds that they primarily

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:84%
occupy have been drained
of mineral resources,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:90%
water resources.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:90%
They're fairly consumptive.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And they have no problem in
making a hive here, making

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:84%
a hive here, making a hive here,
and becoming very dense, as

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
far as how they
occupy certain space.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.748 align:middle line:84%
And as they've done that, not
unlike the way in which we have

00:21:23.748 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
done that here on
planet Earth, is we

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:84%
have had more and more people
occupying more dense space.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:90%
We consume more.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they consume
more minerals.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%
They consume more water.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:90%
They consume more food.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
They are interested in having a
complex functional space fleet.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
That means that they have to
have industrial technology.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
That means they have to
convert minerals to materials.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Materials to vehicles
and technology

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that requires a tremendous
amount of resource.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So the hive intelligence
is willing to sacrifice

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
any part of its lesser
self to achieve its goal.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So their way of becoming
space-faring attackers

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:90%
follows that model.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
They are willing to make massive
space fleets that they are

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%
willing to throw at the wall.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And they don't care how
many ships they lose.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't care how
many soldiers they lose.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:90%
That's not the point.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:84%
The point is to have
a lot of everything.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Throw a lot of
something at a problem.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And overwhelm that
system with more ships,

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
more bodies without any
care OR consideration

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.890 align:middle line:90%
how much you lose.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.508 align:middle line:84%
And if that's your attitude,
then your overall model

00:22:44.508 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:84%
is going to be one
where you're going

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
to need to be producing
or taking more minerals,

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
making more
materials so that you

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.250 align:middle line:84%
can replenish the drones and
the ships that you're losing.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, they're
kind of wasteful.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And being as wasteful as they
are, they need more resources.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So they're mostly looking for
planetary systems that have

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:90%
the minerals that they need.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Food source that they need.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Water that they need.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So that they can continue
to feed, water, and provide

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:84%
minerals to the
civilized over really

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
populated densified civilized
structures that they have,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
whose only goal is to make
more ships, more soldiers,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:90%
and acquire more materials.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you come across a
species that's not carbon-based

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:90%
or bipedal?

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Certainly a species
that's not carbon-based.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And certainly some
that are not bipedal.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the species
that we run into,

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
for interesting reasons
that I think we're still

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out,
what some people call

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the star-shaped model--
two arms, two legs,

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.050 align:middle line:84%
with the head on top--
it is very common.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's very common.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But we do experience
some other species

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:90%
who have more appendages.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And, again, not just
insectoid species.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But higher mammalian
species that

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:84%
have more legs or
more arms, which can

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.620 align:middle line:90%
be a little weird and strange.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:90%
But that happens.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen
mineral-based species

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:90%
who are like silicone-based.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're essentially, made
of a mineral content, which

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:90%
also has a water content to it.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So think of a crystal
that you could

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.060 align:middle line:84%
hold in your hand that holds
a certain amount of moisture

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
in it so that it's
mineral-based.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a crystalline structure.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:10%
But--

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.600 align:middle line:10%
>> It's malleable.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Squishy.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> So yeah.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think of a crystal
that would be squishy,

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:84%
but still made of a crystalline
structure because it has

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:90%
fluid into it, of some kind.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of mineral fluid
or hydrostatic content to it.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are
conscious beings?

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:84%
The ones that I've encountered
also bipedal, as it turns.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Out.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So they got the two
arms, two legs, head.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they're made
of complete silicone,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:90%
crystalline mineral structure.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> How large are they?

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The ones that I have
seen are, what I would say,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.150 align:middle line:90%
is within human scope.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So kind of between the
5 to 6 feet tall-ish.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So about the same
size as we are.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they have eyes,
and ears, and mouth?

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They eat food.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Not the same kind of
food we obviously eat.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:34.090 align:middle line:84%
They eat other mostly
mineral content.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But, again, mineral
content that has a water

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
content of some kind
or oily minerals

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:84%
of some kind that are the stuff
that their bodies run off of.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:84%
They have very different
biological structures as far

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:84%
as internal organs
and processes.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But also similar, from
what I understand.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:90%
So they have a biological brain.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
They have biological
fluid pumping systems.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But instead of the
cellular structure

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
being based on carbon,
they're based on silicone.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
In a very similar way,
the biological life

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
that's carbon-based operates,
but it's also really unique

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%
that it's being evolved out of
this silicon-based structure.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these bad actors
in conflict with humans?

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Wherever we run into them and
that they don't feel like they

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
want to play nice
and cooperate, yeah.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:90%
We're in conflict with them.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Other species are in
conflict with them.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And you dealt with this
in a combat situation,

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:90%
with some these.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Some the them, yes.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And which ones
can you divulge?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Which species that you
were in conflict with?

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I've certainly encountered
plasmid mercenaries.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
We've encountered
Zeta Reticulins.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I've encountered Draconians.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
We've encountered a few other
low level aggressive species,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
which aren't a
threat to us, per se,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
but that we've had to
deal with as aggressors

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to other friends of ours that
we stepped in to assist with.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this happening
today, Randy?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Is this still going on?

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:07.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:07.665 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Right this very minute.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, can you give me an
example of this going on today?

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
We've been receiving
some intelligence

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that we have become
a target of interest

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:90%
for these aggressive insectoids.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
We think that there
is a reasonable chance

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that we might see them here in
our own system sometime soon.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually coming to Earth
or just making their presence

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:90%
known in our system?

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe from
the intelligence that

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
we're receiving, we would see
them make landfall on planet

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And how does that look
for us for the future?

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an alien invasion.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the best way to
combat these insectoids?

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably with some of the
technology that we've been

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:90%
using already.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So hydraulically-operated
battle suits, plasma rifles,

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Gauss rifles.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:84%
You want something that has
higher penetration power as far

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:84%
as a projectile or something
that has a higher melting

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:90%
point, like a plasma ball.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So against the
exoskeletons, which

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:84%
are very resilient and most lead
bullets would just bounce off.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had worked on some
of these insectoids before

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:90%
in the projects.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And their exoskeletons, some of
them were like 3 inches thick.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And bulletproof for
our normal bullets.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were using
special heat rounds.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Do you know about this?

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:84%
They're definitely--
the thick exoskeletons

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
are what we call, sort of,
nigh bulletproof or near

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:90%
bulletproof.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Which doesn't mean that you
can't get a Sable around

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:84%
from a .50 caliber
rifle through one.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.820 align:middle line:90%
You can, sometimes.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But for most of what we consider
our standard projectiles

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.490 align:middle line:84%
that we fire out of rifles
or smaller caliber machine

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
guns, handheld machine
guns, and rifles, yeah.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get the
penetration that you need.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So you either need a different
alloy or a phosphorus round

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:84%
or a rifle that heats up the
round before it goes out.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Or, again, a plasma
rifle so that you're

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.590 align:middle line:84%
getting that thousands
of degrees ball of plasma

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:90%
that melts right through.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there an agenda that
you can share with us?

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And are they already
preparing in space something

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to, maybe, block them from
entering our atmosphere?

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So let me give a little bit
of military history 101 here.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So any time you have a level
of military technology--

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can go all the way
back to catapults and crossbows

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and metal armor,
to anything that's

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:84%
way more advanced-- any time
that you have a situation where

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:84%
someone has certain technology,
it's good at that time.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You do the best that
you can with it.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But nothing's ever, usually,
perfect, impenetrable,

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.670 align:middle line:90%
unbeatable.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So whatever technology that we
have in operation right now,

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:90%
it's good.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:90%
It's really good.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't mean that it's perfect.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that we can prevent
any attack from getting close.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that we
can prevent all of them.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.057 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that we can
prevent every single ship.

00:30:23.057 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's really going to
depend on some numbers.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:84%
How many ships are
they going to bring?

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:90%
How many ships do we have?

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
How many ships do
we have dedicated

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:34.820 align:middle line:84%
to any other necessary projects
that we have them dedicated to?

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Or how many ships
do we have dedicated

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to other military
operations that

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
would be problematic
to simply pull from?

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
deal with what we've got.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to use
the best of what we have.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.647 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use the
best tactics that we have.

00:30:49.647 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use everything
that we have been learning

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:84%
as a defensive and offensive
space-faring military species

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:90%
now-- which we are.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But in no way, shape, or form
should we expect perfection out

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.160 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Especially with a species
that has got some experience

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:90%
at being hostile.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, what other intel can
you share with us about this

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:90%
insectoid invasion on Earth?

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are certain
senior military officials who

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.850 align:middle line:84%
may not be thrilled about
the idea of facing a hostile

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.610 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
force on planet Earth.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
There are also
those who understand

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that if we don't come
to a disclosure event,

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.110 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
in bigger trouble

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
than if we do have
a disclosure of it.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems we
may be having with that

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:90%
is getting people to agree.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So if some senior
military personnel

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:84%
were to see the potential
for an invasion,

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.180 align:middle line:84%
that might be the
very opportunity

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that they would need to get
a forced disclosure event.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So not unlike Pearl
Harbor, where someone maybe

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.910 align:middle line:84%
knows that something's
coming and they kind of just

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:84%
let it slip through
the cracks anyway,

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:84%
because they feel like they
need to based on a larger

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:90%
military agenda.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> This could seriously dissolve
the human population quickly.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Or bring us
together very quickly.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone looking around at
what's happening in the world,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:90%
we're at each other's throats.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And might just be
the perfect time

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:84%
to come together for fighting
against the hostile exterior

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of the
secret space force heading out

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and heading them off
before they get here?

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I would think that there's
going to be some of that

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of that, again, is
going to depend on numbers.

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:49.560 align:middle line:84%
When we actually see an
approaching set of ships coming

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:84%
our way, then we
can do some math

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and decide whether you want to
send anything to meet them out.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Try and soften them up
before they get close.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Or whether you're just going to
stand back in the best defense

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.500 align:middle line:84%
that you have and wait
for the first impact

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:90%
and then deal with it.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they have fighter ships?

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> They do.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But mostly what
they do is landers.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So they will have big ships
that have smaller ships.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And in those landers will
have lots of soldier drones.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And the landers will drop off.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're giant bugs.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So they like to do things
like giant bugs do,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.750 align:middle line:84%
which is get on the
ground and overwhelm.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any
extraterrestrial allies with

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:84%
the humans that would maybe step
it up and help us combat these

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:90%
insectoids?

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, the minutia
of that is debate.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say we
have the potential of--

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll simplify the numbers--

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
let's say we have 10 friends
that might be able to help out.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Might be willing to
come to our assistance.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to ask,
again, minutia questions,

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.380 align:middle line:84%
like, how many soldiers,
ships, and personnel

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.650 align:middle line:90%
can that species lend to us?

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:84%
How much can they
afford to, say,

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.870 align:middle line:84%
based on whatever
other interactions

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.239 align:middle line:84%
that they're having
in their own space

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
or in other areas where
they're dedicating personnel

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and military hardware.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:90%
So how much can they give us?

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.670 align:middle line:90%
What's it going to cost?

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.037 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's necessarily got a
specific price tag that's like,

00:34:27.037 --> 00:34:28.620 align:middle line:84%
well, it's going to
cost us this much.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.969 align:middle line:90%
You have to pay us this much.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:34.739 align:middle line:84%
It may be more like let's
renegotiate this trade contract

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.889 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll be happy
to jump in and throw

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:84%
this many carriers, destroyers,
thousands of personnel

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.110 align:middle line:90%
to assist the process.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So there is just some
discussion over what's

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.701 align:middle line:84%
an acceptable agreement to them,
that we can agree to that they

00:34:50.701 --> 00:34:51.659 align:middle line:90%
can be willing to help.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.425 align:middle line:84%
Which is the same
kind of a discussion

00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that someone would
have with us if they

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:90%
wanted us to come help them.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, here's
what we can dedicate.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
If we, maybe, shift the trade
contract, we can do this.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Dedicate for X amount
of weeks, months, years,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:07.980 align:middle line:90%
this much personnel.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So as they say, the
devil's in the details.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have friends,
but there's going

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to be some discussion over
who can show up with how much.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think about the
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of and you're
aware of that are living

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.020 align:middle line:84%
in the oceans and
the inner Earth.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to respond
to this surface battle?

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
the Reptilians are

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:90%
going to come out and assist?

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.395 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the Aquafarians
are going to come out?

00:35:33.395 --> 00:35:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And what's your take on that?

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That's going to depend
on some different factors.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So depending on just how good
are negotiations right now

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.620 align:middle line:84%
are with those other
terrestrial species will depend.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that some of
their attitude for a long time

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:84%
has been surface
world's your problem.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, if they're attacking major
cities on the surface world,

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.280 align:middle line:90%
it's not our problem.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:84%
If they're not
coming underground,

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.640 align:middle line:84%
if they're not coming
into the ocean,

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.890 align:middle line:84%
well, they're not
threatening us personally.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're not sure
whether we want

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to get involved and poke
that monster in the eye.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And get them to start attacking
us if they're not attacking us.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So they will have
to ask themselves

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
the question of what it's
worth to them or worth the risk

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:90%
to get involved.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Or whether it's
just, a viable option

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to give us some technology,
give us some ships,

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:84%
give us some soldiers, give
us some tech that we can use.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Or whether they would
really get involved

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.782 align:middle line:84%
with their own
military apparatus.

00:36:34.782 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
interesting questions

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.365 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think we have
the answer to right now,

00:36:38.365 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
find out soon enough.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I was privy to some
documentation that did show

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.975 align:middle line:84%
that there was communication
with the inner Earth

00:36:45.975 --> 00:36:47.850 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials and
other extraterrestrials

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And because we've been so
negligent to the surface

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and the
oceans, they actually

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.630 align:middle line:84%
are, kind of, like,
well, if something

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
were to happen, maybe that'll
just help clean up the surface.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Because these humans are
not respecting Gaia--

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Mother Earth.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're poisoning
some of their--

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.930 align:middle line:90%
we're poisoning the land.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:84%
We're poisoning
underneath the land.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:90%
We're poisoning the water.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And they use this stuff
for survival down there.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.242 align:middle line:84%
So there also might
be an agenda we're

00:37:19.242 --> 00:37:21.700 align:middle line:84%
let them just clean it up so
we don't have to deal with it.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll take over later.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I would suggest based on the
information that I have also

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.140 align:middle line:84%
heard that we have a,
let's just call it,

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.680 align:middle line:84%
a positive friendly
relationship with these folks.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:90%
But you're correct.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:84%
They might look at the
situation and go, well,

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
If you get down to
3 billion people

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and you still haven't
sorted it out,

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe we'll jump in and
help you at that point.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.080 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.093 align:middle line:84%
We think you probably
got too many people.

00:37:50.093 --> 00:37:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're making
too much garbage

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.258 align:middle line:84%
and you're making
too much pollution.

00:37:54.258 --> 00:37:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you guys
would be better off

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.675 align:middle line:90%
without a few people.

00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we don't need
to jump in and help

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.560 align:middle line:84%
right now because
this could all just

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.200 align:middle line:84%
work for the benefit and
the health and well-being

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.920 align:middle line:90%
of the planet overall.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Which some people may think of
as a less than compassionate

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:84%
attitude, but it's a
big picture attitude.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a survival.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If the big picture is
survival of the entire planet

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and not just one
group or species,

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.580 align:middle line:84%
then that's a viable
way of looking at it.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:27.410 align:middle line:84%
As Ronald Reagan said, if
we had an alien threat, how

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.740 align:middle line:84%
all of our differences
would just come to an end

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and work together.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that the social
psychological assessment

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
of the varying social
psychological demographics

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:84%
indicate that
that's very likely.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.020 align:middle line:84%
That with the presence
of a hostile threat

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.340 align:middle line:84%
from outside that,
more than not,

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:84%
people will come together
and work together

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.690 align:middle line:90%
for a common goal.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Randy, an amazing story.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the show.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.965 align:middle line:84%
It's always my
pleasure to be here.

00:38:55.965 --> 00:38:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith and this
is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
