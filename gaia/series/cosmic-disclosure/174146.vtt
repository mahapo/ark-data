00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: All right,
welcome back to "Cosmic

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.490 align:middle line:10%
Disclosure".

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm here with our special
guest, Emery Smith.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the previous episode,
we were talking about some

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
of these genetic
programs that you

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
were involved with in which
extraterrestrial DNA was

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:90%
being blended with human DNA.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into some
very strange things.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And you had mentioned hybrids.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY SMITH: Right.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So hybrid beings
might have qualities that are

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.802 align:middle line:84%
different from regular
humans, as you said.

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right, right.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:10%
Humanoid extraterrestrials
are similar to us

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:10%
and similar to our DNA.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a great match
to make a hybrid.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they
might have other abilities

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have like
exceptional hearing, smell,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.422 align:middle line:90%
taste.

00:01:11.422 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
All the senses might be a little
bit different or elevated,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.836 align:middle line:84%
especially their neurological
system and their brains.

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:90%
But they're all compatible.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But during a lot of
the hybrid testing,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.464 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like it
just was that easy.

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
They made a lot of mistakes.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of mutations.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And during the mutations,
they thought that was good.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they would come
out a little bit different,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
such as reduced cognitive
function and a very short fuse,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:90%
we'll say.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
They became angry,
some of the hybrids.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So they made an entire
different program

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
based on making sure
they could mutate them.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was a different
project, a different location

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that was
also run by the same MILABs.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So they took the
mutation of these genes,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
of all these mutated creatures,
and then started mutating them

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:90%
even more, more, more, more.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they became so mutated
that the cells were actually

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:90%
dying too quickly.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to add proteins

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to them to re-animate the body,
even though it was brain dead.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So this is similar
to the concept of a zombie.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Exactly, yeah.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So I have heard from
others before you and I ever

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
talked about this about
the zombie program.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And Corey Goode independently
said that he was aware of it.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
He might not have
thought that it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
was as prevalent as some of
the stuff that you've told me.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But again, nobody really has
access to all the compartments.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
this a little bit.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I guess to frame the
discussion, first of all,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember some
of the people working

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
in this black ops world are
straight ahead satanic cabal.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Were you made aware
of certain groups that had

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
a depopulation
agenda, for example?

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And what was their
reasoning behind wanting

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the
earth's population?

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
What was the excuse
that they would use?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Control.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's getting too out of
control for them to control.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
There's too many people
for them to control.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So by
lowering the population,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
they could create the
new world order concept?

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Correct.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:84%
With people that have that
kind of psychopathic cultish

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:84%
background, why would
they see this as useful?

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:90%
What would be the agenda here?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.173 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, they made it
look like they could use it

00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
for maybe war or something,
dropping in some psychopathic

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
hybrids in an area and
killing a bunch of people.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But it actually became more
ego-oriented with the cabal.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is they
were funding a lot of money

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:90%
into these underground--

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
amazing underground
facilities that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
were growing all sorts
of hideous things,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:90%
mixing all sorts of hybrid DNA.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget this
is all because we

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
were mixing ET DNA with human
DNA and not doing it-- maybe

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
it's just at the
right temperature.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And things would happen.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
They would mutate into
very different things

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
because it does have
to be just right.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.859 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Now, most people who
are familiar with traditional

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
ufology are going to be
thinking Dulce, New Mexico.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
gotten confirmation

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of
stuff being in Dulce?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually I've heard them storing
a few of these beings there.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:90%
A few meaning a few hundred.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But actually it was
at a separate facility

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:90%
not in North America.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:84%
That is the
underground facility.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And mainly for safety,
because if something

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
were to break out, such
as a virus or something,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want it
to be here first, even

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:90%
though the funders live here.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And the corporations
are based out

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:90%
of the United States of America.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: In a previous
episode, you mentioned some sort

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of weird bear human hybrid
breaking out and causing a lot

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:90%
of damage.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Is that different from what
we're talking about now?

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Or is this a similar
type of idea?

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It's different.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
They were really trying to
make a type of hybrid animal

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't have
human DNA in it.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It was more animalistic
and programmable.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was more geared up for,
like, the osseointegration

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
projects in the early, early
years of making a super warrior

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
animal that could
assist the troops

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
or at least just be
dropped in a zone

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and destroy everything
before it was killed.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So these hybrids
that we're talking about now,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:90%
they have extraterrestrial DNA.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.884 align:middle line:84%
But would they look
extraterrestrial?

00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They may or may not,
depending on the percentage

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
of DNA that they
have that is human.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they have to
have a pretty close

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
match, number one,
for it to work.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
mutation happens.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
When you push the envelope of
percentages of human genomes

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and interacting
with making a human

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.609 align:middle line:84%
from two different
types of genes,

00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:90%
it can get really tricky.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why they had
all these mutations.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But then, the more human
extraterrestrial DNA

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
they got that was more
similar to humans,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
using humanoid extraterrestrial,
then they've perfected it.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:90%
So it would be OK.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So what were some of
the extraterrestrial genetic

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
components that advanced these
hybrids over what we would

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:90%
normally be like?

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.619 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the
special features, let's say?

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, it could
be anything from height,

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
higher metabolism, that you
didn't have to eat as much,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
eyesight would be
amazingly increased, taste.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
All the senses are
usually enhanced.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing was cognitive function

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and also having a better
awareness than a normal human.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So they were more aware
than a normal human.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And they also had
higher IQs than humans.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: When we're dealing
with these malevolent hybrids,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
these zombie humanoids, what
aspect of extraterrestrial

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:90%
genetics was added?

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And how did that affect them?

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: What happens is when
they're making hybridisation,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.680 align:middle line:90%
many things can go wrong.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it could be just
a small temperature thing when

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:90%
they're growing these beings.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And once they start
mutating, then you've

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.827 align:middle line:84%
basically lost the
entire project.

00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Once a cell starts
mutating, then it's

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:90%
not going to come out perfect.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be very different
as far as cognitive function.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they'll
add chemicals and amino acids

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:90%
and peptides and hormones.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And they'll try to regulate it.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't go well,
they still let it grow.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they take that
genetic DNA from this,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and then they take it over to
that place, that other MILAB.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And they usually shipped the
whole being and everything.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And then it's stored
there for those scientists

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:90%
to make it even worse.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.460 align:middle line:90%
They may add animal DNA to it.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
They may try to make a
disgusting creature or being.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said
it was ego-related

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:84%
because it is being funded, but
it wasn't performing anything.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:90%
There was no performance factor.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.831 align:middle line:84%
We always had performance
factors for all of our MILABs.

00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
If you don't meet your
performance factor,

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
your whole project
gets shut down.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And that might mean
just meeting a quota.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Or it might mean collecting
more ETs or beings or whatever.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to
what you just said,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with when
we're growing these beings,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:84%
if they're going to
come out good or not

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
all depends on the environment
and if the DNA is a match

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And if not, then they would
genetically, and using

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, try to
trick the DNA to making

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:90%
it think it's a match.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So if we're having
a program that doesn't really

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
have a desirable outcome
right off the bat,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
there's no immediate benefit,
with these psychopathic cabal

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
people, they're looking
at it in a different way.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking at it as a
weapon system of some kind?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Kind of a fear factor
de-popularization factor.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
They could easily introduce
a couple of these beings.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
They might go into a
city, carry a virus,

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and easily transmit
this virus to a human.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And that human would
mutate as well.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, not instantaneously,
but pretty quickly.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: It would appear, then,
that the media has already been

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
greatly telegraphing
something like this.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.587 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
a lot of movies.

00:10:08.587 --> 00:10:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of television
shows like "The Walking Dead".

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Oh, right.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.634 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Even the
second "Maze Runner"

00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:10%
movie turns out
to all be zombies.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:10%
So it's as if they're
telegraphing something

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.257 align:middle line:10%
that they know they already
have to generate more fear.

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Would you say that's true?

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes,
that's exactly true.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe
though, even though they

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
may have thousands and thousands
of these beings ready to go

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
or doing what they want to do,
however they're utilizing it,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
setting up centers to do mock
infections, underground cities

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, and using real
people for that and clones

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and programmed life form
clones to be utilized

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:84%
in these mass releases
of these creatures

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
into a population to
see what would happen.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You're
saying simulations.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Simulations, yeah.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's more for
the enjoyment of the cabal,

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:90%
to be honest.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I do not believe that
the extraterrestrials would

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.094 align:middle line:84%
ever let something
like that happen.

00:11:10.094 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And I also don't believe
the Alliance is going

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:90%
to let that happen either.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, it's interesting
because I have another high

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
level insider that gave me a lot
of information about the zombie

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there
have been multiple times

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that the cabal thought
they were going

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to release some of these
creatures into our society.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
angelic intervention.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
They would have benevolent
ETs, light being type

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:84%
ETs, the really
advanced ones, that

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
would completely stop anything
like that from happening.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what he said was
that they ultimately

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
had to scrap enormous programs
that they thought they were

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to use because
no matter how they tried,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:84%
no matter which way they
tried to flip it around,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
they just couldn't
get it authorized.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:84%
It's always about
authorization for them.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.870 align:middle line:90%
So would you feel that's true?

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.935 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I would
say that's very accurate.

00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Let's talk a little
bit about these simulations

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
because what you're describing
now is something you and I have

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:90%
talked about quite a bit.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And it is disturbing.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's important to
get a little bit deeper into it

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:90%
than you did.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Paint the picture
now for what would

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
happen in a particular
underground facility

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
if they were going
to make a simulation.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
What would we see just
as the chessboard?

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It would be like a
Hollywood production studio set

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:84%
up where they would take a
center of maybe Miami or just

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
a city anywhere and then mimic
a few blocks of that in an area.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And then cloned humans
that they would just

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.096 align:middle line:84%
wake up already programmed
with something in their head,

00:12:55.096 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
like they think they lived there
their whole lives or whatever.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And they
wouldn't realize they were

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:90%
in an underground base at all?

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They would
not even realize that

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to be
dead in 10 minutes or infected.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because you have to
remember this has to do with

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:90%
de-population programming.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So what they want to know with
these simulations is one thing.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
How fast can we get
this virus to spread?

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.244 align:middle line:84%
And how are the
people going to react?

00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:22.618 align:middle line:84%
And how many of them are going
to fight back and how many

00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:90%
won't?

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And who are they going to call?

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Who are they calling?

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So they're very smart
about what things to look for.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's just a
big chess game for them.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
a big fantasy game.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe-- but billions
and billions of dollars

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
are put into these little
chess game projects.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: How would a
particular simulation come

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:90%
to a conclusion?

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
How long does it run, and
how do they conclude it?

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They conclude it
when all the humans are dead

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:90%
and the virus has spread.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: So you and I have
talked about the "Resident

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.814 align:middle line:10%
Evil" movie series.

00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Right, yeah.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: And we've watched
some of them together.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Sure.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.714 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So how does
"Resident Evil" play into this?

00:14:06.714 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
large movie series.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.755 align:middle line:84%
There's like nine of
them or something.

00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well,
you have the cabal.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.592 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a perfect
description of a cabal.

00:14:13.592 --> 00:14:15.425 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: There's this
umbrella corporation.

00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You have this
corporation umbrella.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And they basically were
a regenerative medicine

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
corporation, if you
read actually the story

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:90%
book of whoever wrote it.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.146 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
doing is trying

00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate cells
for face creams.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great
storyline because a lot

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
of these big pharma
corporations are behind it--

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these things.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So this medicine actually
went bad and started actually

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:90%
destroying the skin cells.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.601 align:middle line:84%
But it also re-animated
them at the same time.

00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:45.476 align:middle line:90%
So it was really new.

00:14:45.476 --> 00:14:48.064 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like destroying,
dying, killing, dying.

00:14:48.064 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you want to
kill your skin cells

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:90%
that grow back faster.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:90%
So it was a great concept.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.849 align:middle line:10%
And the thing was they had
an underground base somewhere

00:14:55.849 --> 00:14:58.265 align:middle line:10%
in the United States of America,
which was very realistic.

00:14:58.265 --> 00:14:58.995 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: In the movie.

00:14:58.995 --> 00:15:01.036 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: In the movie,
which was very realistic.

00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: And that's
the hive, right?

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Yeah, the hive.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.514 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: And I couldn't believe
they actually show schematics.

00:15:06.514 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:10%
Because there's many bases
that have this hive looking

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.277 align:middle line:10%
type base on that movie.

00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: So it's
very, very accurate.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Very accurate.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: One of the things that
I thought was so weird about

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.485 align:middle line:84%
this movie, first of
all, the "Resident Evil"

00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:84%
movies are all
basically zombie films.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much zombies
show up in every movie.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: So you go in.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
You have this Templar
type of symbol

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:90%
for Umbrella Corporation.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
They show you this
over and over again.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
this underground city.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I found really weird,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Emery, was the number
of props, the number

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
of details, the amount of
sets that seemed overkill.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:90%
You don't need that much detail.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And so how did the
scenes in the movie

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.055 align:middle line:84%
equate with what you
actually knew to be true?

00:15:52.055 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It was probably one of
the most realistic sets

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen in my life.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
shocked the first time

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I saw it because I could not
believe they would show people

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:84%
such detail of security, detail
of how the lab is set up.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:10%
Even the props were real props--

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:10%
the vacuum closed system
rooms, the overhead

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:10%
hoods with the gloves and
using the special boxes

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:10%
to keep the viruses in.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Especially what
got me was the dogs

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that they use for being
aware of certain chemicals.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
That all the viruses in
these vats, if you break one,

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
has a special chemical in it
that the computer knows its

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:90%
in the air system.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And then dogs start barking,
alarms start going off.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So it was very accurate,
especially utilizing

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:90%
an underground base.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Having a secret entrance a
couple miles away from the base

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:90%
is very popular.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Having two agents that
play husband and wife

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:90%
is very popular.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.041 align:middle line:84%
You might have someone
living right next door,

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's really an entrance
to a base in a suburbia.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:90%
And you wouldn't even know it.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
interesting story line.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And everything in there was
very accurate, as far as the AI

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
They use a lot of AI now for
running the base because they

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.822 align:middle line:90%
don't trust humans.

00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: And there's also
these sort of boss enemies

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:24.619 align:middle line:10%
in the movie, these weird hybrid
grotesque beings that are not

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:10%
just the typical
zombies, but like--

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Oh, right.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect
description of the mutated

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials and humans.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So they can get up very
large, these beings, and very

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:84%
grotesque looking, and only
have one thing on their mind.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And they do mind control
on those beings too

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and program them
to go to this place

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and kill this or
destroy everything.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So they have the ability because
they have the cerebral cortex

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:90%
still working.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Let's talk a little
bit about what are some

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
of the countermeasures
that have been done,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
even with people
here, to stop this.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I think,
like I told you before,

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
anything that's going to
destroy more than 70%,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.175 align:middle line:84%
75% of the population, the ETs
are not going to let happen.

00:18:07.175 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So if they were to
release a virus like that,

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
it would destroy pretty
much the entire population

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
almost unless you have
the antibodies for that.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think it won't
happen, number one.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And number two, if it did,
I'm sure the white hats

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and the Alliance already
has an antigen for that

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.600 align:middle line:84%
that could easily be
put in the atmosphere.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.029 align:middle line:90%
And we would all be fine.

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really think
they have our backs.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Has the Alliance
been actively invading these

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
facilities and
shutting them down?

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of--

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I've heard this from--

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they've been
getting in there.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot
of moles in there

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:84%
seeing how far they're
going and securing our best

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:90%
interests at hand, for sure.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm not
really concerned about it.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of just an
ego, like I said, thing.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard
from other insiders

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that they've just
hit brick wall.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Any time the cabal's tried
to do even the tiniest

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
bit of this stuff, they just
hit brick wall, brick wall.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Can't get it to work.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They can't because
they're trying to put DNA

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.352 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
the right people.

00:19:10.352 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
They're having some
really severe issues,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:90%
like I said, mixing the DNA.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, let's say,
for instance, dogs--

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:84%
you can mate dogs
all over the place,

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all different
kinds of dogs.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.895 align:middle line:90%
They can all have puppies.

00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And they're all
descended from wolves, usually.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They all come from
one, the wolf.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So what they don't
understand is you

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
can't get certain mutated
ET DNA with human ET

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:84%
with another mutated
different ET human

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and try to make
something out of that

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
because those are
definitely not from one.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because they're
from multiple different.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: All right,
well, let me ask you this.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: If we're looking
at us evolving and becoming

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
a spacefaring race, which we
already have the technology.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just not being disclosed
to the majority of us.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Then much in the
same way that we

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
have different races
on Earth that actually,

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
from what some insiders tell
me, the races we have on Earth

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
are much more different
looking from one another

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.604 align:middle line:84%
than most other ET planets,
that they're often very similar

00:20:15.604 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:90%
looking to each other.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Would you say that's true?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Absolutely,
that's true.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.964 align:middle line:90%
We're a very diverse society.

00:20:22.964 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have many
different lineages

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
from many different
extraterrestrials.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But we're still all able
to mate and have children.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
But we still have very
different lineages.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:90%
You're correct.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So as we grow up
and become more of a galactic

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
family, how does this work in
terms of sexual reproduction

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.140 align:middle line:84%
with other humans that
might have evolved on other

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:90%
earth-like planets?

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Is that possible based
on your knowledge?

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Based on my knowledge,
absolutely possible, 100%.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
like the dog theory.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
There are many
different kinds of dogs.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
kinds of humans.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:90%
But guess what.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:90%
We all come from one.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So how do you think
this could play out in terms

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:84%
of maybe the greater plan of how
we evolve through the changing

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:90%
conditions on Earth?

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know what
you've heard about this,

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
but we've talked a lot about
the changes in the sun,

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:84%
changes in the solar system,
and that life on Earth,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that the conditions
will be very different.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard about the
idea that our solar system is

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.339 align:middle line:90%
undergoing some sort of change?

00:21:32.339 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, I think you're
probably referring to the solar

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.300 align:middle line:84%
flare and different
other planets nearby.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge change
in the solar system.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And we will be affected.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Our light bodies will
be affected by this.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So do you think that
if we start to meet other races

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to have this sort
of cross-cultural coupling take

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
place, that this could be part
of how humanity evolves in some

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:90%
way?

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Not only evolves,
it's how humanity survives.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What are some of the
positive aspects that might

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.875 align:middle line:84%
Like let's say that we
meet up with a race that's

00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:15.200 align:middle line:90%
much more spiritually adept.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:90%
If we coupled--

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, you look
at Greek mythology, right?

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:90%
You have gods.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
You have what they
would call men.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And then you have heroes.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And the heroes are the
offspring of gods and men.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:84%
But heroes would
be like Hercules.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:84%
These are people that have
stupendous superpowers.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And they're not even full gods.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So are you aware of there
being humans out there that

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
have abilities like
what the gods would have

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:90%
had in the Greek mythology?

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, I am.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And this would include
what kinds of superpowers?

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, powers that
we would look in our history

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of levitation, not having
to eat, things like that,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:84%
able to produce light and
fire, able to travel in space,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
able to not have to
worry about temperature,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.256 align:middle line:90%
not have to worry about oxygen.

00:23:15.256 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Bilocation?

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.287 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, bilocation.

00:23:18.287 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Telepathy?

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.745 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah,
telepathy is a big one.

00:23:20.745 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of cognitive
function powers

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have that
it's just so far above us.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't understand
because they're

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.540 align:middle line:90%
able to connect to the cosmos.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you think that
at some point people like this

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:41.465 align:middle line:84%
might deliberately want to
start coupling with us in order

00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
for the greater
good in some sense,

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
like the idea of
heroes being born?

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I do believe
that we are the superheroes

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:90%
of the universe--

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:90%
earthlings, believe it or not.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
They look upon us
as the superheroes

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't
exist, they don't exist.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And they also look at us like,
wow, they get to taste and hear

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and smell and see.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And they don't know.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of them don't
know what that is.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.485 align:middle line:84%
Some don't have full
digestive systems

00:24:09.485 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
because their planetary
atmosphere gives them

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:90%
everything they need.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So we are looked as
heroes, believe it or not.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
We look into the movies and
look at these extraterrestrials

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:84%
in the skies above like,
wow, that's so amazing.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But really, they're looking
back saying the same thing.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: There's a lot of
talk about the pineal gland.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So many ancient
cultures, this gland

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the brain--

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.455 align:middle line:90%
and I studied the physiology.

00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I know
you have, right.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And it's
got retinal tissue.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: That's right.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And there's
this water in there.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And so we're hearing that--

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
from various insiders,
I've heard that the pineal

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:90%
gland functions as a star gate.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And that if we have a fully
activated pineal gland,

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:90%
that we would be like gods.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:90%
We could go wherever we want.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So don't you get the sense
with all these humans

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
out there and how advanced they
are, that we're spring loaded?

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
this that we're not using.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We have everything
that everyone else has.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.875 align:middle line:90%
We're just not activated yet.

00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's silly because that's
why we are the superheroes.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
We have more than everyone
else, believe it or not.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if we could
just figure out that code

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and get that download
and ascend properly,

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
then we could be
a flash of light

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.391 align:middle line:84%
or take this form
or any form we want.

00:25:31.391 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: One of the interesting
things that Corey Goode has

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.550 align:middle line:84%
shared with us is this concept
that a variety of different ET

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:39.350 align:middle line:90%
groups--

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of which
are more human like--

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that in his program they call
genetic farmers were apparently

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
taking the very best
ascension type of DNA

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and then mixing it
all together here--

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
that they had 22 major
different programs on Earth.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So do you think
it's possible that--

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.400 align:middle line:90%
because you kind of said that.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Not quite as specific
as I said, but do

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you think that
Earth might be sort

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:13.680 align:middle line:84%
of like a garden in which these
advanced super powers have

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:84%
been stored inside of us
for future activation?

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the womb that
we're still growing in,

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and still evolving in, and
waiting to be activated,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and reaching out, making
the intention to reach out,

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to be activated, and to ask
for other cultures to visit,

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:90%
and to be part of that.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: When I read the
"Law of One" material,

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I started to have
psychic experiences.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I started to hear voices that
were benevolent, positive,

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:90%
giving me positive guidance.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:90%
And they call that tuning.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm curious
if you feel that

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:84%
even apart from the
sexual reproduction thing,

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:84%
just simply being exposed
to advanced humans,

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:84%
simply talking to them or
being in their presence

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:90%
would start to activate.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It would
totally activate.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Your field that you
put off is everywhere.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's, of course, right
here most concentrated.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.882 align:middle line:84%
So being in another person's
field, someone comes home angry

00:27:17.882 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and then everyone else
gets angry in the house.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Or someone comes home
laughing and giggling,

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the angry person at home
starts laughing and giggling.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the same concept.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But it actually does
a frequency change

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to modify DNA by
being around people

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
be around and being

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:84%
around beings that
have a little bit more,

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:84%
say, energy and
frequency than you do.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Because it ups your frequency.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
get to that frequency.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I remember
talking to Henry Deacon,

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:84%
who was the first really heavy
duty space program insider who

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I got to talk to.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he's never been
willing to come forward now.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.374 align:middle line:84%
He did come forward a little
bit back in 2009 in public

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
after talking to
me for two years.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:90%
We had extensive conversations.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said that the feeling
of love and peace around some

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:84%
of these extraterrestrial
humans was so amazing

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:84%
that it was literally-- it
would bring you to tears.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, overwhelming.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
First hand experience is the
most overwhelming feeling

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:90%
of love and compassion.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:90%
And you can't even speak.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:26.275 align:middle line:84%
You're just so overwhelmed with
this joy feeling, and you do.

00:28:26.275 --> 00:28:27.075 align:middle line:90%
You start crying.

00:28:27.075 --> 00:28:28.283 align:middle line:90%
You might fall to your knees.

00:28:28.283 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:90%
You might just pass right out.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:90%
It's that intense.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Because what these-- not
all extraterrestrials,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:84%
but most of them have this
ability and compassion for us

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and they love us so much that
if you get next to one of these

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials,
you can not even--

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:84%
you'll just get all
teary eyed and laugh

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:90%
and cry at the same time.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.447 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful,
beautiful thing.

00:28:53.447 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: That's really amazing.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I want to thank
you again for bravely exposing

some of the things
that are going on.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that when
we speak truth to the power,

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%
we empower the truth.
