00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:10%
a retired special agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're talking about a
young contactee who was later

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:90%
recruited by the Air Force.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to be here, Emery.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Who was Cady Smith?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Cady Smith was
born in Montana.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:90%
She grew up on a farm.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
When she was three
years old, her parents

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:84%
noticed that she had
some unique ability.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
She could go out on the
porch and look up in the sky

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:90%
and call in a star.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what her mother relates.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
The star would come
down close to her,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
would never actually
reach the ground.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And then Cady would
talk to the star.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, Cady was three
years old at this time,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
so she didn't know a
whole lot of language.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But she could still
talk to the star.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Her parents thought
it was fascinating

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't figure out
exactly how she was doing this

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and even why she was doing it.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
A few years later, Cady went
to a camp in northern Idaho.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And while she was at the camp,
she walked out beyond the lake,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:84%
sat in the evening hours
looking up at the sky.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, a light
appeared above her.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:90%
A counselor saw this.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And the counselor ran
over to her thinking

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
it was a falling star or
something out of the ordinary.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.953 align:middle line:90%
And Cady put her hand up.

00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, Cady was only eight
years old at the time

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and said, stop,
to the counselor.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:90%
It's my friends.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So the counselor watched as
she was engulfed in a glow just

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:90%
for a few seconds.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And the glow went away.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And the counselor went
over to Cady and said,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:90%
what just happened?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And Cady said, I just
spoke to my friends.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, the counselor thought
that she was injured

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
or something occurred that the
counselor couldn't understand.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.985 align:middle line:84%
The counselor was
only a 20-year-old.

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So as the counselor took
her over to the infirmary,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
a nurse examined Cady, didn't
find anything wrong with her,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:90%
but made a report.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And when her parents picked
her up from camp that Friday,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.415 align:middle line:84%
the nurse gave the
parents this report.

00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:39.665 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was in the report?

00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The report was of what
happened and what Cady told

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
the counselor or the nurse
that, I called my friends in.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to talk to my friends.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to go out in a
remote area with no one else

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
around, she didn't think,
and called my friends in.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And the nurse was concerned and
told her parents in this note

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that she was concerned
that maybe there

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
was something psychologically
wrong with Cady.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So jump ahead a few
years, Cady's walking

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:90%
down a road with another girl.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
They're walking from one house.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, they live in a
remote area of Montana,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
one house to another house
or some distance away.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was the summertime.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And they were walking
actually in this little canal.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And as it got up
to a culvert, Cady

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
stopped and told her friend,
get out of the culvert.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Run up there right now.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:90%
So the little girl ran up there.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Cady went into the culvert.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And according to the little
girl, Cady disappeared.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So the girl panicked and
ran to the closest farmhouse

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and yelled that she needed help,
that Cady Smith disappeared.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the police, the
sheriff's department came.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And they looked,
but they found her.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
She was walking
out of the culvert.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I was just
in there with some friends.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But one of the deputies
thought that was odd.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the deputy put Cady
in the back of his patrol car

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:90%
and talked to her.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, now explain to
me exactly what happened.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And Cady did, explaining
that her friends were there

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
in the culvert, and she wanted
to talk to her friends alone.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So the deputy said, well,
who is your friends?

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Where are they from?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.673 align:middle line:90%
Take me to your friends.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And Cady said, I can't
take you to my friends.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:90%
My friends live in the sky.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:90%
They're from another planet.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So the deputy thought, well,
OK, she's a little weird.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Cuckoo.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Took her home.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Told her parents, hey, she's
talking about some aliens that

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:90%
came down and talked to her.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And her parents had
heard this story before.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:90%
So they said, OK, whatever.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How old was
she at this point?

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> About 10 years old.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, then jump ahead to
Cady was 17 years old,

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:90%
first year in college.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:90%
She went to college in Montana.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Her and her friend went out.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
One night, her roommate,
out of the dormitory,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:84%
went up the mountain
to look at the stars.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Cady told her friend, I
love looking at the stars.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And I go up, and I
talk to my friends.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.787 align:middle line:84%
Well, Cady's friend
didn't really

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:90%
know what she was talking about.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But Cady went up there,
got out of the vehicle.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They went out and
sat on the ground

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
looking at the stars on a
really beautiful spring evening.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden, a
light came towards them.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Her girlfriend panicked and
said, oh my god, what is that?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And she ran back
towards the car.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But Cady sat there
because Cady knew

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.530 align:middle line:90%
that her friends were coming.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So, again, she was
encased in some glow

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:90%
for just a few seconds.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And then the glow went away.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And the friend saw this?

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>> The friend saw this.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But the friend got really
scared because Cady wouldn't

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:90%
move from where she was at.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So she went up to Cady and
asked, Cady, come on, let's go.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And Cady was in a
catatonic state.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't move.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
Cady started floating.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Like, she was floating away.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, her friend, whose
name was Sharon, panicked,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
got in the vehicle,
which was Cady's vehicle,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and drove to the
nearest house, asked

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to call for the
sheriff's department.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Sheriff's department came out.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Sharon tells the sheriff's
deputies what happened.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:90%
So they went up looking for her.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:90%
They have a search party.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't find
her where she was.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
They found her some distance
away walking out of a forest.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And the deputies asked,
are you all right?

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Were you abducted?

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
She says, no, I was
just with my friends.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, who's your friends?

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, she tells the
deputies the same thing.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:90%
My friends are from outer space.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.292 align:middle line:90%
And so the deputies go.

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>> And she's older now.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, she's older.

00:06:58.125 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:90%
She's almost 18 years old.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So the deputies thought
it was a hoax, a prank

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:90%
and cautioned them not to do it.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They can get in trouble
and so forth and so on.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.115 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And then jump ahead, Cady
graduates from college.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
She had a calling, so to
speak, for the military.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Her dad had been
in the military.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Her grandfather had
been in the military.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So Cady decided to
join the Air Force.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:90%
She went through ROTC.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was commissioned as a
second lieutenant in the United

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:90%
States Air Force.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And because of her
somewhat unique abilities

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and likes and dislikes, they
placed her in intelligence.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.020 align:middle line:84%
She went to the intelligence
operations course in Virginia.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
She went to a Russian
language school.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:90%
And this is in the '80s.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:90%
And then she went to Europe.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
She went to Germany,
West Berlin.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
She was assigned
to a special team

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
to track Soviets operating
in and around West Berlin.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Her boss, who was a
major, noticed immediately

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that Cady was different
from anyone else,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
not just because she was
female, but she was just

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:90%
a different person.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> In what way?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> She seemed to be
able to sense things.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
When she went out
on an operation,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:84%
she was tailing these
Soviets like she knew

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:90%
exactly what they were doing.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
She could hear them.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Or she was reading their minds.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
She knew exactly
what was going on.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So one day after an
operation, a big operation

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
where they captured
two Soviets that

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
attempted to enter a
American-controlled building

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
inside West Berlin,
the major called Cady.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And Cady was a first
lieutenant at this time.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And the major said, Cady, that
mission we went on last night,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
it was a fantastic
mission, very successful.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But what I don't
understand is, how

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:90%
were you able to follow those--

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> How does she know?

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you know this?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, Major, I want
to tell you how, but I can't.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Because you won't believe me.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:90%
The major said, try me.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.795 align:middle line:84%
So Cady said, OK,
sir, I have friends.

00:09:18.795 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.165 align:middle line:84%
And the major looked at her
and said, OK, you have friends.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:90%
You have assets?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:90%
You've recruited other agents?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, I have
friends, other friends.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Who are these other friends?

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:90%
This part you won't believe.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
They're extraterrestrials.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.903 align:middle line:90%
They're always with me.

00:09:39.903 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course,
the major didn't.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
After listening to this
and reading her report,

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
the major sent her to the
United States Air Force Hospital

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:90%
at East Point.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:90%
For a psychological examination.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And she went through all
sorts of psychological testing

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and spoke to a psychiatrist.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:90%
She had a medical examination.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Found nothing wrong with her.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And the last person
she spoke with

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
was a psychologist, a
female psychologist,

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
who was not military, who was
a civilian GS psychologist.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Cady, I
want you to talk to me.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
answer my questions.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And everything you
tell me is going

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to be held in confidence
between you and I. Now, little

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
did Cady knew that
who she was talking to

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:90%
was an Air Force OSI.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Anyways, she tells the story.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Cady tells the
story to this agent

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
who is posing as a
psychologist about the aliens,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:90%
about her friends.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
They've been with her since
she can remember, when

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:90%
she was two or three years old.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:90%
They were always by her side.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:90%
They protected her.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
They always wanted to
know what she was doing.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be with her when
she was doing these things.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the psychologist
said, that's fascinating.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:90%
So how do you call them?

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't
have to call them.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:90%
They're just with me.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> They're always there.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And the psychologist said,
can you bring them here to this

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:90%
room?

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And Cady says, I don't have to.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:90%
They're already here.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.723 align:middle line:90%
Can they show themselves?

00:11:15.723 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
No, they're not going
to show themselves

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
to you, because you're
not their friend.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm their friend.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And so this psychologist
said, OK, well,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.486 align:middle line:84%
thank you for the interview
and so forth and so on.

00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:90%
And that one ended.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, they cleared her
to go back to work,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to go back to West
Berlin and said,

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong with her.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
She's not psychologically
out of touch with reality.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:90%
She's sane.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So she went back to
work, but they put her

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:90%
in a different office.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So she wasn't really out
following Soviets anymore.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the psychologist, who
was actually an OSI agent,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
did a detailed report,
sent it back to Washington.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Now she's in the database.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, jump ahead, Cady is
discharged from the Air Force.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:90%
She served for six years.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
She gets a job in
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
with a biological company,
biological research company.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And she goes to work every day.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:84%
She lives on the west
side of Albuquerque.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:90%
She loves to go for walks.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
She goes out in the
West Mesa all the time,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:84%
goes out to the old volcano,
looks at the petroglyphs.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she's out
there one night.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And she's just walking,
beautiful New Mexico night,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:90%
a late summer.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And she walks down in
this one particular area

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
coming back from one
of the volcanoes.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And she sees an
object in the sky.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And she looks, and she
says, it's a light.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And she's watching this light,
and she's studying this light.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, it's
not my friends, because I

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:90%
know who my friends are.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:90%
So she's watching it.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.515 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, it comes in.

00:13:09.515 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, she thinks at first it's
a helicopter, but it's not.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It lands, and she
walks towards it.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And these two entities come
out, nonhuman entities--

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Did she describe
this craft, I mean?

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a saucer-shaped craft.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
The two entities
wore silvery suits.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They had helmets on.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
She could look into
the helmet, and she

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:90%
could see just two eyes.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't see anything else.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
She immediately knew that
these two were not her friends.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:84%
These two entities
were not her friends.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
She's decided to turn around
and go back to her vehicle.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But the faster she
was moving and running

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
to get to her vehicle, which is
some distance away in a parking

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
area, these two entities
never lost contact with her.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
They were always there.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Then, suddenly, she sees
a helicopter coming.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:90%
And she knows it's a helicopter.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:90%
She sees it's a helicopter.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:84%
She's been in the
Air Force six years.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:90%
She knows what a helicopter is.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:84%
She sees a helicopter,
and she says, well, wow,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I hope I can flag them down.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:90%
They can help me.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, she turns.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
She notices that
the two entities

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:90%
weren't behind her anymore.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
There was a little
distance behind her.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, the helicopter landed.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a United States
Air Force helicopter.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:90%
She saw the markings.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So she ran over
to the helicopter.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
A crew member came out and
said, are you all right, Cady?

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And Cady says, yes.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And she turned to point
at the two entities.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But then she turned to
the crew member and says,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:90%
how do my name?

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And the crew member said, we
know a lot about you, Cady.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:90%
We're here to help you.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And then Cady said later--

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
she didn't know if
it was a joke or not.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But the crew member
says, it's a good thing

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
we got here when we did, or
that alien would have eaten you.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Eaten you?

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Eaten you?

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So, anyways, when
the helicopter landed,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:90%
the ETs left.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So Cady thinks, now
why did this happen?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:90%
How did the Air Force know?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
All the crew member said
was, you're all right.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
They're going to leave.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Get in your vehicle, and
you'll be all right now.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
A couple of days later, two
OSI agents come to her house,

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:90%
knocked on the door.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%
One of them is yours
truly, Richard Doty.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, we knew about Cady.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:84%
We had been following
her for a long time,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:90%
actually during ROTC.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:90%
We knew she was different.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know quite
how different she was,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:90%
but we knew she was different.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
She had abilities that was far
beyond any human abilities.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is before DNA.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:90%
But we had other methods.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We--I'm saying the government
had other methods to determine

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
a human and an ET,

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
whether it be interbreeding
or something to that effect.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't knowledgeable
of everything

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that the government
knew about that.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But we were able to
track and follow her

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:90%
when she got out of the service.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when we went
to her work, we

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:84%
said, Cady, we want to talk
to you about night before last

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
or whenever it was,
two nights ago.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And she says, how did you
know to come out there?

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, we just know.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We just knew where
you were going to be.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
She said, you're
friends with my friends.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to be
friends with your friends.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
your friends are.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But I want to be friends
with your friends.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.005 align:middle line:90%
She said, OK.

00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, can you introduce
me to your friends?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
She says, they're
not here with me now.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:90%
She said, I don't know why.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be more distanced
from me than they were before.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we did an
initial interview of her.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And then later, we met her at
another place that evening,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.670 align:middle line:90%
myself and the other agent.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.648 align:middle line:90%
And this is where she opened up.

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And she told me about all
these different stories

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:90%
that I related to you.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever have any doubts
with her story before that?

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
We had the major's
report from West Berlin.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:90%
We had the ROTC report.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We had the sheriff's
department report from Montana.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:90%
We knew she was different.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So there was a way before DNA
testing that we could test her.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And we asked her if we
could test or put her

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:90%
through some tests.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a psychological
polygraph examination,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
a hypnotic one, where you
put them under hypnosis,

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and you give them a
polygraph examination.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:90%
You can't lie.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
impossibility of lying.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Initially, she revolt--

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, I don't
really want to do that.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, we were hoping
you would help us and work

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:90%
with us on other projects.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, you've been in the
Air Force for six years,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:90%
and you really enjoyed it.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
love the Air Force.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated
with the Air Force.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated with what
I did and this and this.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, we can get you
in on another area.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were an
intelligence operations officer.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We can get you in another area
of intelligence, which would be

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:90%
probably more suitable to you.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said, what
are you talking about?

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I said, with your friends.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
You know that
extraterrestrials exist.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:90%
You talk to them all the time.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.815 align:middle line:90%
Says, yeah.

00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, what if
I was to tell you

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.988 align:middle line:90%
that we know about all that?

00:19:10.988 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:90%
That piqued her interest.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And then she decided to
cooperate with us, so--

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you got the test.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Then we did the test.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
And during the test--

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and now there's psychologists
doing these tests.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a psychologist,
and I'm not a scientist.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But the readings that they take
determine patterns of behavior

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and patterns of thought.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And they can look at
these and compare them

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to just a normal human,
a normal person taking

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%
this same type of
test and determine

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:84%
that her brain activity
far exceeds that of others.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
connected her then

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
to being part ET, part alien.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
When I confronted
her with that, she

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
said, yeah, they told me they've
been with me all my life.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So I just assumed that I
probably was one of them.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And somehow they
put me in this body.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And she told us something that
was quite fascinating to me.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
She says, sometimes I feel very
uncomfortable in this body.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:90%
I want to be in their body.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, why do you say that?

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
She said, I just feel
awkward in this body.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you have
past life experiences?

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.185 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, many.

00:20:44.185 --> 00:20:45.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Did she recall
the other body?

00:20:45.973 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> She recalls the other body,
and she tells a story about

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:90%
a planet.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And she's had this dream or this
vision many, many, many, many,

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:90%
many times over her lifetime.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And she's 28 or
29 at this point.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about being
in this huge open area where

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
there's people all over
living in these small huts.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it was so unique
because I could look in and see

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:90%
inside each hut.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And the people would
wave to me when

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I was looking in these huts.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like I was bigger
and taller than the others.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And as I was walking down
through all these huts,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
saying hi to these
people, I was taller.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I didn't
have the same body as they had.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why
am I different?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Why am I so different?

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't understand
it during these dreams

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:90%
that she was having.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But now she realized
that she was a human born

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:90%
on this other planet.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And these people respected her
or maybe even worshipped her

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.390 align:middle line:84%
because she was
different than they were,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:90%
because they were the ETs.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
They were the short four-foot
tall, Eben looking or gray

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
looking.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And she's the tall
human looking.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
She says, it's so
confusing to me

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
understand why I'm

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:90%
different than everyone else.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized that I'm
the human on this other planet.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> In the dream.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:84%
In this dream and reoccurring
over and over again.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not a doctor, and
I'm not a psychiatrist.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's medical
diagnosis for somebody's having

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
the same dream over and over
and over and over again.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
necessarily abnormal.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But it can tell, it can dictate
to experts thought pattern

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and behavioral patterns.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And so she knew then she was
different than everybody else.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:90%
So we pitched her.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how would you like

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:84%
to work for the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations?

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And she said, sure, what
do you want me to do?

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that began her career
as a civilian contract person

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:90%
within the Air Force.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.555 align:middle line:90%
>> So she didn't re-enlist.

00:23:21.555 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:90%
She took a G.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> She took a general.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.197 align:middle line:84%
And she took a contract
rather than a--

00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's different.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --civil service.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
We just contracted
her, paying her,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
but contract her to
do the work for us.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, initially, it
wasn't full-time.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:90%
It was part-time.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But, eventually,
it was full-time.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, over the years, she
continued and continued

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
at the point when we were
doing the DNA testing--

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Rick, real quick, what
did you have her do when she

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:90%
joined your team there?

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we had her--

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:84%
sought out other
people like her.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And she had a unique
ability, like I said.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And whether it was her
friends who we never saw,

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
she would say the
friends were with her.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
If we were on some
kind of an operation

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:84%
where we wanted to go
out and find some people,

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
she would say, my
friends are with me.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:90%
I never saw her friends.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I never interfaced
with her friends.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:90%
But she was doing that.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was convinced--

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's other OSI
agents that were with me saying,

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:90%
she's nuts.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't see anybody.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:90%
But I believed her.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe that she was doing
things that we couldn't do,

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:90%
nobody else could do.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to go out
and find people.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
She did find people,
people that were like her.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.350 align:middle line:84%
One of our first
operations was we

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go out and find two
people, male, female, whoever

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that were like her, that
were being controlled

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:84%
or under the influence
of extraterrestrials.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.705 align:middle line:90%
>> How did she feel about that?

00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>She didn't have
any problems with it.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.160 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, they're
all around me.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, let's go.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's find some.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And in a matter of
probably two hours,

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
we were at a mall, Coronado
mall in Albuquerque.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And she pointed out people.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And we interfaced-- I didn't,
but other agents interfaced

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:84%
with those people and
found yes, they were--

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would you want other
people like her, Rick?

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, number one, we wanted
to see if we could recruit

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:84%
other people with the same
abilities that she had.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to make sure
that these people that she

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:84%
was telling us about
weren't hostile in some way.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, we
had other people--

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do it, but other
people trail those other people

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.738 align:middle line:84%
and find out more about them,
do background investigations.

00:25:51.738 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:84%
We didn't interfere with
their lives or anything.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to know if they
were who they claimed to be

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and whether they were
hostile, because we knew there

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:90%
were hostile ETs out there.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:90%
We knew that.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
The general public didn't
know that, but we knew that.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't want these
hostile intelligence--

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, hostile ETs
out there interfering

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:84%
with intelligence
operations or the public

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
or jeopardizing
national security.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
were doing this op.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you ever able to obtain
these hostile extraterrestrials

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:90%
or point them out?

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I personally never did.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I never identified
anyone as being hostile.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But there were other OSI agents
at other locations, especially

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.670 align:middle line:84%
around Washington,
DC, that did identify

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:90%
some hostile alien intelligence.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And they dealt with them there.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:90%
But I personally never did.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And how would you deal with
an aggressive extraterrestrial

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:90%
race?

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We had set procedures
to deal with the hostile

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial race.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We have, within the
special projects branch,

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:84%
we had policies and
procedures, highly classified,

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that covered exactly how
we would deal with them.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:90%
And those are still classified.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And I best not talk about them.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, to be clear, do they
fully have the appearance

00:27:17.132 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:90%
of human being here on Earth?

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, to a point.

00:27:21.928 --> 00:27:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of them-- and
I say almost all of them

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:90%
because there's exceptions.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of them had
some form of deformity,

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:90%
some type of deformity.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But you really had to
look at or determine--

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it took a doctor.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But there were some
that didn't have any.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And although we knew
they were hostile,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
we knew how to determine they
were hostile, most of them,

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
we could find that deformity
and deal with it there.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Did Cady have a
deformity as well?

00:27:55.850 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, she had a very strange
deformity that you wouldn't see

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:90%
in the outside.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have any ovaries.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, they found it out during
her medical examination

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:84%
when she came into
the Air Force.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:90%
It was documented.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:90%
She was born with no ovaries.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, there are women
that have that condition.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:84%
They have the uterus, but
they don't have the ovaries.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And so it was not uncommon.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:90%
So she couldn't have children.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And that affected her sometimes.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean we had long
conversations about it.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know, I
would like to have children.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.660 align:middle line:90%
But I have other children.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.570 align:middle line:84%
My friends are my children
and so forth and so on.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And now jump ahead to when we
developed DNA tests for this.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Now she wasn't the only
asset we had that we

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:90%
knew was extraterrestrial.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
We went out and
rounded them all up

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and did DNA tests, the ones
that we could determine.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:90%
The experts came in and did it.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> How many at that time?

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there were
12, roughly 12, for OSI.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.460 align:middle line:90%
And we tested them.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
she had alien DNA.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's the Cady Smith story.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to tasking
her to find extraterrestrials

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:84%
in the human form, did you
also task her to talk about her

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:90%
friends and where they're from?

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we spent a lot of
time talking about her friends.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:84%
She had no inabilities to
talk about her friends.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.360 align:middle line:84%
She spoke about them, describing
what they looked like.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And she was describing, gray
ETs, how they spoke to her, how

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:90%
they protected her.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But we were never able to
see or interface with them.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we wanted to do--

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and we went into a
very secure facility.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And we asked her, are
your friends with you?

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes, they're
right here with me.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, we just want somehow
for them to appear to me--

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and it was two of us,
two agents there--

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.610 align:middle line:84%
appear in whatever
appearance they

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:30.020 align:middle line:84%
want to do or even speak
to us in their mind.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Some sort of communication.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Some sort of communication.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Some definitive answer.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I said, I believe
that they're here.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I strongly believe that
you're in contact with them.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I know that you're part ET.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I know you're probably part
whatever species they are.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But to prove it to myself
and my organization,

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
please just show me
something that could prove.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:90%
She says, OK, just a moment.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And now what she did
was she put herself--

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and, again, I'm not a
doctor, a medical expert.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But to me, she put herself
in a catatonic state.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Her eyes went up.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Her eyelids never
completely shut.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Her eyelids went
straight up, and they

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:90%
stayed fixed in that way.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.280 align:middle line:84%
She was frozen,
like, she was frozen.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And for probably-- I
don't know how long--

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
30 or 40 seconds,
didn't move a muscle,

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.020 align:middle line:84%
didn't move anything
on her body.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.157 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was she doing?

00:31:41.157 --> 00:31:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Communicating, I guess.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, all right.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
she comes to.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what just happened?

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
She said, I just
communicated with them.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
to talk to you.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, why wouldn't
they want to talk to me?

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:84%
She says because you have
hostile thoughts in your mind,

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.602 align:middle line:90%
because there's two of us there.

00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, I told you,
every time before you meet

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.852 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial, you've
got to blank your mind out.

00:32:09.852 --> 00:32:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I tried.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I tried.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But being an
intelligence officer,

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:84%
all the training
that we went through,

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:18.960 align:middle line:90%
you're always on the defensive.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're the warrior.

00:32:20.127 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And I probably had that
warrior mentality of--

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.195 align:middle line:84%
and besides, to think
back, we had our guns on.

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very intimidating.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Both of us had our guns on.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And although they
were concealed,

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I think, OK, that
makes sense to me.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Here we are sitting here
in this room, two of us

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.990 align:middle line:90%
have hostile intent, probably.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:84%
If these things were to
appear and they were hostile,

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:90%
what would we do?

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
We probably had all this
going through our mind.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
we had guns on,

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I could understand her
response, although at the time,

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:90%
it puzzled me.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So we never were
able to interface.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
We never saw them, never
had any kind of visual.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:84%
We actually brought
in some female agents

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
to try to interface
with her away from us.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.610 align:middle line:90%
And that never worked either.

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So we were never
able to interface,

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
connect with her
friends, or communicate

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:90%
in any way with her friends.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, could you give us
more of a description of them?

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Easily all the time,
she described them to us.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:84%
No matter where we were at and
what particular time period

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.627 align:middle line:84%
or operation we were on, I was
always asking her questions.

00:33:35.627 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Are your friends with you?

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Are they here now?

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Was she always answering
the same each time?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> She was always
answering the same thing,

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.260 align:middle line:90%
that they appeared to be Greys.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:90%
They look grey.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:84%
What she described to
me, they were Greys.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:90%
And she had names for them.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:90%
She had Ho and Bo.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to mention this.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:90%
And she would say--

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:90%
I said to her, they named--

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.700 align:middle line:84%
they said, they're
called-- no, no, no no, she

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
said, I named them Ho and Bo.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:90%
I said, why was Ho?

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:84%
She says, you know,
hobo, Ho and Bo.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, they were both male?

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
She said, yeah,
they're both male.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And here's something that I
didn't think of initially.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But one of my
supervisors says, make

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:28.080 align:middle line:84%
sure you ask her if they're the
same ones over and over again.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.669 align:middle line:84%
And so at one time
I'm with her and--

00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:33.469 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.927 align:middle line:84%
I remember we were
in an operation.

00:34:34.927 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, I said, let me
ask you a question, Cady, are

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:90%
they the same two all the time?

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.780 align:middle line:90%
She said, yeah, the same.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I said, have you ever
spoken to any other ones?

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, but I know
these are the ones that

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:90%
are assigned to me.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.422 align:middle line:90%
They're mine.

00:34:52.422 --> 00:34:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you believe
their mission was, Rick?

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Guardians.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what-- I asked her.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I think from the
very, very first time

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I met her after the West
Mesa incident, I asked her.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, so these things
have been with you

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:90%
since you were three years old?

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
She said, they were
with me before I

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:90%
was born, in the other life.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:84%
She kept calling
it the other life.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why are
they always with you?

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:90%
She says, my guardians.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:90%
They're my guardians.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.403 align:middle line:90%
And then I asked her--

00:35:23.403 --> 00:35:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember if it
was that time or other.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, so they're like
your guardian angels?

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.960 align:middle line:90%
No, they're not angels.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, so they're
just your guardians.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, thinking now about what
I should have followed up

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:45.470 align:middle line:84%
as far as the angels go, why was
she so hesitant about calling,

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:90%
no, they're not angels?

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Was it her--

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, differentiation of--

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:90%
she had a belief maybe.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, or religious beliefs.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I was sorry for not
asking her that question.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Has Cady ever shared with
you what her mission is here

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In a number of
different conversations,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:11.020 align:middle line:84%
not one particular conversation
about her direct missions.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.900 align:middle line:90%
But she did talk about humanity.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:19.130 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about
how she can serve.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.950 align:middle line:84%
She said, one reason I
went in the Air Force--

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to serve, to serve my
country and serve myself.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, did
they give you a mission?

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Did your friends
give you a mission?

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.140 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I have free will with them.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't restrict
me on anything.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.420 align:middle line:90%
I can do anything I want to do.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And she told me a story,
which I'm hesitant about

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.950 align:middle line:84%
to tell the whole story,
about a relationship she

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:53.598 align:middle line:90%
had with a man.

00:36:53.598 --> 00:36:55.140 align:middle line:84%
This is why she was
in the Air Force.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:84%
After she got out of
intelligence operations course,

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:84%
she went to the Russian language
school at the National Language

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:05.628 align:middle line:84%
Institute in Washington, DC, not
the Defense Language Institute.

00:37:05.628 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
in Washington DC.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:84%
She went to that
Russian language course.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And she met a guy.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And he asked her out, and
she went out with him.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But she was always scared to
do anything out of the ordinary

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:84%
as far as going to the next
step in a relationship.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to make it clear,
polite in that manner.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:84%
She was always afraid that
her friends would stop her.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why she never got
into an intimate relationship,

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:84%
which was kind of an
odd story to tell.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But this other agent
that was with me,

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.550 align:middle line:84%
he was more senior than I
was and more experienced.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was also
one of the agents

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that handle a lot of
different abduction cases.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So he had more experience
in that arena of contactees

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:90%
than I did.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:02.498 align:middle line:84%
But he asked her, do you
think, even though you

00:38:02.498 --> 00:38:05.040 align:middle line:84%
said you had free will, do you
think that they're controlling

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:90%
you psychologically?

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you just told
us a story about a man that you

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:13.920 align:middle line:90%
met, you liked.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And you wanted to carry
on a relationship.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And you felt threatened
by your friends.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And she thought about it,
and she said, yeah, I was.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that
they would have stopped me.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I've just felt that I
would be looked down upon.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe we fully
was able to communicate

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:90%
100% with her.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's only because her
friends, who are probably

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Greys, are preventing it.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Where is Cady today?

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Cady is alive and well
living in New Mexico.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And she still is associated
with United States intelligence.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Would she like to be a
guest on "Cosmic Disclosure?"

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I can always ask
her that question.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> We look forward to it.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Rick, that was a
fascinating story.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we get
to meet her someday.
