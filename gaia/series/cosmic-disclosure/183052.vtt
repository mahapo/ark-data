00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.563 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: We're
here with John Lear,

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.565 align:middle line:10%
and today we're going be
talking about mysteries

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
of our solar system.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.193 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, John.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.444 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming on the show.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN LEAR: Thanks, Emery.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.446 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.073 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's talk about the
planets of our solar system.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:32.908 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: OK.

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:36.495 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know, NASA loves to
limit the information they give

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.373 align:middle line:10%
us, and they don't even
know how many planets

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:40.791 align:middle line:10%
are in our solar system.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:44.878 align:middle line:84%
They tell us 9, but
there's actually 40 total.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.798 align:middle line:84%
So there's 39 planets
in addition to Earth.

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:48.674 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY:: Earth.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Now, can
we see them all?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.842 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.971 align:middle line:84%
NASA can see a few of
them, but not all of them.

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.807 align:middle line:84%
I imagine they can't
see most of them.

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.559 align:middle line:90%
ET uses a technology--

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.438 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how it works,
but it works pretty good.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.692 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY:: And does
NASA have any--

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:08.777 align:middle line:84%
have they observed
anything of these planets?

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:09.569 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.864 align:middle line:84%
They can see a few of the
39 other planets that exist,

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.284 align:middle line:90%
but they're not telling us.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.118 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:19.121 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Every one
of those 39 planets

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:90%
have different civilizations.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.458 align:middle line:90%
They trade with one another.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:84%
They trade technology,
they trade farming.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.551 align:middle line:84%
There's a massive amount of air
traffic control between them.

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.594 align:middle line:90%
So much is going on.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.348 align:middle line:84%
We're regarded as the
solar system morons.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.143 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, they
have tours from the planet

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:41.935 align:middle line:90%
to come and--

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
believe what these Earth

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.688 align:middle line:90%
people are doing now.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:45.146 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:45.354 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:01:45.354 --> 00:01:46.523 align:middle line:90%
They're going to have a war.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I was once told
we're the Disneyland

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.735 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system.

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:52.529 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: [LAUGHS] You don't
have to tell us we have four

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.281 align:middle line:90%
giants--

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.782 align:middle line:90%
gas giants.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.286 align:middle line:84%
Would be Neptune, Saturn,
Jupiter, and Uranus.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.288 align:middle line:84%
Our-- what they
call-- gas giants

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
are thriving planets with
civilizations on them

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.795 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of stuff going
on, particularly Saturn.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:12.799 align:middle line:10%
Saturn has the rings around
it that Norman Bergrun

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.636 align:middle line:10%
wrote the ring makers of
Saturn found the big spaceships

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.846 align:middle line:10%
orbiting inside the rings.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:18.638 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.307 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: All kinds of
stuff is going on.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:23.101 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With Saturn, what
are those rings made out of?

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.771 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know, I don't
know, but Saturn is probably

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
planets in our solar system.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.028 align:middle line:10%
And Lou Baldin, who I
talk to all the time,

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:36.156 align:middle line:10%
who's written books
about space and UFOs--

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.869 align:middle line:10%
he said that if you were to
look at the surface of Saturn

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.373 align:middle line:10%
from a planet a
little ways away--

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:48.001 align:middle line:10%
he said, all you have to do
is look at it for five seconds

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:10%
and you would faint
for about a day.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.549 align:middle line:84%
It would be so overwhelming
that you would literally faint.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.927 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because of
structures or because of--

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.804 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: He did not elaborate.

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.347 align:middle line:90%
He said what you see--

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.264 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Overwhelming.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.141 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: --would be
overwhelming that you

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.184 align:middle line:90%
would lose consciousness.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:04.976 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I had read some
papers, classified,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
that said that there is a
portal there on the poles

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.653 align:middle line:84%
that the ETs use to
come in and out of,

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.823 align:middle line:84%
and that it's a very popular
spot in our solar system,

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:18.615 align:middle line:90%
I'll say.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.242 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: We have
portals all over Earth,

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:22.119 align:middle line:84%
but they change
position all the time.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.911 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's due to, I
believe, the axis and also

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.335 align:middle line:84%
the gravity of all the
other planets on the sun.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.378 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.462 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: I don't know.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.216 align:middle line:84%
We know that Pari Spolter,
who wrote, "The Gravitational

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.719 align:middle line:84%
Force of the Sun," debunking
Newton's second law

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.679 align:middle line:90%
of gravitation--

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.471 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.267 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: She says that the
quantity and density of planets

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:49.062 align:middle line:84%
have nothing to do with
the gravitational force.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.607 align:middle line:84%
Now, Bob Lazar listed gravity
is made up of two waves--

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.067 align:middle line:84%
gravity A and gravity
B. Gravity A--

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
it works on an atomic
scale, and it's

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.031 align:middle line:84%
the thing that holds atoms
together in the nucleus.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:00.866 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:04.369 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And gravity B is the
gravity that holds us on Earth,

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.621 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth in
orbit around the sun,

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:10.208 align:middle line:84%
and the moon in orbit
around the Earth.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:14.171 align:middle line:84%
The gravitational A
wave is instantaneous

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.172 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:21.428 align:middle line:84%
And the way that came up is,
apparently, our government

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.514 align:middle line:84%
was trying to talk
to somebody who

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:29.102 align:middle line:84%
was many hundreds
of light years away,

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and there was some message
that came back instantly.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.693 align:middle line:84%
And either Bob or somebody
asked, how is that possible?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.446 align:middle line:84%
And they said they use a
gravity phone because a gravity

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.739 align:middle line:90%
phone is instantaneous.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.324 align:middle line:90%
The wave is instantaneous.

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:44.242 align:middle line:84%
So if you could hook
a telephone up to it,

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.621 align:middle line:84%
you could talk to somebody who
was billions of light years

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.372 align:middle line:90%
away instantly.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.416 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
gravitational gravity

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.168 align:middle line:90%
A is instantaneous.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:56.213 align:middle line:84%
You know, since Venus
is the closest to Earth,

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:57.714 align:middle line:84%
they have tried
to make us think,

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.799 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's way too hot
for anybody to live

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.595 align:middle line:90%
on Venus, which is nonsense.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:06.806 align:middle line:10%
You'll remember the Russians
had sent up the Venera series,

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:11.728 align:middle line:10%
and 800 degrees centigrade
at the surface of Venus.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.439 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell us what
those parachutes were made of.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.564 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
How would you even
get it down there?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.483 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.401 align:middle line:84%
How would you even
get it down there?

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.444 align:middle line:90%
All that's nonsense.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.655 align:middle line:84%
There's a civilization
up on Venus.

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.698 align:middle line:90%
There's several on Mars.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:90%
All of them have--

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.078 align:middle line:90%
Uranus has civilizations.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:33.792 align:middle line:84%
And the people are in
huge, round containers

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:37.796 align:middle line:90%
that contain housing.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:43.677 align:middle line:84%
And they're like 50 miles tall,
several miles in diameter,

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:90%
and they orbit Uranus.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:49.432 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Venus is a really
nice place to live,

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.058 align:middle line:90%
as are most of the--

00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:52.811 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How is that
atmosphere there?

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Same as ours.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.105 align:middle line:90%
Same as ours.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.691 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, they've
visited us several times.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.859 align:middle line:84%
If you read any of
the Adamski books,

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.611 align:middle line:90%
they look like just, you know--

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.988 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They look like what?

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Us.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.614 align:middle line:90%
Like us, right?

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:05.574 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Look like us.

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:07.409 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind
of rule that you're

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.412 align:middle line:84%
not supposed to mess with Earth
people or tell them anything.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.246 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:15.834 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So I don't know how
that's supposed to work.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.336 align:middle line:84%
So that's all I
know about Venus.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.671 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How about Mercury?

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.549 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Mercury supposed to
be hot enough to melt lead.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:27.929 align:middle line:84%
The basic misunderstanding that
we all are infused with by NASA

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.264 align:middle line:90%
is the sun is hot.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.932 align:middle line:90%
It's not hot.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:34.769 align:middle line:84%
It may look hot, but it
doesn't broadcast any heat.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.772 align:middle line:84%
You'll remember when the
first astronauts went up

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that they made a great point of
saying that they had to rotate

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.821 align:middle line:84%
the vehicles, the modules
to keep from burning

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.115 align:middle line:90%
up so that they didn't get--

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.659 align:middle line:84%
actually, there is no
heat coming from the sun,

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.371 align:middle line:84%
so you'll notice that
nobody had to rotate--

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.998 align:middle line:84%
the International
Space Station doesn't

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.792 align:middle line:84%
have to rotate because
there's no heat from the sun.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.796 align:middle line:84%
What there is coming from the
sun is an electromagnetic wave.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:05.592 align:middle line:90%
And this wave is changed from--

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.094 align:middle line:84%
it goes through our
atmosphere, and our atmosphere

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:12.182 align:middle line:84%
changes the temperature of the
atmosphere inside the Earth.

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:12.974 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:16.019 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So mercury is supposed
to be hot enough to melt lead.

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.479 align:middle line:84%
No, it's about the
same temperature

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.982 align:middle line:84%
as here because their
atmosphere modifies

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.943 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic wave
that comes out of the sun.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
With Pluto, we're told it's
cold enough to freeze an--

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.323 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
temperature as here

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.454 align:middle line:84%
because it modifies the
electromagnetic wave

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.499 align:middle line:84%
to create the proper
temperature on planet.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.209 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
with all the planets.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.628 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they have to have
this atmosphere, of course,

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:42.629 align:middle line:90%
for it to be like that.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.421 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.214 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.173 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Mars.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a lot going on there.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.343 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:53.598 align:middle line:84%
Mars has a civilization, which
is divided by two factions that

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.308 align:middle line:84%
have been fighting
for hundreds of years,

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.976 align:middle line:84%
and that fight is
still going on.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're not allowed
to land anything there.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.272 align:middle line:84%
And if we try to send
up anything there,

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:02.273 align:middle line:90%
they shoot it down.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.694 align:middle line:84%
And there's records all
the way back for, you know,

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.947 align:middle line:84%
40 or 50 years of stuff that
we've tried to send there.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:90%
The original Rover series.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.452 align:middle line:84%
We'll just start out with
the original Viking photos.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.078 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.329 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Where the two guys--

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:20.332 align:middle line:84%
I think Di Pietro
and another guy--

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:23.294 align:middle line:84%
found those two pictures
of the Cydonia region.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.087 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:28.258 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And they showed the
pyramids and the face on Mars.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:32.095 align:middle line:84%
And when Bob Lazar
worked at S4, he

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:36.265 align:middle line:84%
was shown a briefing that
had a photo, a closeup photo,

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids that showed
doors, windows, balconies,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.733 align:middle line:84%
everything-- that was all
an apartment building,

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.026 align:middle line:90%
but just shaped in a pyramid.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.487 align:middle line:84%
So we want to know where
that photo came from.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:53.575 align:middle line:84%
So he and I had to drive down
to LA to pick up his jet car.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:56.202 align:middle line:84%
And we picked up a jet
car, then drove over

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.122 align:middle line:84%
to Jet Propulsion
Laboratories in Pasadena.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:08:59.956 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: JPL.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.583 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Just like
we own the place.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.836 align:middle line:84%
Parked in visitor parking
and took up the whole space

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:08.757 align:middle line:84%
with my truck and his 20 foot
jet car, walked up in there,

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:13.178 align:middle line:84%
and asked to see Bob Nathan,
who was head of Viking Imaging.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.722 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like
everything was planned.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle line:90%
They said, oh, yeah.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.348 align:middle line:90%
Just a second.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.976 align:middle line:84%
Then they ushered us up
to Bob Nathan's office.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:20.852 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:24.105 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And Bob and I sit there
and start talking with him.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:28.276 align:middle line:84%
And we told him that we
were aware of the two photos

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that the two guys had
found-- that everybody

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.529 align:middle line:90%
sees the pyramids.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:34.365 align:middle line:84%
But Bob had worked at a
classified base, where

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:38.745 align:middle line:84%
he had seen pictures
of a pyramid in Cydonia

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.997 align:middle line:84%
that was very
detailed and showed

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.708 align:middle line:84%
doors, and windows,
and balconies, and all

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:90%
that type of stuff.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And we said, were those in
the original Viking series

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:90%
of photographs?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.634 align:middle line:90%
Did we miss it?

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.093 align:middle line:90%
Or did the two guys miss it?

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.637 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:59.307 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
where those came from.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:03.436 align:middle line:84%
So we said, you know, you're
head of Viking Imaging.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.648 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that you would
have that kind of information.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.691 align:middle line:84%
When he said they weren't
in the original series,

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:14.614 align:middle line:84%
we asked him, did
the orbiter camera--

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:84%
did it ever go
into a lower orbit?

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.537 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes, it did, but
we didn't take any pictures.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.206 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we had to
laugh because that's

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:27.502 align:middle line:84%
exactly how security works
is you take the top guy who

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:30.588 align:middle line:84%
has contact with
the public and you

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.173 align:middle line:90%
don't tell him what's going on.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.967 align:middle line:84%
Even though he's
the head of imaging,

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.511 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't know that
they took pictures.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So those pictures
that Bob saw at S4

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.932 align:middle line:84%
were taken when they went
into the lower orbit.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.685 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the two races there
on Mars that have been fighting

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.894 align:middle line:90%
for a while--

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:45.979 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Hundreds of years.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.605 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they the
ones who destroyed Mars?

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:48.523 align:middle line:90%
Because Mars--

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:48.648 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.399 align:middle line:90%
There was a--

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.441 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There's a huge--

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.819 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: --a large
accident there,

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.195 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
how it happened.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:54.988 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.157 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: We sent up
the Rover series.

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I just happened to be
taking a remote viewing

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.621 align:middle line:84%
class with Angela
Smith Davis, who's

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:06.124 align:middle line:84%
one of the leading remote
viewers in the United States,

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.584 align:middle line:90%
and she had a class.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.627 align:middle line:84%
And I had a week off,
so I took the class.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:13.506 align:middle line:84%
So the first day we show up
happened to be the exact day--

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.799 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Rover landing.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:15.758 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Rover landing.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:19.929 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And they were
showing the twin peaks

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:24.017 align:middle line:84%
in the very, very distant
what was going on.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.685 align:middle line:84%
She was a little late
coming into class.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.061 align:middle line:84%
She said the reason
I was late is

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.397 align:middle line:84%
I was with my husband
watching these photos.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.775 align:middle line:84%
And he works up at
Groom Lake, and he's

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:84%
in charge of those
rovers and taking

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.699 align:middle line:84%
care of how they move back
and forth and everything.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:44.329 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw those pictures,
he says, That's not Mars.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.164 align:middle line:84%
That's out in Death
Valley, where we work.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly where they are.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.833 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.753 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So that tipped
us off that the Rover

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:52.629 align:middle line:90%
wasn't going to Mars.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:53.421 align:middle line:90%
Never has been.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:84%
And every picture
we've seen of Mars

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.759 align:middle line:90%
is taken someplace on Earth.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
The guy that was in charge
of distributing the motor--

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.348 align:middle line:84%
the Mars pictures--
used to be Malin.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.683 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not sure if he--

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:08.394 align:middle line:84%
Malin Space Systems--
still does it,

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.563 align:middle line:90%
but he was the original guy.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason he got to
be in charge of that is he

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.071 align:middle line:84%
was once a very big
Billy Meier proponent.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:18.863 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.699 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And the only
way to stop him was to--

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.869 align:middle line:84%
because he was so knowledgeable
and they couldn't say, oh,

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.746 align:middle line:90%
it's just some kook, you know?

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:32.460 align:middle line:84%
They gave him a contract
to vet the Mars photos,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.547 align:middle line:84%
and that's how Malin Space
Systems came into being,

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:45.014 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the guy, Malin,
got separated from promoting

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.933 align:middle line:90%
the Billy Meier photos.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:47.725 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:48.518 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.312 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The way they hide
that's stuff from the public

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:90%
is ingenious, you know?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.065 align:middle line:84%
They spend a lot of
time figuring out

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:57.735 align:middle line:84%
how to keep the rank and file,
you and me, from knowing what's

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:59.696 align:middle line:84%
going on or knowing
what's really going on.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:00.488 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:03.366 align:middle line:84%
The only way is to-- like I
always tell everybody, go out

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.575 align:middle line:90%
and find out for yourself.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:05.702 align:middle line:90%
And that's you and Bob did.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.495 align:middle line:90%
You went right to the source.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:10.081 align:middle line:84%
Are these beings on
Mars intelligent?

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:10.873 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:11.708 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.544 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how far more
advanced are they than we are,

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:15.378 align:middle line:90%
would you say?

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.839 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well, they can shoot
down anything we put up there,

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:21.009 align:middle line:84%
so I imagine they're
pretty far advanced.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:24.303 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they're as far advanced

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.806 align:middle line:84%
as the humans on the
moon, but everything's

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:90%
more advanced than us.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.683 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:29.767 align:middle line:90%
Is it habitable?

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Yes, it has a
breathable atmosphere.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.734 align:middle line:84%
And it's not red like NASA
would have us believe.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.485 align:middle line:90%
And there's plenty of water.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:43.531 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there any
Earth humans on Mars?

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.407 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: I don't know.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:44.615 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Don't know.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.743 align:middle line:90%
Can't verify that.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:50.913 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: If we went there, we
didn't go under our own power.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.123 align:middle line:90%
ET took us there.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:52.915 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.709 align:middle line:90%
And let's jump to the next one.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.335 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Before we
jump to the next one,

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:58.796 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make a statement
here about disclosure.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:01.841 align:middle line:84%
You know, you and I talk about
a lot of different things

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:05.344 align:middle line:84%
and people want to know, when
are they going to tell us?

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.805 align:middle line:90%
They're never going to tell us.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:11.017 align:middle line:84%
And if they did, what
would they tell us?

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:14.103 align:middle line:84%
You and I know more than they
would ever tell on disclosure.

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
A guy that read most of
this stuff that comes out

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.819 align:middle line:84%
in the bookstore would know
more than they'd ever tell us.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So why would you
want the Pentagon

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.784 align:middle line:84%
to say, OK, we're going
to have a disclosure here.

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.077 align:middle line:90%
What would they tell us?

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:29.911 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, you know?

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.287 align:middle line:90%
Nothing that we couldn't know.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.705 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But then
again, you and I

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.249 align:middle line:84%
are sitting here
talking about disclosure

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.376 align:middle line:84%
and informing people
what's really going on

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.795 align:middle line:90%
and telling the truth.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.214 align:middle line:84%
As far as the
government, you know,

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.008 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be the
government that discloses.

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
It's more going to be like
the people, if anything.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.763 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.307 align:middle line:84%
You can learn far
more on your own

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.975 align:middle line:84%
than the government
would ever tell you.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:54.393 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Exactly.

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:55.478 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Watch this series.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.979 align:middle line:84%
It's the closest
you're going to get

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.232 align:middle line:90%
to disclosure in your lifetime.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.066 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:07.406 align:middle line:84%
As far as where Uranus,
Neptune, and Pluto are,

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:10.118 align:middle line:84%
are you telling me there's
more plants beyond that?

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.077 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:14.664 align:middle line:84%
There's 39 total and they go
out much farther than Pluto.

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And are there any
in between Pluto and Earth?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.793 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Probably.

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:19.168 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.128 align:middle line:90%
Probably.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.796 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The only one
I know a little bit

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.757 align:middle line:84%
about is the one that orbited
between Jupiter and Mars

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.135 align:middle line:90%
was a planet called M-A-N, Man.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:32.014 align:middle line:10%
Lou Baldin wrote a book and
described the fantastic society

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:32.807 align:middle line:10%
that was there.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.268 align:middle line:84%
I think there was 100
billion people there.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.436 align:middle line:90%
They had tremendous innovations.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Their buildings were made of
gold and silver and highways

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.275 align:middle line:90%
of diamonds.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.485 align:middle line:90%
It was really something.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:49.824 align:middle line:84%
That plan did not fit into the
agenda that the serpents had,

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and the serpents, I've told
you, are the head of everything

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.873 align:middle line:90%
that goes on in this universe.

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.167 align:middle line:84%
At least those that
have a physical body.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:05.173 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: On the echelon of all
the entities and ETs out there,

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.757 align:middle line:90%
what is the top level?

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:07.592 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Serpents.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.509 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The serpents.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.095 align:middle line:84%
And the reptilians
are below them.

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.221 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: They're below them.

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:15.057 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And then everyone else
is below that, pretty much.

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:19.437 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And the reptilians
infest every single planet

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.105 align:middle line:90%
to some extent.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:26.235 align:middle line:84%
The serpents sit back and run
things from their position.

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:28.029 align:middle line:90%
And for some reason--

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.614 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know the reason--

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:33.409 align:middle line:84%
planet Man was not in their
agenda and they blew it up.

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:37.246 align:middle line:84%
It took them 1.5
seconds to eliminate

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.999 align:middle line:84%
a planet that was two
times as big as Earth

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.792 align:middle line:90%
with 100 billion people.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:46.923 align:middle line:84%
And in 1.5 seconds, nothing was
left except the asteroid belt.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.634 align:middle line:84%
All the stuff we-- gold and
stuff we find on the surface

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.885 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth, that's from--

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:51.677 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Partial.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: That's from planet Man.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.931 align:middle line:84%
That's stuff that's
been falling down.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:58.309 align:middle line:84%
And all of the meteor showers
that we have each year--

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.311 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
like 10 of them--

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:02.813 align:middle line:84%
different type meteor-- those
come from the planet Man

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.316 align:middle line:84%
disintegrating, or
as it disintegrated.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:10.695 align:middle line:84%
And when we meet that
particular part of Man,

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:14.075 align:middle line:90%
it rains down on the Earth.

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.992 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: John, what's
this on the line we hear

00:17:15.992 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:90%
about this Planet X or Nibiru.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.499 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Emery, I don't know
anything about Planet X.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:23.917 align:middle line:84%
It could be some
other planets that we

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:26.253 align:middle line:84%
don't know that are in orbit--
they're going to come by.

00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:28.256 align:middle line:84%
But I have no
information on that.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.007 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:33.844 align:middle line:84%
Of all the origin stories
out there on planet Earth,

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:37.139 align:middle line:90%
which appeals to you the most?

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:40.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The one that Lou Baldin
wrote about in his books,

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.897 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that we were just
engineered and planted here

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:48.192 align:middle line:90%
by an ET race.

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:51.946 align:middle line:84%
The Bible is pretty
much allegorical.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.867 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about the
plants and the animals

00:17:56.867 --> 00:18:01.372 align:middle line:84%
and all the different types of
flora and fauna on this planet?

00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:03.791 align:middle line:84%
Was that also
engineered by these?

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.584 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely everything.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:10.798 align:middle line:84%
Every mosquito, every
bug, every cockroach.

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yep.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.799 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Everything has
been carefully engineered

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.053 align:middle line:90%
by the serpent race.

00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:18.264 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And do they
have technologies

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:23.686 align:middle line:84%
that can heal us and also clean
up this planet since we do have

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:25.646 align:middle line:90%
a problem damaging the planet?

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.231 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The planet
Earth has been here

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.567 align:middle line:84%
for 13 billion years,
not 5, as NASA told you.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.359 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: It has seen at least 100
civilizations far more advanced

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.949 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:40.536 align:middle line:84%
And there's remnants of those
civilizations under the Sea

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:43.706 align:middle line:90%
of Japan, under the Sahara.

00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:47.293 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of remnants around,
just right under our nose.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
There's not a possibility
that we could do anything

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.799 align:middle line:90%
to damage the planet.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.552 align:middle line:84%
The carbon footprint
that we hear--

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.888 align:middle line:90%
totally BS.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.141 align:middle line:90%
Global warming, total BS.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
not a single thing

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.897 align:middle line:84%
that humans, who for
all practical purposes

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:11.275 align:middle line:84%
have only been here for
1,000 or more years,

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
could damage anything
on the planet Earth.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.407 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
know about the pyramids?

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:19.325 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.243 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: I've had a chance
to crawl up in them.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.036 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I know.

00:19:22.036 --> 00:19:24.997 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: When I was in Cairo
between 1980 and 1982,

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.292 align:middle line:84%
it was still open and we were
able to climb all the way up

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:32.296 align:middle line:84%
and walk these huge 100 ton
blocks fit within 1/10,000

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:33.464 align:middle line:90%
of an inch.

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you one thing, the
Egyptians did not build them.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.761 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.762 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who built them?

00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:40.679 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: ET built them.

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.932 align:middle line:90%
They were energy sources.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.392 align:middle line:90%
Like generators.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.978 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is they
used a sympathetic vibration

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:50.439 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth to create power.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:54.193 align:middle line:84%
And there's thousands of
pyramids all over the world.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:54.985 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:57.822 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The Appalachian
Mountains cover a bunch of them

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.198 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:02.576 align:middle line:84%
They're found more and more in
Mexico, Central America, South

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.453 align:middle line:90%
America, all over.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:07.832 align:middle line:90%
But they're all deactivated now.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.542 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
that recent discovery

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:13.421 align:middle line:84%
of the West Coast of Cuba that
they found a pyramid twice

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.381 align:middle line:90%
the size of Giza underwater?

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:18.551 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Another
indication of the hundreds

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of civilizations that have
occupied Earth over the past 13

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.848 align:middle line:90%
billion years.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.851 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I noticed recently
that the news is coming out

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:31.272 align:middle line:84%
slower and slower about the
revealing of Antarctica--

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.732 align:middle line:84%
that they may have
found something.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And how are they
going to release that?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.739 align:middle line:84%
Because that also indicates
extraterrestrial presence,

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.993 align:middle line:84%
a civilization that was
unknown to us before.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.162 align:middle line:84%
I heard they're
down there taking

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.039 align:middle line:84%
Mayan stuff and Egyptian
stuff and mixing

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:52.418 align:middle line:84%
it all up together to
discombobulate National

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.378 align:middle line:84%
Geographic scientists
when they go down

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.046 align:middle line:90%
there to first let them in.

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:59.175 align:middle line:84%
As we know, it's been
inhabited forever.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:00.217 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, whoever
occupies Antarctica

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.349 align:middle line:84%
is not one bit interested
in telling us or showing us

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.184 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.853 align:middle line:84%
They made that very
clear to the government.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:13.772 align:middle line:84%
And we are not supposed
to go down there.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:18.819 align:middle line:84%
There's a small presence,
and every once in a while

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:90%
somebody will see something.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:25.743 align:middle line:84%
For instance, C-130 crew that
Linda Moulton Howe interviewed,

00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:29.455 align:middle line:84%
and they accidentally saw
one of the huge openings

00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
where you could see
a city down in there.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.254 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want us to
know anything that went on.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:41.217 align:middle line:84%
If you'll remember that
she interviewed a crew that

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:44.011 align:middle line:84%
had been on a
scientific expedition

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:47.014 align:middle line:84%
and asked for an
emergency evacuation,

00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:50.601 align:middle line:84%
and in the evacuation when
they were in the airplane going

00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:52.311 align:middle line:90%
back, none of them--

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.189 align:middle line:84%
they stared straight
ahead, said no word.

00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:56.607 align:middle line:84%
When they got to
the destination,

00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.692 align:middle line:84%
they were stripped of all
their clothing and given

00:21:58.692 --> 00:21:59.735 align:middle line:90%
new clothing.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:01.862 align:middle line:84%
All that clothing was
bundled up and everything

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:06.033 align:middle line:84%
on that scientific
expedition was boxed and put

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:09.286 align:middle line:84%
in a different place and
the people that were on it

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:10.204 align:middle line:90%
never said a word.

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:12.873 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, even when
they got to the destination,

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
they just stared
straight ahead as

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.254 align:middle line:84%
if something happened
so horrific that they

00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:20.089 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to discuss it.

00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:22.675 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're aware of that
treaty the United Nations has

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:26.262 align:middle line:84%
that every country signs if
they want to be part of it,

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:30.641 align:middle line:84%
and in that treaty it states
that you're not allowed--

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.768 align:middle line:84%
your country is not allowed
to go to Antarctica.

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:33.852 align:middle line:90%
I heard about this.

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:34.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: I didn't know that.

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:35.688 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:35.729 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:90%
I heard about it.

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's true or not.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.775 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to investigate
that as well.

00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:40.943 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Very interesting.

00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:43.279 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why would they
put that in there, you know,

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.154 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm saying.

00:22:44.154 --> 00:22:45.239 align:middle line:90%
Another red flag.

00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:46.031 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.826 align:middle line:84%
When is the probable
date of that?

00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:49.618 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:51.287 align:middle line:90%
Was that in the '50s or--

00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:52.496 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, it was recently.

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Recently.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.372 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:53.706 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:53.706 --> 00:22:55.416 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what
happened to Buzz Aldrin?

00:22:55.416 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Why did he go down there?

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.961 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Probably out of
curiosity, but apparently

00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.338 align:middle line:90%
he became violently ill.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:08.554 align:middle line:84%
And he made a statement when he
got back that he had seen evil.

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Pure evil.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, he didn't explain that,
and I don't know what he meant,

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.227 align:middle line:90%
but he made the statement.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:18.814 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever
heard about the Pleiades

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:23.402 align:middle line:84%
and the Orion star
systems visiting us here

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:24.737 align:middle line:90%
on Earth and other planets?

00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:25.571 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We've been visited by thousands,
thousands of ET civilizations.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.372 align:middle line:84%
But when people say, well,
if I wanted to meet an alien,

00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:36.373 align:middle line:90%
how would I do that?

00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:40.127 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, just go
down to the strip there.

00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:42.171 align:middle line:84%
They hang around
the stratosphere.

00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:44.965 align:middle line:84%
And the way you can tell
is if somebody looks

00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:47.217 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit different,
like their ears are

00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:50.804 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit odd or
their nose a little bit odd,

00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:54.475 align:middle line:84%
just go behind them
and think real hard,

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:57.227 align:middle line:84%
I know you're an alien,
and they'll go like that.

00:23:57.227 --> 00:23:58.562 align:middle line:90%
They'll turn like that.

00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:00.648 align:middle line:84%
They'll be caught off guard
You'll see your alien.

00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.149 align:middle line:90%
Yes, excellent.

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:03.442 align:middle line:90%
I teach that, too.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.402 align:middle line:84%
It always-- something to
do with the cartilage.

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:08.656 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- have not
perfected with the ETs,

00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:90%
or unless they're real ETs.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just they are
off a little bit.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:90%
The eye set's off a little bit.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.702 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The noses.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.496 align:middle line:90%
The ears, always.

00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:16.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:17.623 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY:: There's something
a little bit different

00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:18.832 align:middle line:90%
and always noticeable.

00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:19.708 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:20.501 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:23.671 align:middle line:84%
John, do you think we're living
in a holographic universe?

00:24:23.671 --> 00:24:26.298 align:middle line:90%
I mean, are we in the matrix?

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.967 align:middle line:84%
Is it really us,
or are we looking

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:33.055 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes of a shell here
and our soul is somewhere else?

00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:34.682 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Emery, it's
certainly possible.

00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:37.184 align:middle line:84%
If there's unlimited
dimensions, just

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:42.773 align:middle line:84%
imagine how infinitely
possible that would be.

00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:44.108 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Infinite possibilities.

00:24:44.108 --> 00:24:44.525 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:45.317 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.694 align:middle line:90%
That's what I always say.

00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:49.905 align:middle line:84%
John, have you been exposed
to any parallel universes

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:52.241 align:middle line:90%
or interdimensional universes?

00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:54.284 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know,
to the extent that--

00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:57.162 align:middle line:84%
I've read of all of
Lou Baldin's books

00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about how
many dimensions there are.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.294 align:middle line:84%
When we leave Earth, we go
to the fourth dimension.

00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:06.463 align:middle line:84%
We can live there are
a couple of lifetimes

00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:09.216 align:middle line:84%
and then we can go to
the fifth dimension.

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:11.635 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we ask, well,
what's the fifth dimension

00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:14.221 align:middle line:90%
look like or feel like?

00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:17.141 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you don't even know
what the third dimension looks

00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:19.643 align:middle line:84%
like, so how can I explain
the fifth dimension?

00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:20.686 align:middle line:90%
The fact that you can't--

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:23.230 align:middle line:84%
But I said, so Caleb,
that sounds interesting.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.732 align:middle line:90%
How many dimensions are there?

00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:26.066 align:middle line:90%
And he said, infinite.

00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:28.277 align:middle line:84%
So if the dimensions
are infinite,

00:25:28.277 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
just imagine how complex
that is and how that fits in

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.951 align:middle line:90%
with parallel universes.

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:90%
You know, our universe--

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.206 align:middle line:84%
we're told that it all
started with the big bang

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:42.958 align:middle line:90%
19 billion years ago.

00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.376 align:middle line:90%
That's totally false.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.794 align:middle line:90%
There was no big bang.

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:46.587 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:48.172 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: There was
no dark energy.

00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:50.591 align:middle line:90%
That's all total BS.

00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:52.926 align:middle line:84%
The universe has
been here forever.

00:25:52.926 --> 00:25:56.138 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't accept that--
if you say like most people,

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:57.514 align:middle line:90%
well, somebody had to build it--

00:25:57.514 --> 00:25:59.767 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] well,
that's your choice

00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:01.435 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
believe that, but it

00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:03.937 align:middle line:84%
would be easier
if you just accept

00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
that it's been here forever and
it's going to be here forever.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.483 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:26:07.483 --> 00:26:10.694 align:middle line:84%
And we're not at a high
enough IQ in consciousness

00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:15.073 align:middle line:84%
to grasp what really
did happen, and that's

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:18.744 align:middle line:84%
the other point we
must get out there.

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:22.372 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have to, just
like you said, live our lives--

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.458 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: With integrity,
without any hate or greed.

00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:25.459 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:26.794 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:26:26.794 --> 00:26:28.378 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: That's our only choice.

00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:32.758 align:middle line:84%
And if you accept that,
you'll get along a lot quicker

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.302 align:middle line:84%
than if you think you
have to figure things out,

00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:37.971 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
going to figure it out.

00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
ET and the government
spend untold resources

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:43.685 align:middle line:90%
to confuse you.

00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:44.478 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:26:44.478 --> 00:26:47.689 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: They have the
Dracos, and this thing,

00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:51.568 align:middle line:84%
and those guys there, and the
Orions and everything else.

00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:54.029 align:middle line:84%
It's just to confuse
you to keep you

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.614 align:middle line:90%
from figuring out the truth.

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:57.783 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's such an
effort to do that.

00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you're
going to overcome that.

>> At Fort Gordon, Georgia.

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:05.225 align:middle line:10%
