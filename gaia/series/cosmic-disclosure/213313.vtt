00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.505 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, we spoke about
these ice tunnels in Antarctica.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Did they find any crafts?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They
found several crafts.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.545 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: On top of the ice,
below the ice, in the water,

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:48.345 align:middle line:90%
where?

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:50.012 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: In the
cavern, and I was just

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
talking about that they
don't want to talk about,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.730 align:middle line:90%
they found a craft.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And at first, they thought
it had been trapped there

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
or it got in there and couldn't
get out because ironically,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
these caverns are
like huge spheres

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't find initially
couldn't find a way out.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We could see him
from the outside,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and we penetrated it by
drilling holes or something.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how we got in.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we got in there,
and we see a craft in there.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And this craft is rather large.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I think something in the
neighborhood of 20 meters

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
in diameter, which
is about what?

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:90%
60 feet or 66 feet.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But when they first
found this, they thought,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is a home, number
one, or it was trapped here

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
because there's no way out.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But then they figured
that there are ways out

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:90%
that they could open.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
craft that they found.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't get
it out of there.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But we did manage to
get inside the craft.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
occupants in the craft.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But we knew the species because
we had a craft just like that.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:90%
We found--

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we had a
similar craft back home.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: That had crashed
in Montana some years,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:90%
many years before.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.815 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same type of craft.

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What kind
of species was this?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I don't know.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
They never identified
it in the report.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the log, they
described the inside of it?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They
described the inside

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
as two sitting positions
with no controls whatsoever.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no knobs,
buttons, switches.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So the occupants would
sit in these seats,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and they would be in like a
cocoon that would go over them.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And how they flew the craft,
it was never explained,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:90%
but there wasn't any knobs.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.908 align:middle line:84%
But there was a screen,
a display screen.

00:02:48.908 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't on, and they couldn't
figure out how to turn it on.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't know that
they ever figured out

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:90%
how to get that out of there.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The last I heard that
it was still there.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.527 align:middle line:84%
Now we have recovered
crafts on the ice.

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Tell us about that one.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: One of
the later expeditions

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
that mapped the
surface of the ice

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
from the South Pole out
located a craft that

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:84%
was on the ice in a very remote
location under a mound of snow,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%
almost like a mountain.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was partially
under there.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So they thought, number
one, it was either being

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
hidden by the extraterrestrials,
or it had crashed there,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
although there was no
outward physical damage,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:90%
or they just left it there.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And when they finally
got in inside,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
they realized it was empty.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And again, there was
no way of determining

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:90%
how this they could fly it.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: But they did manage
to get a ship down there,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:90%
a United States Navy ship.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.458 align:middle line:90%
And they towed this thing--

00:03:58.458 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: --for about
60 miles to the ocean.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.145 align:middle line:90%
And what they found--

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
This was an admiral,
the admiral who I talked

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:90%
about before on this program.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
He says that they figured out
that this thing, as enormous

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:90%
as it was, could float.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So as they got it into
the water, they towed it.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And they towed it to
different locations.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they got it
back to the United States.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I think they went
to Australia first

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually, somehow,
they got it to the United States

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
in one of the big cargo ships.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But again, they think
it was left there

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:90%
for some particular reasons.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists who examined the
ship decided that that's been

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:90%
there for maybe 1,000 years.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.033 align:middle line:84%
They just left it there
for some particular reason.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
come back and use it.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, we figured
out how to turn things on.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they did that.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And once it was out to Area
51, at one of the locations

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
out there, we managed whether
we had assistance from somebody,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
how they did that.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
they actually were

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
able to turn on
the communications

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:90%
or the electrical system.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there any
other craft besides that one

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:90%
that you can talk about?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, there was one
other that had crashed that they

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:90%
found--

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:90%
but we didn't actually find it.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
The British exploration
team found it.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a very remote
location in the mountains

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
of the South Pole.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And aircrafts had flown
over that area several times

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:90%
and saw some kind of anomaly.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Silvery thing down there.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But because it was
such a remote area,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
it took some time,
days and days,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to get a land exploration
team to that site.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:90%
The British finally got there.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I think this was like in
the mid '80s time frame.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.158 align:middle line:90%
Don't quote me on that.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:58.958 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Recent.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Very recent.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And found this
thing, and it had crashed.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole front or one
section was totally damaged.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And when they got in there,
they found decayed bodies.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they figured out
because of that, they crashed.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What type of race?

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Greys.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Greys.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It wasn't
the even Greys.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:90%
It was the other Greys.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they recovered
everything but the craft

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
because there wasn't any way to
get a huge crane or construction

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:84%
equipment out there to
remove this thing because it

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:90%
was so big.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So they did get a lot of the
equipment, the artifacts,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:90%
and the bodies out of there.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the
bodies were decayed.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And they shipped them back to,
as far as I know, to Area 51.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.998 align:middle line:90%
And that's the only ones.

00:06:47.998 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Any other
beings that you're

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
aware of that were either
captured or found dead?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: A United States
Marine Corps team encountered

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.495 align:middle line:90%
beings, and that case--

00:07:00.495 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Underground?

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: No, above ground.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.283 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Above ground, OK.

00:07:03.283 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They were doing
some kind of operation.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it was a
test or they were training,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and they encountered
these 15 small beings that

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
were gray in color,
but they had suits on.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the cold
affected them too

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
because they had something
like warm suits on.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Heavy, heavy, heavy helmets.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But they were only
about 4 feet tall.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:90%
They encountered him.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:84%
They had a
confrontation with him.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Two Marines were killed.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
beings were injured,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and they were left there
when another team came in,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:90%
I believe, of Marines.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But the report said, just
another team, Americans,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
all the beings were gone
except for those two beings

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:90%
that the Marines had killed.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we had those that we
took back, and that's it.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.673 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know how
the Marines were killed?

00:07:59.673 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: They were burned.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
They were burned in
something I think

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
they called a laser or
some kind of burning device

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:90%
that burned through their body.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
They had to burn holes
into their bodies.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And those Marines
were transported

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to a special laboratory and
then to Armed Forces Institute

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
of Pathology in
Washington for autopsies

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
to try to determine
whether this was

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.303 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a laser or
some other weapon system.

00:08:25.303 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So let's talk more
about the confrontation,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Richard.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.335 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
Marines were there.

00:08:29.335 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
15 of these 4-foot
tall beings were there.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
They were armed, obviously.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.578 align:middle line:84%
And you said there was, you
know, something broke out there.

00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything more in the
report you could elaborate on?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.912 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, there
was a confrontation.

00:08:43.912 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The Marines obviously
weren't briefed,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
prepared to encounter

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial beings.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And we later found out they
were extraterrestrial beings.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:90%
So there was a confrontation.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
We fired first, and I believe
they defended themselves.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
deaths on both sides.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Tragic.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: At that point, the
Marines retreated to a location

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
where their vehicles were
at and notified the command

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%
station and then another team.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure what this
other team was made up,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
whether they were other Marines
or was there an Air Force

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
contingent, because
there a lot of Air Force

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
down there at that time period,
whether they were Air Force,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:90%
military, police, or what.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.657 align:middle line:84%
But when they got back,
they found the two.

00:09:32.657 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the Marines
recovered their own bodies,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:90%
their own comrades.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But there were these
two beings still there.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know, I don't know
that there was ever explained

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:90%
where the other 13 beings went.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because there
wasn't a craft there.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It was just them out in
the open, on the ice there.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Probably doing the
same thing we do, exploring

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there was some
entryway way that they had.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's even another
story because we did

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:90%
find some portals down there.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:90%
But they got away someway.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:90%
But they left there too.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.902 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of odd because
we never left military.

00:10:15.902 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course not.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: When I was
in a regular military,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.985 align:middle line:84%
we would never leave
our people behind.

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We would eventually
get them, maybe not

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
during the actual fight,
but we would eventually

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
recover our dead.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were going
to, and there was too much

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:90%
opposing force there.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't
know how they think.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:90%
But we recovered them.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:90%
But they were dead.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:90%
The ETs were dead.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And to the best of my knowledge,
they were humanoid in a way

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:90%
that they were biologics.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
But then again, I don't
know the full examination.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they went back
someplace and were examined too.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.017 align:middle line:84%
But they could have
been robots, right?

00:10:56.017 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They could have been
programmed life forms or--

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Programmed life forms.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.312 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
sometimes, when they leave

00:11:01.312 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:84%
bodies like that, it's not
an emotional love thing,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
like a family
member or a comrade.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But then again, we're just
hypothetically speaking.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Richard, come on now.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.778 align:middle line:90%
You threw in portals there.

00:11:14.778 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
The audience is going to want
to know a little bit more

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
What portals are
down there that they

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:84%
may have gone through to get
out of that dangerous situation?

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, I can't
connect the portals

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
with the disappearance of
those 13 extraterrestrials.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But a scientific
team, not military,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:84%
but a scientific team
made up of some British

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and some American
expedition personnel,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
scientists were exploring a
certain area of Antarctica,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:90%
the mountainous area.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:90%
They were flown in.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.100 align:middle line:84%
This is when they
were able to bring

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
in helicopters that could fly
in that kind of environment.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And while they were flying
to these different locations,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
taking soil samples
and things like that,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:90%
they saw this strange circle.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And they thought it was just
a natural phenomena of the ice

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:90%
or the way it melted.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:90%
It was in a hill area.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And as they walked up to
it, the two scientists

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:90%
had actually got up close to it.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
They realized it wasn't
something that was created

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:90%
by wind or the environment.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It was something that appeared
to them to be manmade,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:90%
like an arc or a ring.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And as they got
closer to it, they

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
noticed that there
were symbols on it.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was about 10 to
12-foot high in diameter.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they thought,
what could this be?

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.563 align:middle line:84%
And as they looked
at the symbols,

00:12:40.563 --> 00:12:42.230 align:middle line:84%
they realized that
there wasn't anything

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:90%
that they'd ever recognized.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the scientists,
there was two scientists,

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and one was British,
and one was American.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:84%
As they looked at
it, they decided, ah,

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:90%
this isn't from Earth.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't think
either one of them

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.020 align:middle line:84%
had ever been briefed in
any kind of UFO matters.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But they recognized them
to be not from Earth.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why
they figured that.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So as they thought, they wanted
to go through, just walk through

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:90%
and look at the other side.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.635 align:middle line:84%
As they walk through this, a
bluish atmosphere was created.

00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And encompassed them.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.117 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Encompassed them.

00:13:23.117 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And each of them
were in a sphere

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:90%
that they couldn't move in.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And as they tried to
move, where they opened up

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:90%
in what they called a paradise.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It was green hills,
plush meadows.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
that they had died.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
still see each other

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and were aware of
each other or no?

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They were-- Yeah,
they were aware of each other.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And they realized, oh,
my God, we just died,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:90%
and this is Heaven.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
And this is what they wrote.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But as they moved
around, they realized

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:90%
they could touch and see things.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we're in heaven.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
But as they turned around,
they see this ring behind them.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they kind of panicked
in a way and thought,

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:90%
well, we better get back.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So as they walked through
it, same thing appears.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
There were a bluish
atmosphere, enclosed them,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and they moved through, and they
ended up back in Antarctica.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So now they knew this was
something they'd never

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:90%
experienced before.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously
they, they marked

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
this place, and the other
members that were with them

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:84%
but farther back that
were doing other testing

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:90%
saw them disappear.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And they immediately said,
where the heck did you guys go?

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
walked through that,

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.493 align:middle line:90%
and we were in another place.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they know
how long they were gone?

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Real time?

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.767 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: It was real time.

00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't days, or
months, or years.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.088 align:middle line:84%
It was maybe minutes
or something.

00:15:04.088 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's great confirmation
though that the team members

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
actually saw them bleed
into this nothingness.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:90%
They watched them do it.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.092 align:middle line:84%
And they said, where
did you guys go?

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They thought they fell down,
but they didn't go after him.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:84%
They had, I think,
reason enough for,

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
common sense enough that
if they disappeared,

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to disappear.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:90%
But they saw them come out.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said when they saw them
come out, they were all blue.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So a doctor was with
this exploratory team.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%
They quickly examined them.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:84%
The assessment, a
quick assessment.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't seem to
be injured in any way.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So they did their work around
there, and then they left.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Now a few weeks or
some time later,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:84%
another team came
in with those two--

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Same guys.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The two guys and
another team, to explore this.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And they did all sorts of
scientific calculations

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:90%
and before they entered it.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the two men
went in, and then the two

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
other scientists
came after them.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to go in together.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Two one end, and the other
two had a movie camera,

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and they went in.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So they recorded
the entrance into--

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fantastic.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And once they're in
there, they spent a lot of time

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Hours, and hours, and hours.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that what they
were experiencing and seeing

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a different location.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.990 align:middle line:84%
It was the same location, but
it was thousands, and thousands,

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years--

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Different time.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, in the past.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And then there were a
lot of other experiments

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that done there, but that
was one of several portals

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
they found.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
any other what they

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:90%
found in the other portals.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm stealing some of
this from Linda Moulton Howe.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I have to give
her credit for it.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But there were other
portals that were found,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and there were tests
and experiments

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
done in those other portals.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But there were different
locations around Antarctica.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they see that
location, like was there

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:90%
anything special about it?

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Was it on a ley line?

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Where was there a craft
underneath or a base?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Did anything ever come up later
on about this special location?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: No.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
I was told and read

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:90%
was that it was a paradise.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It was like a paradise.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, OK, maybe
20, 50, 100,000 years ago,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica did have plush,
green grass and trees.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I almost forgot,
they found a fruit tree.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
They found a tree with
some kind of fruit on it.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And they brought that fruit
back with them and analyzed it.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.318 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't anything
they'd ever seen before.

00:17:47.318 --> 00:17:48.118 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:17:48.118 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And I don't
know the full examination

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
of that piece of fruit, but
they brought other things back.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Bark.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.455 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Any creatures?

00:17:57.455 --> 00:18:00.252 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Never found any
creatures that I know of.

00:18:00.252 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there other
technologies discovered there?

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: There was a
settlement that was found.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.867 align:middle line:84%
This was back probably in
the late '60s or early '70s.

00:18:10.867 --> 00:18:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A different area.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: A different
area by the French.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
French exploration team
found this settlement.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And they first thought it was
a settlement that somebody had

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
been down there maybe
back in the early 1900s.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But the more they uncovered
it, uncovered the snow,

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
uncovered the settlement, they
realized that the technology

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
that was there didn't match the
1900s or probably doesn't even

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
match the 21st or 22nd
or 23rd centuries.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
There were technologies,
and instruments, and just

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:84%
chairs that were made of things
that they couldn't figure out

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:90%
how they were made.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And another thing, they couldn't
ever move any of these objects.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.088 align:middle line:90%
They were so deep--

00:18:58.088 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like embedded
into the rock?

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Exactly.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Embedded into the rock.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Embedded into the soil.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Embedded into the snow and ice.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
They could never move
any of these things.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
They had to cut some things off
with diamond drills and saws

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:84%
to get them out of there, to
take them back to explore,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:90%
to find out what they were.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But that's the only
technology that I've

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:84%
heard that they
found down there that

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:90%
was probably extraterrestrial.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
There was probably
a base at some time.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And all these items and
artifacts that were left there

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact,
extraterrestrial nature.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how did they
come to that conclusion

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that it was
extraterrestrial and not

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
just an old settlement from back
in the day, in prehistoric times

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
maybe?

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, I don't think
they've ever determined that.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that what I read was
that the structures of these

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
items that were there, the
devices and the items left there

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:84%
didn't match anything that we
had in current time because that

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
would have been
the 20th century.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
find anything that

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.002 align:middle line:84%
could have been created or
manufactured prior to that.

00:20:07.002 --> 00:20:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Now there's also this
theory that maybe millions,

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and millions, and millions,
and millions of years

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
ago, there was a civilization on
Earth that did create something

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
like this, and this was
from that civilization.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
That's maybe 900 million years
ago or something like that.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like
Atlantis or something.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:90%
But that's all I know.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything in
more details than that.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: As the ice continues
to melt in Antarctica,

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
will be revealed?

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Wow.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be a lot revealed.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, yes indeed.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.075 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Over the years--

00:20:41.075 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Now the ice in Alaska, as I
was told in the last 30 years,

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:90%
dropped about 6 feet.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's 6 feet of
ice that's melted,

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and that's a lot of water.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's
going to happen is--

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a massive amount
of ice down there.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It's going to raise
the ocean, number one.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it's going to reveal
things hidden under the snow

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that we might not
want to know about.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Or there's going to be
aliens, extraterrestrials

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that realize that they have
something down there that they

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:90%
don't want us to see.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And they may do something
or project something

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:90%
that will be detrimental to us.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And the bases there
at the South Pole.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.217 align:middle line:84%
And that was told
to me by an admiral.

00:21:29.217 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I heard the same
thing from an admiral.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Also I heard there's
a craft that's there.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very large.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And it is starting to
stick out of the ice.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And that they are
now, our government

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:84%
is cloaking it with some
three-dimensional holographic

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.103 align:middle line:84%
imaging, but they can't
stop the ice melt.

00:21:48.103 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now that's
one thing they can't do,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.298 align:middle line:90%
is stop the ice from melting.

00:21:51.298 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
mysteries can you

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:90%
tell us about Antarctica?

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: There are many,
many, many, many mysteries.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
There's pockets of
empty space, as I

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:84%
was told, where you're in a
very cold environment, 30, 40,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:90%
50 degrees below zero.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But as these explorers
are walking on the ice,

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:84%
they find these
pockets of warm air.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
They get into it,
and they actually

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%
measured these temperatures.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
pockets of this warm air,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and these pockets
I'm talking about

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
are spheres and
meters and meters

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:90%
in diameter that they walk into.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And they suddenly become
very, very, very, very warm.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And they get out
the thermometer,

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:90%
and they measure this.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of these places are 50
to 60, 70 degrees in Fahrenheit

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
or up to as much as
30 degrees centigrade.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, how can that happen?

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:90%
That's an anomaly.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.010 align:middle line:84%
There's no underground
vents that they could see.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And if there were,
that would be melted.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
The snow would be
melted under there.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's an anomaly.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we
could ever understand.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
There's also anti-gravity
areas down there

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that-- the helicopters
found those.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
As they're flying
through, they suddenly

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
get in a place that
doesn't have any gravity.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And it upsets the
aerodynamics of a helicopter.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And what they've done, because
they found these places,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:84%
they map them, and they
put the coordinates,

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and they avoid those areas.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And so how do you explain that.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And finally, there's caverns
that seem to go on forever.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can't figure
out what they are.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They've sent sleds down
there with cameras on them.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And they would go miles, and
miles, and miles, and miles,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:90%
and miles, and miles.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd take five to
six hours to get them back.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, basic math, and I'm a
teacher, the speed of the craft,

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you can determine
how far that it goes.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
about miles and miles,

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and they can't find
an end of these.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There's no end, right.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They're not so
much portals or stargates.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.480 align:middle line:90%
They're just tunnels in the ice.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know what they're
made of or how they're made

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:90%
and where the end is.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's many of
those around them.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Not just one, but
there's many and many.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.707 align:middle line:84%
And that's just some of
the anomalies that I know.

00:24:27.707 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Richard, are those
tunnels going straight down,

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:90%
or horizontal, or at an angle?

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They're more
shafts than tunnels.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't go all
the way down, directly down.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
They're more or
less in an angle.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.540 align:middle line:90%
They're shafts.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:90%
But they do eventually go down.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the
sleds that they create,

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that they built for these with
cameras and lights on them,

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.702 align:middle line:84%
they don't find anything
in these tunnels

00:24:56.702 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
because they have cameras,
and they're looking,

00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:90%
and they're recording.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:90%
They lit up.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:90%
They have lights.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But they don't find
anything in there.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So what's the use or
what's the purpose of them?

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
figured that out.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.278 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I hope
next time we have you on,

00:25:11.278 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Richard, we're going to
have all those answers,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and that'll be really
interesting to find out what's

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.187 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of these tunnels.

00:25:17.187 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I'll do my best
to get those answers for you.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Thank
you so much, Richard,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:90%
for being on the show.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Thank you.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:90%
