00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Welcome
back to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and I'm here

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:10%
with our guest Emery
Smith with deeper insights

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:10%
into his extraterrestrial
coworkers.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.964 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks, Dave.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: This is one of
the most fascinating topics

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of your testimony as
far as I'm concerned

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's one thing to
have a specimen that's dead.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.147 align:middle line:84%
And as you said
before, you didn't

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
know whether these were really
extraterrestrials or not,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I had no clue.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What could be
an example of something

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
where you knew that it
was an extraterrestrial?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Were there any cases where it
was certain that it was not

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:90%
a genetically modified being?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after a few years in
the projects and your clearance

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.132 align:middle line:84%
gets up and you're getting
briefed on different scenarios

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and different types
of extraterrestrials,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
where they're saying they're
extraterrestrials or beings

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
from other than Earth origin,
and also getting access

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:84%
to the most amazing
libraries of encyclopedias

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:90%
that they have there--

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:84%
it's all on computer
mainframes--

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
you get to really
understand that we're just

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
a small, small part of
such a wide and vast array

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
of other beings that are
spread out through the universe

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and multiverse.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if we could
take off in a ship

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and start going to
other star systems,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
how common would it
be to find planets

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
with inhabited
intelligent life on them?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Is it seldom the case?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it sort of half and half?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Is it mostly the case,
or is it almost always

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
the case that a
given solar system

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.775 align:middle line:84%
will have some intelligent
beings living in it?

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The best
way I could put

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that is if I were to ask you
if you jumped into the ocean,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
how many different
species would you

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
find amongst just
jumping into one ocean?

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.294 align:middle line:84%
So it's that vast and
there's that many beings.

00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
There's unimaginable amount
of beings of different races.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you could then
say that pretty much any star

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
system we would go to,
unless there was really

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
horrible conditions
or something,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.562 align:middle line:84%
is going to have beings
that have set up shop there

00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:90%
and have civilizations?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.631 align:middle line:84%
This is what people
don't understand,

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
because beings don't need
a planet to survive on.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
They have already
mastered to make

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
their own planets and their
own space stations to live on.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are some beings that
never touch a planet but they

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.755 align:middle line:84%
travel around, of course,
because their own craft

00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
or ships that are hundreds
of miles in diameter

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:84%
can actually reproduce living
conditions such as a planet,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.485 align:middle line:84%
such as an ocean, such as an
island, such as growing food.

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When we were talking
about your extraterrestrial

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
coworkers before you had
mentioned this probably more

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:90%
benevolent Reptilian race.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You'd mentioned they were in
a constellation called Bootes.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Could we discuss a
little more about that?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Like, if we went to their star
system, what would we see?

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well you would see
a lot of traffic, number one,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
in this area
because there's just

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of races that live
in this sector of space.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But the one I was talking about
has a type of Death Star look

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It's man-made, and they have
craft on these space stations

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:90%
that look like meteorites.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And they can be up to 30
miles long, some of these.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And they can also be as small as
a compact 24-foot U-Haul truck.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot
of families there.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
They raise their
children on these things.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
They get educated there,
they graduate just

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in a few years of life
and have a higher IQ

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
than we do, just in two or
three years, these children.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:84%
They also have a faster
healing rate than we do.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
study that healing

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:90%
rate from the Reptilians.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've seen
some of the pictures

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
on my website of me taking
the blood from alligators.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
This was a direct
correlation of what

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
we were doing to test, why can
an alligator in the Everglades

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
sustain a huge wound of another
alligator ripping its leg off?

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And then in just
a matter of weeks,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:84%
not only did it
coagulate just fine

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:84%
but it also had no infection
and sometimes grows back.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
projects I worked on

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
was actually doing
this is trying

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
to replicate the healing
factors of the genetic DNA

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.592 align:middle line:90%
of these Reptilians.

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I find it
very interesting

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
when we look at Indian
history in the Mahabharata

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and the Vedas that we have what
appears to be an evil Reptilian

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
race called Rakshasas,
but that there also

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:84%
was a benevolent Reptilian race
called Nagas that they actually

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:90%
ended up making temples out of.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
see lots and lots

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
of stone inscriptions of
what looks like humans,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
but then they have like a
Reptilian tail like a snake.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that
these benevolent Reptilian

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
ETs that you were talking
about could have been there

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
Indian civilization where

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:90%
those texts were written?

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I
100% believe that.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I know all the texts
you're talking about.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I know of the statues
that you're talking about.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I know the amulets they made of
them and some of the carvings

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So I agree that these reptilians
I'm associated with that I know

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
are this a little
bit more docile,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
hybrid-type, human-type
figures and they

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.034 align:middle line:90%
were looked up as gods.

00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now it's
also interesting

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
because Pete Peterson
did say that there

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
was a benevolent
Reptilian race as well.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And he had told me that they
were very keenly interested

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
in our religious development,
our spiritual development,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
that they were very
wise, very advanced,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and they really seemed to
want us to become ethical

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and to learn how to all
get along with each other.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah I can
concur with that.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
They do have a
religious background

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know
everything about.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're very strong
about it and they

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
do carry amulets and
jewelry that show

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:90%
their belief in this system.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:84%
They also have sometimes
special clothing

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
for certain holiday-type
things that they may wear,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
such as a scarf or a
ribbon on their arm.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And these things
celebrate this religion

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that you speak of, which
is the unity of all and one

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that they believe in.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And they believe
even though they're

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:84%
of different genetic
DNA, they also

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
believe that everyone
has their DNA.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And they believe in
the system that they

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
were kind of the first ones in
the solar system and universe

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:90%
that actually seeded it.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And over billions of
years, other formations

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:84%
of their genetic
lineage has mixed around

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and is actually
where we come from.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.511 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see
sometimes in the medical society

00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
of people saying, well,
we have the reptile part

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.764 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and this
because were associated

00:07:15.764 --> 00:07:16.930 align:middle line:90%
with an iguana or something.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's very funny that
this is all coming out

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and the questions that
you ask because I do

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:84%
believe there's a
correlation with this race

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and we might have a little
bit of that DNA in us

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.449 align:middle line:90%
to some extent.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I'm just
curious if you ever

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
heard about this
benevolent Reptilian race,

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Draco and the
very antagonistic other types

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:84%
of Reptilians that apparently
just about everybody

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:90%
was opposing.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Because this Draco seemed
to be this group that's

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to invade
and conquer just

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:84%
about every other
civilization they can find.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've never heard
them speak about that.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen any
data to support that

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:90%
from their lineage.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:84%
They do have their own belief
of where they came from as far

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:84%
as the very first Reptilians,
which I do believe probably

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
could have come from the
more Draco style, evil type

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians that
people talk about.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But I can't really
say, honestly.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.324 align:middle line:90%
I'm just speculating on that.

00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well this is a
very interesting point

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
because Pete Peterson did say
that there was a Reptilian

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:90%
diaspora.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
A diaspora is when
essentially one group that

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritually inclined group
breaks off from another group

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
because they believe that
group has become evil.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Pete said that these
benevolent Reptilians

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:84%
he spoke about
had had a diaspora

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
from a negative Reptilian
group in the past.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.526 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very interesting.

00:08:50.526 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And perhaps
the fact that they

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
might have been
hybridized with humans

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
means that maybe they would
have more compassion for us.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I believe that lineage
carries over through DNA.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah, very interesting.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back now to some of
the other extraterrestrials

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that you've had as
coworkers since that's

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:90%
our main topic on this episode.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Could you give me an
example of one race

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:21.702 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't spoken about yet
that you can share with us now?

00:09:21.702 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I can go
over a couple of races.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe I should
talk about the more

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
liquid-state planets that
are associated with ETs.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, everyone thinks
ETs are all just of the 3D

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
in this Earth-air atmosphere,
and it's not the case.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.085 align:middle line:84%
You have beings that
have to live in water

00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:90%
or come from a water planet.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
You have these
types of beings that

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:84%
come from the Pleiades system
and we call them Aquifarians.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:10%
Some of the first of
these extraterrestrials

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:10%
that live in water.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to, but
their planet is 98% water.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:90%
And they actually work in water.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
feel comfortable.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you said
they came from Sirius?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.716 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, Pleiades.

00:10:09.716 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:90%
The Pleiades System.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The Aquifarian-type
extraterrestrials,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.069 align:middle line:84%
they call them
through my experience.

00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Well this is very
interesting because there is

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:10%
a correlation with a book
by Robert Temple called "The

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:10%
Sirius Mystery" in which he
studied this particular African

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:10%
tribe that comes from Mali,
and they have this Aquifarian

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:10%
race--

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:10%
I'll use your term--

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:10%
that approached them
called the Nommo.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And they gained very precise
information about the fact

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.910 align:middle line:84%
that Sirius had a little
companion star called

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Sirius B. They had information
about the planets that

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.285 align:middle line:84%
were around it, all this
very specific stuff.

00:10:54.285 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And their legends
clearly describe these

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:90%
as aquatic humanoid beings.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really interesting
new line of inquiry.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean,
I have to comment.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our operating rooms
and centers in the bases

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
are definitely completely filled
with salt water or fresh water

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
just for this type of thing.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you would
actually do an autopsy

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in a self-contained
suit inside water?

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Underwater and
heavily weighted down

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:84%
with magnets that
keep us on the ground.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have all
the sustainable air

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.527 align:middle line:84%
through the same hoses
that I use above ground.

00:11:38.527 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Sounds like it would
be exhausting if you're fighting

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:90%
against--

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's very taxing
on the body for some reason.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's just
because being under water.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:90%
It's just even mentally taxing.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:84%
The energy or
something of the water.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like scuba
diving where you can get tired

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:90%
pretty quick.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And you do seem to use a
lot more oxygen under water,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.720 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, when we are
doing these giant autopsies

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and also looking at the craft.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Some craft have to be in a
special salt soluble water

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:90%
for them to stay intact.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.864 align:middle line:84%
Once they are turned off,
they cannot hold their shape.

00:12:21.864 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would that imply
that they could only

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:84%
portal from one ocean
to another and they

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.272 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't fly through space?

00:12:27.272 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They can
fly through space

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
because they have their own
gravitational field around them

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.127 align:middle line:90%
that encompasses the water.

00:12:35.127 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, really?

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:90%
That's bizarre.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about these
Pleiadian Aquifarians

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:90%
that you saw.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to start with a
visual description of what

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.082 align:middle line:90%
they look like.

00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well
there's many types of

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:90%
water-type extraterrestrials.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
There are some that
look like manatees,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
there are some that
look like dolphins,

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and there's even some that do
have a shape from the waist

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
down that's kind
of scaly and has

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
fins on the outer
edges of these beings.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But from the chest up, they
actually look pretty human.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now just
to be clear, these

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
are extraterrestrial live
coworkers that you're

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:90%
seeing on these bases, correct?

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.574 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:13:16.574 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I
think this is maybe

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.790 align:middle line:90%
where the mermaids come from.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I think this
mythological background

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of the history of
these sailors seeing

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
these beings could possibly have
had a base here on the planet.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of cities
that people are discovering,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:84%
but the Cabal does
not let people

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
know this, that are underground
and it wasn't because they

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:90%
were flooded.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It's because that's where they
really were, these cities.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Under the ocean, I'm sorry.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Under the ocean.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And that also proves the fact
that these extraterrestrials

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
lived here and they flourished
here at some point in time.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And I know you know a lot about
the history of the mermaids

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
extraterrestrials over in Asia.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I think they're called,
what's the name?

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.694 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Kappa, in Japan.

00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah let's talk about
that for a second.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
interesting thing which

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
was research I learned
in part from having

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
had a Japanese
girlfriend in college.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.007 align:middle line:84%
And I was already very
interested in extraterrestrials

00:14:26.007 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
by the time I was a senior
and we had this relationship.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So I found out
firsthand that they

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
had considered it
an absolute fact

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
that you could not have your
kids walk near bodies of water.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And they still to this
day have warning signs

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.340 align:middle line:84%
near the water warning
about the Kappa,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:54.520 align:middle line:84%
which the legends say is
a Reptilian aquatic being.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out of the
water and grabs kids

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and drags them into the water.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So these beings could speak
their native Japanese language.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:90%
They would make jokes.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They were often very
inappropriate and rude,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
they would make rude
noises, rude gestures.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
sarcastic and arrogant.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So do you think
these Kappa could

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
be actual extraterrestrials
that got here somehow?

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I do believe there's
some sort of correlation

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of the
stories over there.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
These descendents from
the Aquifarians, I think,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
are multiple as far
as genetics and DNA.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Just like we have a lot of
different types of humans here,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and over millions
and millions of years

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
we have spread
across the universe,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.450 align:middle line:84%
the same thing has happened
with the Aquifarian people.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And they do come in
these different forms

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:90%
like I talked about.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So in
your projects then,

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the term Aquifarian would be
an umbrella term that could

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%
refer to many different types?

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:04.486 align:middle line:84%
It's a multi-race under the
phenotype of a water being.

00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you
see any that had

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:84%
a cup in the top of their
head like the Kappa?

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I actually didn't.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I've not seen that at all.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But they somehow are able to
breathe air and also breathe

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:90%
the oxygen in the water.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And some do have
gills like you would

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.980 align:middle line:84%
see in the movies on
their backs and necks.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're multiphasic where
they can walk out of water

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and breathe the air
through their mouth.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've operated
on some of these

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and they have air
bladders and they

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:90%
have different types of lungs.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting to
see four sets of lungs

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:84%
in a being that can
filter just like you would

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
see in the sharks and the
gills of many modern day fish

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.785 align:middle line:90%
that we have here on the planet.

00:16:49.785 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now you had said
that some of these beings

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
actually have a head
that's like a dolphin?

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Just to really be
more specific, if you

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
can see a dolphin with two
arms and two legs and standing

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:90%
upright.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And very, very cylindrical body
which stands out, not that big

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:90%
fin on the back, though.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And they do have these
little webbed-type feet.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But they have arms, and the arms
have two different phalanges.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:90%
You know, two fingers on there.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And the face does
not have a snout

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
like a bottle-nosed dolphin
or anything like that.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But they have a
very large mouth.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And it does come out just
a little bit of a snout

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
but not like you would see
on our modern day dolphins

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:90%
and porpoises.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:44.052 align:middle line:84%
But the mouth goes all the
way to the sides of the face.

00:17:44.052 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That would be a little
disturbing to see, perhaps.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's a
little, but they don't ever

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:90%
open that mouth.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:90%
You never see that mouth.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And they have lips
like a grouper fish.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of
funny looking, actually.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:90%
No offense, guys.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But they do look kind of
comical looking like you'd

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:90%
see on a cartoon character.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And they only communicate
through telepathic waves

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:90%
and through frequency.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear those
sounds, the same sound

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
you hear with the
whales that you probably

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.025 align:middle line:90%
hear in your meditation CDs.

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now with
the dolphin, the eyes

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
are kind of way on the
sides of the heads.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So how do the eyes
place on these faces?

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So imagine
a very round,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:90%
bulbous head like a light bulb.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And those eyes are on
the side of the head,

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:90%
but they do have great vision.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It's still more forward than you
see in our society of dolphins

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
or whales where they are
completely like a hammerhead,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:90%
way out here.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So they are
forward-looking eyes.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Do they have any ears?

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Just the
slits, the holes.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But no ear lobes or
anything like that.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They have very small
fins on their back,

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
not like the big fins you would
see on a dolphin or a shark

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe only three to four
inches of these little

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:90%
fins that go down their back.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.071 align:middle line:84%
Maybe five or six of them in
the middle of the back only.

00:19:07.071 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now you mentioned
that their whole body

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.496 align:middle line:90%
is like a big cylinder.

00:19:10.496 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Do they have just stubby
little legs at the bottom?

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They do, they
have very stubby legs

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:90%
with these big fat feet.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And they do have toes on
their feet and they're webbed.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And they have this
webbing on the sides

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
of their body like the
other Aquifarians, which

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I think is an Aquifarian
trait to have this very thin,

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.596 align:middle line:84%
all the way down their
arms and their body.

00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
actually see it

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
on the heads of different
ones like the manatee ones.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is
something there like

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that cuttlefish fin that goes
all the way down to their feet.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now as
far as the arms go,

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:84%
obviously a typical
dolphin just has flippers,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
but yet when we actually
look at the skeleton

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
inside the flipper, it
actually looks like a hand.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And they do have a humerus.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:90%
They have the same bones we do.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And instead of you guys seeing
like a skeleton of a whale

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
where you guys see
just that bare hand.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:90%
You could see this.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Even the whales, if you look at
their stuff, even their back,

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
they have little leg
bones inside their body

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that somehow over millions of
years have receded into them.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.002 align:middle line:84%
But these are full skeletal
arms and legs just like we have.

00:20:28.002 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if the legs are
stubby, what are the arms like?

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Do they have more
length on their arms?

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.073 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, they have
more length than the legs.

00:20:34.073 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not the fastest
runners in the planet.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But again, it kind of
sounds to me as if there's this

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:84%
humanizing intelligence that
takes different types of life

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and will make it so that it
has opposable thumbs and hands

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.854 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe there
is a conscious energy

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that,
over time, affects

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
other planets around
the whole universe,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and maybe multiverse, where
it's the same five star program.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it's some
sort of program.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So do you have
any information about where

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:90%
these dolphin beings came from?

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.052 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever work with
them directly, one on one?

00:21:19.052 --> 00:21:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've only
indirectly worked with them.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.301 align:middle line:90%
That means I've only seen them.

00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been able
to communicate with them

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
special language

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have
a special device that

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:84%
interprets the frequencies of
their chirps, their chirping.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like Morse
code but very, very fast.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
You could have a few
dozen chirps in a second.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the brain
or the hearing capabilities

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:90%
to catch it.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's so fast.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's you know a
whole conversation

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that we would take maybe,
in one of these episodes,

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes could be done
in five minutes for them.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So do they feel like
it's really slow to talk to us?

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it boring for them?

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, and they
have all a three-times size

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:90%
of our brain.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're very conscious.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I feel bad for the
dolphins and whales

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
here because we should treat
them like we treat these ETs.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Just because we
can't communicate

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
with them doesn't mean
they're not conscious

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:90%
or they're stupid.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.192 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we are ignorant.

00:22:31.192 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you
have no information

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:33.816 align:middle line:90%
about where they originated?

00:22:33.816 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: From Pleiades
and Sirius section.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The Aquifarians
started in the Pleiades

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and then migrated, I
know, to Sirius section.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where in there.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But I'm only telling
you what I've

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.870 align:middle line:84%
read from the history of
being in that library.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated, of course,
with dolphins and whales.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I have a really good
connection with them.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of
underwater photography

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.939 align:middle line:84%
and have a great bond with
these fish and the mammals.

00:23:00.939 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could we now get
into the manatee being,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned,
a little more?

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more exactly what
it looks like visually.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.907 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the face.

00:23:09.907 --> 00:23:11.615 align:middle line:84%
We know what a manatee's
face looks like.

00:23:11.615 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like a walrus
but without the tusks.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, it does
kind of look like that.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I used to make jokes by my dear
departed Beowulf, my dog, that

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:90%
recently passed.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.660 align:middle line:84%
He has this face,
he's a French mastiff.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's a Dogue de
Bordeaux, but it's very human.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It's more stout instead
of having the big,

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
like a manatee has
this big blubber

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:90%
snout with all the whiskers.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It's more contracted, and
the eyes are pitch black

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and they're very close
together on these beings.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're very obese looking.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And they have little hands
that they really don't use,

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a T-Rex.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's really funny.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.507 align:middle line:90%
And they're very comical.

00:23:59.507 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When you
say they look obese,

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.221 align:middle line:84%
would they have the
rolls like we would see

00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:05.470 align:middle line:90%
with a very overweight person?

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, they have rolls.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And they're very strong beings.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
these short stubby legs.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 24 inches up to where
the knees go into the body.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
But they're very
tall, very large.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:84%
They actually dwarfed over
me at least by two feet.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And they had this personality
of a very old scientist.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And they know everything.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Their main thing is
history, about how

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
they came to be the
enlightened Aquifarians.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
They compete with the dolphins
and it's a very funny thing.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like my dog does,
he knows everything.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And I get this real
humble feeling.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:90%
But they can talk.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
They have vocal chords,
they don't chirp.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't have that other
vocal as the dolphins

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and other Aquifarians.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.630 align:middle line:90%
They actually can speak.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And they speak in
very deep tones

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and deep voices unlike any
human you have ever heard.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could replicate
it, but I can't.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So just
some basics here,

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:90%
like what would their color be?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
What would the color
of their skin be?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.513 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's just like
you see the manatees

00:25:26.513 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
They have a dullish gray.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.556 align:middle line:84%
But it's not weather-beaten
like you see our manatees.

00:25:34.556 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked
on many manatees.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I've done stem cells on
manatees down in Florida

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that got run over by
boats with the propellers.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
smoother textured skin

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:90%
that has a sheen to it.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's a bluish gray.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And they do have whiskers on
the sides of their face, kind

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:90%
of like a very small mustache.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said that there's
little hands poking out

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:90%
from the top of their bodies.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.346 align:middle line:84%
Do they have fingers
and thumbs like us?

00:26:02.346 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, they have four
fingers and a very small thumb

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.819 align:middle line:90%
that you can barely see.

00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Just a nub.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.640 align:middle line:90%
And they can use them.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen them
hold anything, though.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen them
grabbing or holding.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%
But they're very agile.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:90%
They can move around.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:90%
They're very fat and large.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.479 align:middle line:90%
And they communicate very well.

00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And you could hear a deep
voice around the corner

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.997 align:middle line:84%
and you know it's one of these
Aquifarians from this system.

00:26:28.997 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And do you
know where they're from?

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're also
from the Pleiades system.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do they
wear any clothing?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They have suits that they
wear that are formed over them

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:90%
through a special device.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.059 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, they can be in
the water or out of the water.

00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:49.850 align:middle line:84%
They can hold their
breath a very long time

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
but they don't breathe the
water like the other ones do,

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:90%
so everyone knows.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But they can definitely work
under water for over an hour.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember a few
of them watching

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:84%
in one of the aquarium's
operating rooms.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:84%
They were treating one of
their own for something.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember exactly what
the story was behind that.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:84%
But I just remember admiring
them working on these beings

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:84%
under water with
their little fingers.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It was really cute.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And I just wasn't
able to ever interact

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
face to face like you and I.
I was just indirectly part

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of a program where
I was watching them

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and people were
teaching me about them.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: OK, last question
then we're out of time here.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
You've mentioned getting a
telepathic, spiritual ecstasy

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
hit from some of these
extraterrestrials.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Now these you said speak
verbally, not telepathically.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Do you still feel some
sort of spiritual bliss

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:84%
by being around
the manatee beings?

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there's
something about them.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:84%
They can resonate an actual
sound from them that humans

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:84%
cannot hear, but
they can feel it.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
beautiful sensation.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of when
I hear a good song.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.089 align:middle line:84%
Starting to like, you
know, starting to feel it.

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I feel
when they're around.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It's this low tone
thump inside you.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
You can feel this from a
very far distance from them.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
They were at least 30,
maybe 40 feet from me.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was outside of the tank.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.617 align:middle line:84%
And they're sitting
there doing this energy.

00:28:29.617 --> 00:28:31.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just energy,
they're not dancing.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But it makes you
feel like music.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like harmonic of some sort.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.504 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:28:38.504 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well that's all the
time we have in this episode.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
fascinating and I

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
do hope we get to meet
these beings soon.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that will happen?

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, I know
it's going to happen.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.387 align:middle line:90%
That would be amazing.

00:28:50.387 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Well I want to thank
you for watching.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
This is "Cosmic Disclosure" with
our special guest Emery Smith.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:90%
