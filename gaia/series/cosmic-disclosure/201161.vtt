>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure",
we are talking about the real

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:10%
secret space program with
Peruvian researcher and author

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:10%
Ricardo Gonzalez, who had
multiple contacts with

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:10%
an extraterrestrial species
called the Apunians.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:90%

>> In your books, you write
about the secret space program

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:90%
that involves Alpha Centuri.

What is the secret
space program,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and how is it connected
to Alpha Centauri?

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that there is a
secret space program that goes

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:90%
beyond the moon and Mars.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Since 2001, in our
experiences of contact,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
we were asked to pay close
attention to this type

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:90%
of secret initiative.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.412 align:middle line:84%
The ETs talked to us about
the Longshot Project.

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we looked into it, we
discovered that this Project

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Longshot actually existed.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It was developed in the
1980s, in the United States.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a ship without
a crew, which would

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:90%
be sent to Alpha Centauri.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Later, the project
was abandoned,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and transformed into a
project by Stephen Hawking.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%

program before Stephen Hawking?

>> From the information
we gathered,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
it spoke about a collaboration
between the US navy and NASA.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the original
documents are now

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:90%
available on the internet.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
When we were investigating
it back in the day,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:84%
we actually had to figure
it out through contacts

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:90%
we had in the US.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%

information is public.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:90%

this program?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> As I said, the program
was abandoned officially.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And the objective was
to send a ship that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
had no crew to Alpha Centauri,
because there was already

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
the suspicion that in
that region of the cosmos,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.280 align:middle line:84%
there were planets that could
potentially sustain human life.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
This is very curious,
because the project

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:90%
was taking place in the '80s.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:10%
Then many years later,
in 2012, scientists

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:10%
began to speak
officially about worlds

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:10%
that were suitable for humans
to go, places in Alpha Centauri.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What type of craft or portal
would they utilize to get from

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Earth to Alpha Centauri?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, this is a very
complex question to describe

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:84%
the technology that would
be able to take us there.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The information that
the ETs gave to us

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is that initially as
humans, we would first

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
try to confirm the existence
of places in Alpha Centauri.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
This is why they planned
to send an unmanned ship,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
first to confirm the
existence of these places,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:84%
then we would trace the
route and travel there

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:90%
in ships with crews.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:84%
The project of Stephen Hawking
is actually an improved version

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:90%
of Project Longshot.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
As we can remember,
what the great scientist

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Hawking proposed
was to actually send ships

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:90%
that would be very, very small.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:10%
It would be nanotechnology
that would actually

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:10%
be launched toward the
cosmos using laser lights.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
He actually presented
this material

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:84%
at a conference in
New York to the press.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:90%
This was April 12, 2016.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
He did this alongside
a Russian investor

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:90%
in energy, Yuri Milner.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And aside from Yuri Milner,
the owner of Facebook

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:90%
was also there.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Very curious that the
world of social media

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
was present at that conference.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps because social media has
become a form of investigation

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:90%
and of recruitment.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:84%
This project is just
attempting to establish

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
the basis for a possible
future trip to Alpha Centauri.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.293 align:middle line:84%
So with what type of technology
could we possibly go there?

00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
To better answer your question,
which is very interesting,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
it's a technology that
we still do not have.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're starting
with ships without a crew.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.965 align:middle line:84%
But the ETs say that the
technology will emerge.

00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It will come from hadron
accelerators and places

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
like CERN in
Europe, for example.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%

have already discovered life

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:90%

And if so, what are
the beings like?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> When I've spoken about
this group of ETs that I call

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
the Apunians, whose name
comes from a myth related

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to the Peruvian mountains,
as I explained, "Apu"

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
means mountain, beings that
were seen in the mountains.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they originate
in Alpha Centauri.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.840 align:middle line:84%
They have a human
aspect, very tall,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and advanced psychic and
technological abilities.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
They say that part
of the population

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
in those worlds in Alpha
Centauri, not all of them

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:90%
have ET origins.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I know this sounds
like science fiction,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
but some of those
beings in Alpha Centauri

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:90%
are human descendants.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
They are the astronauts
that traveled there.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Because of a crisis that
occurred on our planet,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
they had no choice
but to move there.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It was a human immigration
without precedent.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
This means that perhaps some
of the ETs that are currently

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
coming to visit us,
maybe some of them

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:84%
could be the humans
that traveled there,

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:90%
or their descendants.

they've told us,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:84%
there was a group of about 400
human astronauts in a time that

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
has not yet occurred
on our planet,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that traveled there with
this new technology.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
All of them made it,
but their descendants

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
have actually been mistaken
for ETs in current contacts.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they made
a trip across time,

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and they actually came to
Earth to warn us about what

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:90%
could happen in the future.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know that Stephen Hawking
knew this when he referenced it

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
when he took that picture with
the sign saying "welcome time

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps he was waiting for them.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
If our scientists
know that there

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
are worlds that can be
colonized in Alpha Centauri,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
it's because somebody told
them, not because they

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:90%
discovered it themselves.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps these very beings told
our scientists this story,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:90%
almost like a hidden letter.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the last move on the
table, in case it goes wrong.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the message.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The message is
that we don't have

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to play that last
card on the table

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> They are trying to help
us, but in another way.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
The ones that could assist
us, I'm talking about the ETs

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that respect humanity and
are part of the alliance.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
You might remember that there
was some information that

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
was in ufology in the 1980s,
where many contactees said

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
that they had some
type of vision,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:84%
where they could see humans
going on board spaceships,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:90%
and would leave Earth.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:84%
This produced some type of
fever of visions in many people

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
at the time, that they
interpreted as an ET

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.767 align:middle line:84%
evacuation, just like
the gods of the Hopi

00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:90%
with their ancestors.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
There were groups of
contactees in the '80s that

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
said that this project
of world evacuation

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen any
minute, and only those people

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
with the highest frequency
would be evacuated.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Even though some of this
can seem silly to some of us

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
at this point, at the
time a lot of people

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:90%
believed it completely.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
beyond the hallucinations

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and overstatements, was there
a real vision behind all that?

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it wasn't an
evacuation of humans by ETs,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
but more of an evacuation of
humans from the future, so

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:84%
that many humans were actually
evacuating themselves,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the secret project
to Alpha Centauri.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So the travelers from Alpha
Centauri who are here now were

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
possibly, hypothetically
speaking of the story,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:84%
evacuated by their families
and from another system?

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The descendants of the
travelers that went to Alpha

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Centauri somehow were able
to arrive here in our time,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
in order to warn their
grandparents or their great

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
grandparents what could
happen in the future.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds like a science
fiction story from Hollywood,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
but reality is
better than fiction.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
When Stephen Hawking and
his team of scientists

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:84%
from Cambridge
suggested that we only

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
have 100 years to migrate
to another planet,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
we did not see
this in the movies.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
When Stephen Hawking gave this
conference in the US in 2016,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and spoke about the necessity
to explore Alpha Centauri,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
we saw it in the news,
not in the movies.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So it is important to pay
attention to the science.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
This secret space
program to Alpha Centauri

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:90%
is already underway.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, some of
the ETs that are today

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
having contact with
people on Earth

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
could be the descendants
of those astronauts.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Who do you believe is
in charge of this program?

00:10:48.655 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Today?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
Ivika and Antarel,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
the ETs that are
in contact with me,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
there isn't a particular leader
that is in charge of this

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Not even a nation
that is in charge.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It is a secret program that is
an international collective.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, in
2020, it is actually

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
taking its first steps
behind the scenes.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you trust this collective?

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They're in the beginning
stages of making the pathway

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:90%
for the program.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
It will be called the Ark.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It will not be established
in any great world power.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The special launchpad
is not going

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to be in the United
States, or Europe.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It won't be in China.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
It will be in the
south of South America.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
To be more exact, it will
be in the desert of Atacama,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
in Chile.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:84%
There are some
installations of some

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of the most scientific
powers there already.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did they pick
the Atacama Desert?

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Because Atacama is an ideal
place for an interdimensional

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:90%
trip.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:10%
As we were talking
about physical ships

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:10%
in order to take a trip to
Alpha Centauri with a technology

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:10%
that humans will
soon discover, it

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:10%
will be required
that the ships launch

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:10%
from a special place that will
allow for the first impulse

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:10%
to be controlled.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:10%
It's hard for me to
describe it with my words.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Think about it as
a quantic impulse

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that has to be done from a
place that is a node of power.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
That place exists in
the Atacama Desert.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Currently, it's populated
by one of the most important

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
observatories in the
world, the Project Alma.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
That has at this
time 66 antennas

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
that are investigating
Alpha Centauri.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You know how the ancient
people of the Atacama Desert

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:90%
call that valley of Atacama?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Chajnantor.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
That means "the
place of the launch."

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Memories from the future.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like a great plateau
in the desert of Atacama.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:90%
That's 5,000 meters high.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
It's actually higher
than the peak of Mt.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating place.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
When the Alma Observatory
stops functioning,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
according to the ETs, they will
build the official launch pad

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:90%
for Alpha Centauri.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Who is allowed to go on
this official launch off?

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have the details
about this information.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Just very small
pieces of information

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that they have given us.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.135 align:middle line:84%
A collaboration
of various powers.

00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:36.370 align:middle line:90%
It will be called the Ark.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>> According to these
beings, Ricardo,

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:84%
what events might push humanity
off planet, to leave Earth?

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.748 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.748 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There are different things
that could force humanity

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to abandon the planet.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:84%
These events could
basically be grouped first

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
in human behavior, like poor
behavior, bad coexistence.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It could be worsened
by a cosmic tragedy.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Always according to
what they tell us,

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
we could experience the
impact of an asteroid

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
on the northern
part of the Earth.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
If this happens, it
will not completely

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:84%
eliminate the
population of Earth,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
but it will worsen
our world situation,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
because it would be
a very big tragedy,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and it will push a
huge migration that

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
will highlight our poverty
and our need for survival.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they ever mention a
timeline to you or anyone

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.292 align:middle line:84%
in your group, when
this could happen?

00:14:37.292 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They say that this has
already happened in another

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:90%
timeline.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So if not for that, these
ETs that are not really ETs

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:90%
would not exist.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Because these quote unquote
ETs that we are having contact

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
with, some of them
would be the descendants

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:90%
of those astronauts.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, this
occurrence has already

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:90%
happened in another timeline.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, in what year in that
other timeline did this occur?

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:90%
In the year 2027.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
That means that in
this timeline, that

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:90%
could happen in the same year.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily, but
if it does happen,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:90%
we know what's happening next.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What will it take for
it not to happen, Ricardo?

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In order to change things,
to make sure that this does not

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
happen, so that these patterns
of behavior and occurrence do

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
not happen in this timeline,
we must change our conduct,

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and get more people to
change their consciousness.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Many people will say
this is impossible.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Look at the way things
are in the world.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's not necessary that
the whole population changes.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:84%
According to these ETs,
as long as a group,

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
a critical mass of people reach
this level of consciousness,

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:84%
not even 10% of the
world's population,

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:84%
it could start a domino effect,
a chain reaction of awareness

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
that could actually influence
the different timelines.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the key to be
able to change things.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
This is why you will notice
that in the recent history

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, there is an
acceleration of the sharing

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
of these topics, intense,
rushed, it's reaching millions

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
of people, because the more
people remember these memories,

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
we will have the tools to
be able to modify this.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Here we open two
different interpretations.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:84%
One might say,
how is it possible

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that a small group
of humanity could

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
have more weight than the
majority of the population that

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:90%
is asleep?

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like this TV
studio, which is pretty large,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden had a blackout,
and there were no lights here.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
You would not be
able to see anything.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Everything would be dark.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what would
permeate this big room.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
However, all you would need is
just one person with a light,

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:90%
and it would stop the darkness.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Just one candle.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Then another way the
other interpretation

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
share is not just

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness can generate
miracles in the future.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:84%
It activates rules that are
unknown to the human being

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
right now, that actually
work in other worlds

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations, protocols
that would be able to help us.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if we
were able to achieve

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
a certain level of
consciousness in humanity,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
we would be able to get
help from other beings

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do it,
they're not going to help.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like if a person was
lost in the Alaskan mountains.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The helicopter,
with help, is not

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:84%
going to suddenly
arrive to the camp

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
where the person was lost,
unless this person did

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:84%
something to get the
attention of the helicopter,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
or had written SOS in the snow.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Things don't come for free.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:90%
We have to work and earn them.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
The level of consciousness
of a group in humanity

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
can activate those protocols
from another civilization,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
so that with their
knowledge and technology,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
they can come and
help, and not just make

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:90%
an asteroid take a detour.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this part also, you said
not just the Apunians but this

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
federation, you said there was
others involved that may or may

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.205 align:middle line:84%
not allow this meteor, just
hypothetically speaking, come.

00:18:22.205 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Are the Apunians,
number one, are

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:84%
they part of this
federation, and in what way?

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> There are several ET
Civilizations that are involved

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
in that alliance, that some
involved with the contact

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
phenomena, as you call
it, the Federation,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and the beings that we call
Apunians are involved in that

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:84%
alliance that is respectful
and loving to humanity.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
There are organizations that
are amazing in the cosmos,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
of mutual help, of
progress and evolution.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps a skeptic
could think that we

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:10%
are inspired by "Star Trek" when
we speak of these things today.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
this knowledge came

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
before all the stories
of science fiction

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:90%
that we've heard of.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
would be surprised

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of things that we
have seen in science fiction

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
always existed, just
like many of the things

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen in
science fiction,

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.800 align:middle line:84%
like "Star Trek"
are today a reality.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:24.770 align:middle line:84%
The USB drives, plasma TVs,
iPads, tablets, the holograms,

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Before we saw them in actuality,
we saw them in "Star Trek."

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:90%
We were remembering.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.255 align:middle line:84%
>> I use the term
"federation" now and then.

00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there another
term that you're

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
aware of that they might
use besides the federation?

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I mentioned earlier that
I don't have details about

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
the different worlds that
are part of this alliance,

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:90%
how many worlds compose it.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that
many civilizations

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
from stellar sectors over the
universe that we are aware of

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:90%
are part of this alliance.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But we do have to
make a distinction

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:90%
between those stellar regions.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, when somebody
speaks about the Pleiades

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
or of Orion, they
forget that we are not

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:90%
speaking about one world.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.607 align:middle line:84%
>> We're speaking
about a constellation.

00:20:12.607 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>> So many.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a group, of a group of
stars that have multiple solar

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:84%
As an example, there
are people that, when

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:84%
they look to the stars,
they see the belt of Orion,

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and they could think it's
just three stars that

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:90%
are lined up like that.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.263 align:middle line:90%
>> I laugh at this.

00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It probably happens to
you at the conferences,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
when someone comes up and
says, "I am from Pleiades.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I am from Orion."

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that's a
trillion different planets

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:90%
and stars there.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> You got it.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:90%
I feel the same.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think they
understand the concept of--

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not just you opening a flat
book and look at the astrology

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%
This is a much greater thing.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so glad you brought
that up, because for me it

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:90%
is very entertaining.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But I feel for
everyone, because they

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
do have this affinity for this,
because it's in their lineage.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Every stellar
sector has a frequency.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But within that
very system, there

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:84%
are sub levels of frequency,
civilizations, agendas,

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
The universe is so diverse.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:84%
It is possible that ET
entities, as a wide margin

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
of identification,
would tell a witness,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:84%
"I come from this sector
of the Pleiadean stars."

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But if the contact
becomes more profound,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
the entity might be able to
tell the witness exactly where

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:90%
they're from.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So having said this, when we
speak about the worlds that

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
make up the
confederation, there are

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
civilizations from the Pleiades
and Orion that are involved,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and others that have
not been allowed to be.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the
civilizations from Orion,

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
for example, according to the
messages that we've received,

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
have had behavior that is
balanced and in equilibrium

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And some have not, the
same as the Pleiades,

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.250 align:middle line:84%
or any other place
in the cosmos.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so difficult
to say which worlds are part

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:90%
of it, what the agendas are.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like, look
at planet Earth.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I am from Earth, but look
how many races on Earth.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
The same thing amongst
the solar system.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
In the projects, we
don't say, "oh, we

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
have a Pleiadean piece
of tissue or ET."

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
We say, this is the frequency,
with a number on it,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that they are from this
system, this star system.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
sequences to that.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Like you said, subdivisions.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Many, many, many.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to clarify for
the viewers what you said.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
can attest to that.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no names for that.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.025 align:middle line:84%
It's measured by the
frequency from that sector.

00:22:46.025 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:90%
You said the word "sector."

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is
measured in coordinates

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of sectors out there, of
planetary planets and moons

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.650 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with that.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:10%
It's like if an ET
in the Pleiades,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:10%
let's say to be more exact,
in a system of the star

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:10%
Taygeta welcomes
a human Astronaut

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:10%
and when the human
astronaut arrives,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:10%
the ET says, "where
are you from?

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:90%
What a long trip.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds and hundreds
of light years."

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.415 align:middle line:84%
The astronaut is not going
to say "I'm from Kansas."

00:23:23.415 --> 00:23:25.540 align:middle line:84%
He might not even say "I'm
from the United States",

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.340 align:middle line:90%
or even "I'm from Earth."

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:84%
He might not even be able to
say "I'm from the solar system."

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
If the human astronaut was
more knowledgeable about the ET

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:84%
civilization, and
they are aware that we

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
are in a solar
system on Earth, that

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
could perhaps be seen as part
of a larger constellation, that

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.993 align:middle line:84%
perhaps looks like
some type of an animal

00:23:49.993 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:90%
that they would call Bubble.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
The astronaut from
Kansas would say,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:84%
"I'm from the
constellation of Bubble",

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:90%
so that the ET could understand.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, these
details can be disclosed

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:90%
when there is more contact.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:84%
We're such a microcosm,
planet Earth,

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:84%
compared to the entire
universe out there.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's fun and entertaining
to talk about how large it

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.840 align:middle line:90%
is with everyone out there.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's just fascinating,
fascinating stuff.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Ricardo, is there
any parting message

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.095 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to
leave for our viewers?

00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be the main part
of the message that I would

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.945 align:middle line:84%
like to share, that I have
received from these beings?

00:24:36.945 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
What would I dare to share
with these people that

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
are watching me now?

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It's really difficult.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of ideas, and
a lot of emotions right now.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.507 align:middle line:84%
But to leave my
intellect aside, and just

00:24:51.507 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
by feeling in this moment,
there's some things

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:90%
that I feel I want to say.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
That it is important to
know that we are not alone

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Saying that, it's
even insufficient.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
In reality, we're
not alone on Earth.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.965 align:middle line:84%
To become aware of
this will liberate us.

00:25:09.965 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
The other thought
that I have right now

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:84%
about the possible future, we
are able to change that future.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
We are able to change the
things that might come.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The main message
that I have gotten

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the more an
individual awakens and gains

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.840 align:middle line:84%
awareness and
consciousness, that person

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:84%
will have more tools
to decide, and to be

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:90%
able to change things.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It is really absurd
to try to change

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
the world, or your
country, or your society.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Try yourself first.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Be at peace with your family.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, how can you be at
peace with the cosmic family?

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
psychological message.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to be a coach.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:90%
This is just common sense.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
We cannot hug the universe if
we don't hug each other This

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:09.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that we have to
agree with any injustices,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:90%
that we ignore the lies.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:84%
We can still have the
character to stand up

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to what we feel is
wrong, because the truth

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:90%
is part of this coexistence.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the genuine
and authentic intention

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:90%
of changing.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Bravo.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Ricardo, for saying that.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Very touching.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Once again, Ricardo, thank
you for coming on the show.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for this
interview, Emery.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure".

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
