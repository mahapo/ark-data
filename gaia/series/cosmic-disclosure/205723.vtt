00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.180 align:middle line:10%
we are with retired SEAL Team
Six Chief Petty Officer Michael

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
Jaco who has over 35 years of
extensive combat experience,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:10%
including 11 years as
a CIA security officer.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Michael, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL JACO: Glad
to be here, Emery.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.485 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, before we jump
into "Cosmic Disclosure," let's

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
talk about why you're here
and a little bit about the CIA

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:90%
and SEAL Team Six.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:90%
And why did you come out?

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: So being in the
SEAL Teams for 24 years

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.737 align:middle line:84%
and then in the CIA
for 11, I learned

00:00:56.737 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:90%
a lot of different things.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Learned a lot of things that I
felt that could help humanity.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
I was opened up to some of
this secret space program

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle line:84%
information that's
happened over time.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
All the things that I learned
in the SEAL Teams and in the CIA

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
took me to a great level
as far as remote viewing,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
remote influencing,
tapping into my intuition.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:84%
All these different
things have led me

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to tapping into my now memories
of the secret space program.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What does a
SEAL Team Six chief petty

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Officer actually do?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Well, I started out
as a senior enlisted E-6.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
As an E-6, I was in
charge of operations.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I was in charge of diving,
weapons, demolitions,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:90%
stuff like that.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.342 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I rose to
chief petty officer.

00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
As a chief petty
officer, I was in charge

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
of what we called at
the time boat crew.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So in the squadrons
as they're called now,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
there's several different boat
crews, four different boat

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:90%
crews usually.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was in charge of one of
those as a chief petty officer.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in combat in
Panama during this time frame.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
thing that as a SEAL

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd always wanted to experience,
and having that experience

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
took me to a different
level as well, being

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
able to control myself in a
very high-threat situation,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:90%
still operate.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I was very calm.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
All of the training that
I'd had throughout the years

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:90%
prepared me for that.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.385 align:middle line:84%
I felt that the training itself
was more intense than combat.

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Combat, as I would experience
at SEAL Team Six and then

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
eventually when I
got into the CIA,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
was a lot easier because I'd
had all this intense training

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.025 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could
you please tell me

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:44.320 align:middle line:84%
about your intuitive
experiences in project?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: So my intuitive
experiences in the SEAL Teams,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I started to understand and see
things before they happened.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I became a remote viewer
while in the SEAL Teams.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.690 align:middle line:84%
That was training
that I did on my own.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think everyone
has those experiences

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
over time, that gut feeling
that a lot of people have.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the intuition
coming in and informing us.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:90%
A lot of guys understood that.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:90%
I took it to another level.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.008 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
really made it kick

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
was when I started the
Hand-in-Hand program

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.790 align:middle line:90%
in the SEAL Teams.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, could you
tell me about that?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Absolutely.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I gave demonstrations to
the secretary of defense,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:90%
admirals all over the world.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty impressive.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
point, I started out

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
in other avenues, other career
areas throughout my career.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But that was one of the
highlights of my career,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.387 align:middle line:84%
starting the
Hand-in-Hand program.

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And that opened me up to
these intuitive experiences,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
because I would actually have
an out-of-body experience

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.028 align:middle line:90%
while I fought.

00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you've
spoken publicly

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.902 align:middle line:84%
about the secret space program
and your involvement with that.

00:03:46.902 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Could you share that with us?

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: The public
disclosure that I've

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
been having has been a little
piecemeal over the years.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I had someone come to me
approximately five years ago

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and said, do you know you're
part of the secret space

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
program, that you're
a super soldier?

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.268 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, a super soldier?

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:90%
That kind of resonates with me.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But at the time I was
like, eh, I don't know.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.703 align:middle line:90%
So two or three other people--

00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book, "The
Intuitive Warrior."

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:10%
And when I wrote that book,
it attracted a lot of people

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.154 align:middle line:10%
from that genre.

00:04:16.154 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:10%
So more and more people started
to come up to me and say,

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:10%
hey, you're part of the
secret space program.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:90%
You're a super soldier.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then it finally started
to resonate with me.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I started doing the insight
review on my own end,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:90%
looking into it.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw other
people talk about it.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:90%
There is something out there.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:90%
There's something to this.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to
listen to some people

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
here on "Cosmic
Disclosure" occasionally,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I would start to finish
people's sentences.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I know
what he's going to say.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.755 align:middle line:90%
And then I was like, oh my gosh.

00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm involved in this
program, you know?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.805 align:middle line:84%
I started to awaken
more and more.

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It came from just bits
and pieces of information

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to larger pieces.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And now after I've had this
regression here in Gaia,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
it has really blown up, and I've
gotten a lot of information.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, you had this
regression, which is amazing,

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
by the most famous
psychotherapist

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and hypnotherapist, Barbara
Lamb, who has regressed

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:90%
close to 3,000 people.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that clip.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: I remember being
in a room with my mother.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm three or four years old.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
men in the room,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're asking me if I want
to be part of a space camp.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:90%
My mother's excited for me.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.268 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:05:37.268 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They tell me about the
adventures that I'll have,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%
the training that I'll have.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
It'll be unlike anything that
I'll experience anywhere else.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So then I remember
being in a van,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
traveling with other children
and going to a military base.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I live in Columbia, South
Carolina at the time.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember traveling
to Fort Jackson

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:90%
and going into an underground--

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:90%
seems like a building.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
We drive the van
in and all of us

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:90%
unload and we start training.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And the training is
absolutely amazing.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I remember levitating
things eventually.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I remember levitating myself.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember learning
how to overcome fears

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to take
one part of the brain,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian part of the
brain, and turn it off

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
was the things we were being--
we were taught as children.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
The group that I'm with gets
smaller and smaller over time,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.413 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, I
stopped going on these trips,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
but I have another memory
where I'm actually there.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So as a little boy, it's
almost like a separation

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
where I'm in my
reality with my mother,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and then I no longer
go to the space camp.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I have memories
of actually being there.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I was older.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I was more like five
or six at this point.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they created
a separate body for me,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and then I started continuing
on with the separate body.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Although I had
still consciousness

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that I came from my mother and
I had a reality at that point,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
but now my consciousness
is completely involved

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
in this new training,
this new experience.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
It was mainly
mastering our bodies,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:84%
mastering our
consciousness that we

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:84%
were involved in in
the very early stages,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and focus our minds
in ways that we could

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.775 align:middle line:90%
do just incredible things.

00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That was
amazing, Michael.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about
the space camp.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: The space
camp basically,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:84%
when I went into that, it was
at around three years old.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Three to four years
old, my memories are.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.195 align:middle line:84%
And then I have memories
in this life of not

00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:90%
being part of that program.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like they didn't
pick me up anymore.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But then now that I'm
having these regressions,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm having memories of I
continued in that program.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
disconnect happened.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they cloned me
or what happened, but you know,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I have a memory of
continuing in my current life

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and then actually
continuing in that life.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So there was a process
that started more training.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
In this training, I was learning
how to telepathy communicate

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I would
have a partner.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:90%
It was a little girl.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
And the two of us
would have telepathy.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.966 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were lots of
girls in this program.

00:08:34.966 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that
it's all a guy program thing,

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually women
in these programs too.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
is because women

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:90%
are more intuitive than men.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're learning how to develop
our intuitive right brain

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
hemisphere of our right
brain, and then communicate

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:90%
with our left analytical brain.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So that was part of the process
starting as a three-year-old.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine three-year-olds
learning that now?

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of dumbing
down that I think happens

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:90%
in our current environment.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:84%
But in that environment,
you are on a fast track.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
that I learned more

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
in that program in
the five to six years

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
that I was in it until
I started to travel

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:84%
to other bases,
on-the-ground bases,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:84%
than I probably learned all
the way up through high school,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even some of the
college courses I've done.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.947 align:middle line:90%
They were extremely advanced.

00:09:23.947 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
They were able to do
that because of the way

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
they present information,
their understanding of the way

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:90%
the brain works.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And they just really
sock it to us, you know?

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It was full day, all day long.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't playtime
for little kids.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:90%
That was our play.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.017 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It was progressive
advancement training.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Absolutely.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Very, very-- yeah.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Very aggressive,
though, you know?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And as I look back on
it, it's unbelievable

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
the speed with which
they were able to get us

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:90%
into these abilities.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, telepathy was one
of the things we learned.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
We also learned how to levitate
objects with our minds.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:90%
And that progressed.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
It progressed to
the point where we--

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
something very light like
a feather to something

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
heavy like a block,
a wooden block.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we would
levitate multiple blocks

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.928 align:middle line:90%
with our abilities.

00:10:14.928 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
explain to the listeners

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that the density compared to
a feather to an army tank,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.552 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:10:23.552 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Eventually,
you learn that.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
So it really is.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Levitating yourself, getting
to the point where you can

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:90%
actually pass through objects.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
At first, it was just like
you put your hand in water.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:90%
It felt like that.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.498 align:middle line:84%
So you would pass your
hand through a wooden wall.

00:10:43.498 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I never progressed
to the point where

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I could do it
through metal, but I

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
remember doing it through wood.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
walked through that.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So the deep
articulation, learning

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
how to vibrate at certain levels
and moving through objects

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:90%
is what we learned.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We eventually learned
how to work together.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:90%
I could bend metal.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
My partner and I working
together could heat that metal

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:90%
and cause it to split.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's lots of different
things we learned,

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and these were the
building blocks

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
that we used to move
forward to start

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to use
weaponry and fly aircraft,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
have that telepathic
communication with aircraft,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
looking glass technology, and on
and on and on as we progressed.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, why would you
need levitation or the ability

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.775 align:middle line:90%
to walk through walls?

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Those
different abilities

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that we learned over
time would translate

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
into further abilities
as we moved forward.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Now walking through objects,
just like we see in the movies

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
where people walk
through objects,

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is very important to
understand the technology,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
understand the actual process
that you go through mentally

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
different vibrations.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So vibratory fields, once you
understand a vibratory field,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:84%
you start to apply
it in everything.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Just like when I
learned hand-to-hand,

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:84%
when I learned
knife fighting, when

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I learned to shoot
my pistol, when

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to
shoot my long gun,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
if I lost any one of those,
if I lost my long gun,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I could go to my pistol.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
If I lost my pistol,
I could go to a knife.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:84%
If I lost a knife,
I'm a hand-to-hand guy

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
until I get one of those
weapons back from my enemy.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same thing with
these levitation abilities.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to go
deeper and deeper into how

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to use your mind, you
are multifaceted in

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
all these different
combat forms.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When did those
memories first arise

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:90%
that you remember from?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: The first ones
were working with weaponry,

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:90%
flying aircraft.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't
understand that because I was

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:90%
flying aircraft with my mind.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was interacting
with the aircraft.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And it took me
months and months,

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:84%
maybe even a year to understand
that some aircraft actually

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:90%
have a soul.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, how can
a soul go in an aircraft?

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And some souls
make that decision.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:90%
They choose to be part of it.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Just like a soul
comes into our body,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
just like a soul incarnates
in an animal, a plant,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
so forth, a soul can
incarnate into an actual piece

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.163 align:middle line:90%
of machinery, an aircraft.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We call it
consciousness-assisted

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.005 align:middle line:84%
technology where you
link up to the vehicle.

00:13:23.005 --> 00:13:23.805 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Absolutely.

00:13:23.805 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So I had memories of that
coming through and even more.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Weapons systems that
were on the aircraft.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:90%
It took a while.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I started to learn
how there's a process,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and then I started to
have memories as a child,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
being trained as a
child to do these things

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and focus my consciousness
so that I could connect

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
with weaponry, with aircraft,
and with animals and stuff

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
like that that
we'd use in combat.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.890 align:middle line:84%
What all of the sudden
triggered these memories?

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: So it goes
back quite a ways,

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:90%
all the way to my childhood.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of these men
coming in and talking to my mom

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and asking me if I wanted to
be part of a space camp-type

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
organization.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going
off on a couple trips,

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and then it seemed
like I just stopped.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And just recently when we
had the regression here,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I have more memories that
came through for that.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But it also goes
into my teenage years

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.175 align:middle line:84%
where I remember playing
putt-putt golf with all

00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
my buddies, and there was
this being that came through.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
a portal opened.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:90%
A being came through.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%
It was like in a cosmic suit.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was me from the future.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And I communicated
with me telepathically

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that everything's
going to be OK.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.605 align:middle line:90%
You're part of this program.

00:14:43.605 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
What are you talking
about, you know?

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.137 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around to
see if my friends could

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:90%
see what was going on.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:90%
And my future self disappeared.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So I've been having these little
experiences throughout my life,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
little periods where I
would see people that I work

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:90%
with like at SEAL Team Six.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to just
disappear for a while.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd come
back, and everything

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:90%
was just like it was before.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of
compartmentalized work

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that happens, you
don't ask questions.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So I would see things like
that, and occasionally I

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
would come back and guys would
say, where have you been?

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what do you
mean, where have I been?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:90%
I've been here the whole time.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're like-- and
then they'd shut up.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And then because of that
compartmentalized stuff,

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.143 align:middle line:84%
they just assumed that
I'd been off on something.

00:15:28.143 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what are
they talking about?

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But I had periods
like that where

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I had memories that were--

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I would disappear sometimes,
I guess, and come back.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So it happened over
a period of time.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you think
they actually sought you out

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:90%
for this?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: I think they
actually seek people out--

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
they have a technique
for seeing that there

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:84%
are some of us that have
these abilities from birth.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like when you
think about the three wise men.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:90%
They sought out Jesus.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Or Buddha.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Every time Buddha reincarnates,
they seek him out.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:90%
They know him as a little boy.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I think they know that
some of us that come in

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.780 align:middle line:90%
have these abilities.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And they seek us
out, and they either

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
ask us if we want to go
in these programs, which

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:90%
is my experience.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of anyone
that's been forced

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:84%
into these experiences, but
I've heard of people being

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:90%
forced into these experiences.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So some of us are sought out
because we have the abilities

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:90%
they recognize somehow.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What else comes
to mind that's become

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
really conscious for you?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Some of the
ones like working

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%
with aircraft, weapons systems.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I have memories
of wearing suits,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
different types of suits.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, where we go out
and just reconnaissance,

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and these suits
make us invisible.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds of
technology in these suits.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.895 align:middle line:84%
If we get wounded, they treat
us and help heal us and stuff,

00:16:49.895 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
or at least keep
us going, you know?

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Whereas normally, someone
would be incapacitated.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
With these suits, there's
blood clotting agents

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that's applied, like
maybe a morphine

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:90%
for that particular area.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we continue to operate
even if we're wounded.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So these different
suits, you know,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.986 align:middle line:84%
I see going into an
armory and having

00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
all of these different
suits, depending on--

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:84%
just like I would in SEAL
Team Six or other SEAL Teams

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
where I we go into
the armory, pick out

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
the arms that I needed
for a particular mission

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to go on.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going
into these armories

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and seeing four
different types of suits.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were progressive,
like the one where you're just

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
doing a recon, which is
very slim, to one that's

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.420 align:middle line:84%
got light comp armor on it,
and then one with heavy armor,

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and then one with heavy armor
with weaponry all over it.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:46.928 align:middle line:84%
So different levels of suits,
armor, and also weapons.

00:17:46.928 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael,
here's another clip

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
about you talking about bases on
the moon and extraterrestrials.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: We left the
planet in starships.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:90%
There was large groups of us.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
There was up to 50
or 60 of us that

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
would get into almost
like a glider plane,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:90%
it seemed like to me.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:90%
And then it would take off.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It would almost be
ejected from the Earth,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
almost like a slingshot
type of device

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:90%
would sling us into space.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:28.955 align:middle line:84%
And then we would float almost
with no gravity to the moon.

00:18:28.955 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And then once we were
at the moon, then

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
we would go into the
internal bases in the moon

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:90%
and do more training.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
humanoid races out there.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
different star beams.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.940 align:middle line:84%
They would all have their
own little individual areas

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, on the
surface of the moon,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and underneath in
the subsurface.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So all around the
moon are bases,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:84%
even though many people
think that the bases are just

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.205 align:middle line:90%
on the dark side of the moon.

00:19:01.205 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of the
moon that we can see,

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.105 align:middle line:84%
there also are bases,
but they're cloaked.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.678 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.678 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael,
is this space force

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that you have been
part of for many years

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
the same as the one
that's in the media today?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: No.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm seeing is this
is the disclosure part.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not part of our mission.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It would be like a
little baby being

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.052 align:middle line:84%
integrated with an advanced
intelligence being.

00:19:34.052 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not going to happen.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So that little baby
that's the space force

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing right
now will be the disclosure.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, maybe some of that project
will be integrated in some way.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's extremely basic,
extremely low-level.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's part of what
disclosure's all about.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So in the CIA
and working in the SEALs,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
you had gone through very
traumatic experiences,

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And how do you separate
that from the space program?

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: So this took
me a while to make

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
this distinguishing
factor, that I am actually

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:84%
living a separate reality
in the secret space program

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.757 align:middle line:84%
concurrently while I'm
having this reality.

00:20:14.757 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of people
get confused with this,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:90%
and I did for a long time.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Are they taking me and
putting me in this program

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:90%
and then bringing me back?

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a completely different
reality that's going on there.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.258 align:middle line:84%
When I feel these
different things,

00:20:28.258 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I have this reality that I
know that I'm experiencing,

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and I have these memories
that seem to be coming through

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:90%
of a separate reality.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
This separate reality
is completely different.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I can distinguish the two.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you know,
I've had my kneecap

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
shattered in this
reality as a Navy SEAL

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:90%
in a combat training mission.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:90%
And that was a lot of pain.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've also had
an experience where

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I've had the left side
of my head blown off

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:90%
in a secret space program.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And in that space
program, basically they

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:90%
can put you back together.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
You can literally leave your
body, soul can leave your body.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
They can put you in a tank,
hook you up, regenerate anything

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:90%
that you've lost.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Even to the point where
you're blown to bits--

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
they still have
your DNA pattern--

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:90%
they'll put you back together.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It takes time if it's
a major injury where

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
you lost a large portion
like I did of my brain

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:90%
and part of my head.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.103 align:middle line:84%
But it translates back
over into this side.

00:21:28.103 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I have those memories
that come through.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
from that reality.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So they actually put
me back together.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I remember coming
back into my body.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.933 align:middle line:84%
So there's a period
of time where

00:21:38.933 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
if they put you back together
enough so your soul can come

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:90%
back in, it can happen for you.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Now over time, when I
first started the program,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:90%
it had to be within 24 hours.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But there's up to 30 days your
soul can be out of your body

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and still come back.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Now if your soul doesn't
come back in your body,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:90%
your soul has decided to go on.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But normally from
my experience, I

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:84%
remember hanging out and
waiting for them to repair

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:90%
me enough so I could re-enter.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
I'm in a gray area.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
But I have a connection.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:90%
I know they're working.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Get it done, guys,
so I can get back in.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And then I get back in.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like [GASP].

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm back in.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I've had those experiences.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing
happened as a Navy SEAL

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:84%
where I had my
kneecap shattered.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was like that [GASP],,
that pain experience.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So the two are
separate realities.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a reality
as a consciousness,

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:84%
as a soul consciousness
in the space program

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:90%
and in this reality.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So a piece of my soul
is in the space program,

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm having that conscious
connection with it now.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming through
stronger and stronger over time.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you explain
how your soul was actually

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:90%
floating above you?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:90%
You were aware of it, actually.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.762 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Yeah, it's
an interesting thing.

00:22:57.762 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me a little
time to understand that.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
The first part came to
me where I was like, wow.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:90%
They regenerated me.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of being
blown up on several occasions.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I think I've been killed
three or four times.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But I have memories of when
my soul was physically out

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
you're in a dark land.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't see really anything
else, but you have awareness.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
You have an awareness that
is beyond what you normally

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%
have in your physical reality.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.462 align:middle line:84%
I knew because of my
training that they

00:23:32.462 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
were going to put
me back together,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
because I'd seen other
people from my memories that

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
were put back together had
their souls come back in.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So the training
was when you leave,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.898 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason, if you're
killed in combat, remember,

00:23:46.898 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:84%
we're going to put
you back together.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Just hang and get
the connection.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.338 align:middle line:90%
And then when it's time--

00:23:53.338 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
you'll know when the time is--
you'll come back to your body.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.172 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it happened.

00:23:57.172 --> 00:23:58.767 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty impressive.

00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You know,
what you're telling

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
us is that you
are aware that you

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:90%
are in two different places.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:90%
You're bi-locating.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Bi-location.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:90%
That's excellent.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like I'm
bi-located right now.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bi-located
in this reality

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:84%
right now as we're
talking, and I

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
know I'm having an experience in
the space program concurrently.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm becoming more
and more aware of it.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
maybe full recall.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:90%
That's my goal.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do your
other brothers in arms

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
have the same experience
that you have, or is it just

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:90%
your own unique experience?

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.012 align:middle line:84%
Have you actually heard
them talk about it?

00:24:36.012 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: I have never
heard anyone talk about it

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:90%
from my community.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I believe very
strongly that there are

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:90%
many that are involved in it.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of my goals, because
I'm revealing this information,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
is that they might
connect with theirs too.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have the
same kind of memories

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.995 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
through like I do,

00:24:53.995 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and they'll start to
connect with them.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that if more of us
connect with this information,

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:90%
it is going to lift humanity.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of technology
that can help us.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of good
things that happen

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.833 align:middle line:84%
within that side, the space
force, technologies that

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
are hundreds, maybe a thousand
years more advanced than we

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:90%
have right now.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:84%
If more people start to
connect with that like I

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
am as we're starting to see, and
especially from my community,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.392 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'm the front
runner for this.

00:25:23.392 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael, everyone's
talking about the secret space

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Is it really called that?

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Is there something else?

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Absolutely, yeah.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.067 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret space force--

00:25:32.067 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is it?

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.192 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: If you're involved
in it, it's the space force.

00:25:35.192 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
You're just involved
in the space program.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.337 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a program, you
don't really call it that.

00:25:40.337 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the SEAL
Teams, we didn't call

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:90%
ourselves the SEALs, you know?

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:84%
We didn't walk around
saying, we're SEALs.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:90%
We're SEALs.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's totally--
you know, you're--

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Numbers?

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JACO: Yeah, numbers.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.375 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously,
there are numbers.

00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, SEAL Team Six is one
of those pinnacle teams.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in those
pinnacle teams, special forces

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:90%
type in the space program.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So it is a space program
overall as we would look at it

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:90%
and term it.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:90%
There were different categories.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Like when I was in
the time war program,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
we called it the time
wars group, you know?

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:90%
And there was alpha group.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.853 align:middle line:90%
There was bravo group.

00:26:17.853 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Those are my memories.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're not
completely accurate.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to
come through, just

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:90%
like all these memories.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved in many,
many, many different aspects

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved in special
weapons projects, development,

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of different things.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm involved with animals.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.193 align:middle line:84%
So we train with animals
in the space program.

00:26:37.193 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Are they conscious?

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: They're super
conscious, actually.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.475 align:middle line:84%
They're on higher
dimensional realms.

00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not at that
higher dimensional realm,

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.642 align:middle line:90%
you don't work with them.

00:26:45.642 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things like we've

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
talked about earlier with
the conscious connection

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:84%
with ships, with flying
vehicles and so forth,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
with looking glass
technology and so forth.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
If your consciousness
is not raised

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
it's workable,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.643 align:middle line:84%
your vibrations aren't
comparable to whatever

00:27:03.643 --> 00:27:05.810 align:middle line:84%
you're working with, you
don't work with it, period.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
anything to do with you.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.542 align:middle line:90%
You can't connect with it.

00:27:08.542 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing with
working with a lot of animals.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is it telepathy?

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Telepathy is
part of that process,

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:90%
being in the loving vibration.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So the loving
vibration is something

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:90%
I learned when I went to Venus.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So the Venusians are
training us in the program

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
to use these love
energy vibrations.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And we use them--

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
once we started to use
them-- in the early days,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.605 align:middle line:84%
we weren't aware of them
or didn't use them the way

00:27:34.605 --> 00:27:35.480 align:middle line:90%
we're using them now.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But as we're using
them now, we're

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.815 align:middle line:84%
extremely more
effective in our forces.

00:27:40.815 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would you
say that maybe we're

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:90%
being encoded in a way?

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: There is definitely
encoding going on.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:84%
There's technologies
that are used,

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:84%
nanoparticles that come
in and work with us.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Not as we think of now.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So here in our reality, we
hear about nanoparticles

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and we think, oh,
that's evil and stuff.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- you know,
much like anything,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
it can be used
for evil purposes.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But for us, it's
definitely positive.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:90%
They help us think faster.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:90%
They help us heal faster.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:90%
They help us get bigger.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of different
things that nanoparticles do

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:90%
that are very, very positive.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you noticed
that year by year, day by day

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting
that information back,

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're starting to
recall, total recall?

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: The total recall
is definitely accelerating.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It is?

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: I mean, every day
there's more information coming

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the regression
I had here at Gaia

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely amazing.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:90%
It was mind blowing for me.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What else did you
recall from the session?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.515 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Well, I
remember actually

00:28:44.515 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:90%
going to the moon base.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.910 align:middle line:90%
So there is a moon base.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:90%
It's hollow.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.360 align:middle line:90%
It's an artificial structure.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It's come from another
part of the galaxy,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
transporting other
ET races here.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So my memories are
that we flew there.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the transportation was
interesting at the time.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So around nine I believe,
nine to 10 years old,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I remember going out
to the moon base.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was to expose
us to other ET races.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:84%
We'd already had
holograms we looked at.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:90%
We'd seen them in 2D movies.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:90%
We talked about it.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:90%
We'd describe what they're like.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So now we're actually going
to interact with them.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So the transportation at the
time was super high tech.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.780 align:middle line:84%
There was not like we see
the rockets blasting off.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:90%
We were catapulted like from--

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:90%
it's like a tube.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And we were shot
through this tube,

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:90%
and we traveled to the moon.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.260 align:middle line:90%
And there was no propulsion.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.910 align:middle line:90%
We just drifted out.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Caught the gravity.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:84%
We were slingshotted
from the gravity of Earth

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:90%
to the gravity of the moon.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.977 align:middle line:90%
We hooked it and then came in.

00:29:48.977 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
We landed on the far
side of the moon.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We came into a base
where the door was open.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:90%
We went inside.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Now once we're inside, that's
when things got interesting.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:84%
That's when we started
to have our integration.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
We'd already had a little bit of
integration with little grays.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Little grays had come in.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:84%
We'd learn more telepathy
from them, some other skills

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:84%
that they taught us, how to
work with the looking glass

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:90%
technology, and so forth.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we're actually going
to work with big grays,

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:90%
the large grays.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.710 align:middle line:90%
So the large grays are--

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I look at the little grays
as basically being cloned

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:90%
little slaves, unfortunately.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And they basically do
whatever they're told to do.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:90%
The large grays are thinkers.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are
proactive, have free will

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:90%
like we have free will.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're working with us.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So they were kind
of standoffish to us

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.290 align:middle line:90%
because we're not advanced.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So when we worked with
them, it was pretty huff.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
They were very huff
with us, very gruff.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it was.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Really, all the different
ETs that we saw in there.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And I saw many different types.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
They usually had their
own areas inside there.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:90%
We had our own area.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Over time, we started
to integrate with them

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:90%
more and more and more.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.340 align:middle line:84%
There's large cities
inside the moon

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and different sized cities
throughout the moon.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So you traveled to
each one of them,

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:84%
but normally only on
invite because there's

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
ET races that have their
own little areas in there.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the same, as
I would learn later,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.620 align:middle line:90%
it is in many of the planets.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.218 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like little
different countries inside.

00:31:22.218 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JACO: Excellent
way to describe it.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's different countries,
and ETs have their countries.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're
invited to their country

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:84%
to train with them or
interact with them.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we share
information with them.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But more often, they
share information with us,

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:90%
at least at that time frame.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
From 12 to 17, I remember going
back and forth from bases in--

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.460 align:middle line:84%
DUMB bases in the US
and back and forth.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So I never really
had much interaction

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
once I turned three and four
years old with the servants

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
All I remember is just
doing underground bases.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:84%
But those bases were
like massive cities

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.810 align:middle line:84%
sometimes that we
see on the surface.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Michael,
fascinating information.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.382 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.
