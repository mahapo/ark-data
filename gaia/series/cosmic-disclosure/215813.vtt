>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by
Victoria Whitney,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:10%
a doctor of science and a
retired member of the Department

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:10%
of Defense, United States Navy.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're discussing
Andromedan technologies.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Victoria, welcome
to the show again.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.752 align:middle line:90%
>> VICTORIA WHITNEY: Hi, Emery.

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So let's
talk about this.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
What was your first experience
with some of these technologies?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: With the
technologies, well,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I've seen technologies probably
most of my life because I've had

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
experiences with many
different species.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: But there's a
difference between seeing it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a difference of
seeing it used in many different

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And so for the Andromedans,
when I first met them,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%
they were very
standoffish, did not want

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:90%
to commit to conversations.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't until
Zendor, who was

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:10%
their captain for that conclave,
had a conversation with them,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:10%
and then suddenly
they were different.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe it has something
to do with him explaining

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to them that they came to me
because I was a gold light.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So everything
changed after that,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and they were more
willing to share things.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So we had many, many
discussions about their life,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and they very much--
technology is their forte.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
They incorporated
it as much as they

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.070 align:middle line:84%
can into not only their
living environments,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:84%
but all of their spacecraft,
their education, literally

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So just like everybody
else, they have cities.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:10%
But in the difference of this
we have Xeronne and Kitanne,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:10%
pilot navigator.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:10%
I've said before that they
were bred for their positions,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:10%
and this really takes
on a whole new meaning

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:10%
when you start learning
how they live their lives.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:10%
They were both bred
aboard the Cyrillian,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:10%
which is a commercialized
sector spaceport.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:10%
Very large, over 2,000
miles in diameter.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:10%
That's about as big as our moon.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were bred in the,
what they call CP units.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're labeled 1 and 2, 3
and 4, so there's pairs of them.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So they're bred two at a
time and their energies

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:90%
are totally in-sync.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that's
an interesting concept.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's
specific for the ship?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: That-- well, this
was specific for what their need

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So they breed them according
to what their need is.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to be that
they have a class of ships, so

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:84%
the M Class of ship that is
very popular amongst them,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
they needed pilots
and navigators.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So the two of them were
bred for that class ship.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that they have
the technology, the download

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their craft.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So they can literally get
into anything and fly it,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and they understand the
mechanics of it and everything.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is, so they're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:90%
bred from a particular lineage.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So as pure a lineage as
the Andromedans can get,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that's what creates the basis or
foundation for what they call--

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.227 align:middle line:84%
they're considered a
natural part of this.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
They have two things
because they also

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
breed for cyborgs and
androids and things like that.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:90%
More a cloning process.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:90%
But these two are not cloned.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
They're actually what they
call a natural or natal pact,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
in which they use the lineage
from the original Andromedans

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:90%
to form their existence.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when they come
out of this unit,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
they come out as almost
equivalent to a 25-year-old.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're blank slates.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is during the process,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.177 align:middle line:84%
they're embedded with AI
technologies such as modules

00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and things, so that
they can interface

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:90%
with other AI technologies.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they take them in
to get their programming.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they program them
for many different things.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:90%
So, like I say, they can fly--

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.982 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Why just two of them?

00:04:03.982 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: In pairs,
they look at it and say,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
look at it like you have
to halves of a brain.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.768 align:middle line:84%
And together, you
can do great things.

00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they look.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
These are the two
halves, and together they

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:90%
can do great things.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And they interface
with their ship

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
or they can interface
with any AI technology.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that they
program them for what they need.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When you say program,
is that we're learning something

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.777 align:middle line:84%
or is it more like circuitry,
like transhumanism?

00:04:33.777 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: It's not--
it's not like trans--

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
there are cyborgs and androids
are more like transhumanism.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:90%
But for them, they take them in.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're very
much organic, like us,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:84%
but they take them in and they
decide what programs they need.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
They put them in these pods
and it's instantaneous.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And they get whatever types
of programs they need,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
whether it's diplomacy or,
like I say, flying these craft

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case is.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They get downloaded
with this programming.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the next phase is once
they've had all their downloads,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:84%
then they go to what
they call betas.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the betas,
they're learning

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
to act more human
characteristics, so to speak.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't have that.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had
the experiences.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they don't
have that much emotion then?

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Right.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:90%
No emotion whatsoever.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's why people think
they're so stern and everything,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is because they're
just matter of fact.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And so it's interesting to see--

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I've asked them, what
about relationships?

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a relationship
between the two of them.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Can they have relationships
outside of that?

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at me and
just laughed and said, why?

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.643 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: And I
mean, are you complete?

00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Is that what that
means, is you're

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
complete just having this other
entity that is a like energy.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.138 align:middle line:90%
Do you need anything else?

00:05:55.138 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they're just
bred just for that spaceship?

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yes, Yes.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
If it was engineering,
they would

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:84%
have some that are bred
just for engineering

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case may be.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And so getting to know
these two was interesting.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And what they said
when they came

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
was that pilot and navigation,
but they were also the security.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They were there to protect
the rest of the conclave.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And, so they've had downloads
of tactical experience.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.365 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking one time
about, because my grandson wants

00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
to-- he thinks it'd be great
just to go in and plug it in

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and you know all
the martial arts.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at me like,
what's wrong with that?

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:90%
How do you think we got there?

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of that program.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.025 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can they operate
multiple ships at the same time?

00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: They're capable of
interfacing with multiple ships.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So remember, their ship
can split into three.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
their bio-organics.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Right, so they can control all
three of them at the same time.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting
because can we do that?

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Our brains don't allow us to--
we're good with one or two

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
things, but if we start getting
three or four, it falls apart.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting
that they can do that.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is they
don't need controls,

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
they don't need
physical controls.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:90%
All they need to do is think it.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And that interface
is right there.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:90%
So everything was holographic.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So they become part
of that hologram

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to
interface with it

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
on a level in which we couldn't
even begin to understand.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, they're
interesting people,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:90%
highly intelligent.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So is that part of
the programming?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Or is that something that
once they get the programming,

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:90%
they evolve to that?

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.595 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
They do get some
programming that tells them

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
about the universal source and
why it's so important to them

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and that that's
their spirituality.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So they come in with
that core belief.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Who chooses that?

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, apparently,
that's the Andromedan Council

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So they don't consider
themselves an empire.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Their formal government is
their Andromedan Council.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they
are constantly doing what's

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:90%
best for the Andromeda species.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So given that, they will host
these natal pacts or beings

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
being created in
order to meet needs

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:90%
within the Andromedan society.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So, like I say, if
they need engineers

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
any, here what we do

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
is we send kids to school
for a couple of years

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to become an engineer, and they
flood the market or the school

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:90%
with lots of engineers.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, you're
either dry or you're too many.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
There, it's just
exactly what they need.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
different concept

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create
what you need.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
relationships then,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:84%
we're talking something
totally different.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Because our understanding
of a relationship

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and their understanding is two
opposite ends of the scale.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you mentioned
natural reproduction earlier.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.452 align:middle line:84%
Is there any artificial
reproduction going on?

00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Well, sure.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we talked about the fact
that androids and cyborgs, OK.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
In their classification
things, we look at that on TV

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:90%
and we still see a robot.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
But for them, it is very
much a living being.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It's autonomous, can think
for itself, make decisions.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It's still part
of their society.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:90%
But yet it's something that--

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
it's an artificial
reproduction of what that is.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't use any of
their lineage material

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:90%
in order to create that.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a
biological in any way.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It may have some biological
parts because at one point,

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:90%
Xeronne showed me a picture.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And what it looked like
was a biological face,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
but then all these mechanical
parts attached to it.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And we would look at
something like that

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, what is that?

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But to them, that's just
another species of them,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
one that they have created
for specific purposes.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure what
all those purposes are.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really get
too much into that,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
but that's a normal
course of action.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They interact with them just
like it was any other species.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that would very much
be an artificial reproduction

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And they don't call it cloning.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That word is a horrible word for
them because I, at one point,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned that.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, so you're
actually cloning.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
And they said that's offensive.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I have
a lack of understanding

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:90%
of what that is then.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said cloning
is by taking the DNA

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
and mixing it with other DNAs.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:90%
And they said, that's impure.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, I'll take
it for what it's worth,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:84%
but that's not a
word that they use.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:84%
They use this natal pact
which says that it's

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:90%
a pure lineage of DNA.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:90%
And not necessarily DNA.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even sure if that's
how we would classify it.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: But they're growing.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.515 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: But
they're growing, right.

00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And they grow full size.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't go through an infant
stage, which is interesting.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And they grow full size, and
they equate it to about being

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
the age of a 25-year-old
when they come out.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they live
for 1,500 to 2,000 years.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they go
through this process

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in which that body gets
reclaimed and renewed

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:90%
into something else.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.292 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so.

00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is that all
done in those pods?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: In the
CP chambers, right.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like, if
you've seen Star Trek,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.442 align:middle line:84%
you've seen these big
cased beds on there.

00:11:37.442 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
it looked like.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting is
when they were showing me,

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:90%
they're paired.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.105 align:middle line:84%
So the ones that they were in,
they took pictures because we--

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.963 align:middle line:90%
We have a newborn.

00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody takes
pictures of the newborn.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what happens

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:90%
is they record that event.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And so here was their
chamber 01 and 02.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's them paired.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And then it just goes down.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:84%
They say there's just
about 100 chambers.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How long does that
take for that person to grow?

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.782 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, that's
what I asked them.

00:12:10.782 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting is they're
named by their lineage and then

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:90%
a star date.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:90%
That's who they are.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.977 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a last name.

00:12:16.977 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's a name by their
lineage and then a star date.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And then according to them,
it took 56 days for that body

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to be released from
the CP chamber.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And then like I say, they come
out, they're a blank slate.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's interesting
because how do they--

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:84%
they must have to put them on
a cart and take them someplace.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
a blank slate, how

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.495 align:middle line:84%
do you get the body to start
moving and doing things?

00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah, how is it--

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.050 align:middle line:84%
don't they stimulate
it in any way?

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: It apparently not.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
What it goes for is
this programming next.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, like I say, it
receives whatever programming.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And according to them, it is
a large volume of programming

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.783 align:middle line:90%
that they receive.

00:12:55.783 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How long
does that take?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So they
say it takes a day.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So they take them in there
for a day and program them.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
they go into another part

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Space Station
because they're

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:90%
raised on a Space Station.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So they go to this other
part of the Space Station,

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
the betas are at.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And then it's basically
a training session.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:90%
How do you conduct yourself?

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They are learning how
to use their programming

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:90%
in various ways.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
graduate from the betas,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and then they go into a cycle
where they become the teacher

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to the next set of
betas, so that they're

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:90%
seeing both sides of that.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.217 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
they're assigned someplace.

00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What can you tell
us about the space stations?

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Are they government?

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.588 align:middle line:90%
Are they private?

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, I can
tell you lots about them.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So they have what they call
commercialized sector space

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:90%
stations.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
one, the Cyrillian

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is the one that
Xeronne and Kitanne--

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Cyrillian?

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.567 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Cyrillian.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:84%
That belongs to the
Andromedan Council.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They run all of the
commercialized sector.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones that
are doing mining or building

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:90%
other ships or biospheres.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.283 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How big
are we talking here?

00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So it's a little
over 2,100 miles across.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just the size
of a moon almost.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:10%
>> WHITNEY: And
they live on there.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:10%
The two of them had never
set foot in a city to live.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:10%
They had visited cities,
but they were never

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:10%
living in a city.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
They just lived totally
on the space station.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
private ones, and there

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
are some private ones that they
use for commercial development.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But they said for
the majority of them,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
the private ones are like hotels
and gaming and entertainment

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:90%
and different things like that.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're spaced all
throughout the constellation,

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.308 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting
because we've all seen--

00:14:47.308 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did they move
around or are they stay--

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: They can
move around, yeah.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They can move around.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah, so if they're
doing a big biosphere like

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
a planet-sized biosphere,
then several of them will come

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.248 align:middle line:90%
together and support.

00:14:57.248 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And why would
they be doing that?

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: To build
biospheres or to move around?

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: To build
the biospheres?

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.608 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, so there
are entities like in part

00:15:05.608 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of our vision, that's what they
said, we were on a biosphere.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.983 align:middle line:84%
The Omicron Commonwealth
was on a biosphere.

00:15:09.983 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, somebody
has to build that.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
technology here.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They're known for
being the master builders.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: They're master
shipbuilders, yes, yes.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of
the species, that's

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
where they go to get their
cruisers and different things

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:90%
is through the Andromedans.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:10%
And they're all technology
every step of the way.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:10%
They don't talk about
their weapon systems,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.258 align:middle line:10%
which I understand that.

00:15:35.258 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But they're really
cocky about being proud of these

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Indeed, indeed,
nobody does it better.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:90%
So I was reminded frequently.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's basically what it is.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are there different
ships for different jobs?

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yes.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So they have this
one that they work

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
on is what they call a Class
M. I don't know what that

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.735 align:middle line:90%
means in the scheme of things.

00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
go through and say

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:90%
A, B, C, D, I don't know.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But they call this
a Class M ship.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So we had a picture of
what it looked like.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a smaller vessel it allows
them to go both interstellar

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and interplanetary,
which means that it

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
has some type of system to adapt
between those changes in density

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:90%
and gravities.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:84%
It also has what they call
a fission fusion chamber.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the power that it
stores, it has collectors on it.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So they come up like
big sails, and it's

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
collecting star
particle material

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and then converting
it to energy.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they use.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:90%
So they never run out of it.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And they say that they can
feel when the ship needs

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:90%
to have its sails lifted.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:90%
They felt when their ship was--

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.145 align:middle line:90%
they got into a--

00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Like solar sails?

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.895 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Solar
sails sort of, right.

00:16:54.895 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:84%
It looks like dragon wings that
came up with hexagon-shaped.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
is their ship

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
was shot with some type of
plasma beam and received a gash,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and all three of them felt it.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
And then it began
to repair itself.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And at some point Kitanne
said, we're almost healed,

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.918 align:middle line:84%
including themselves
in that statement.

00:17:20.918 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought
that was interesting

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that that's how close
that relationship is

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:90%
between all of them.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How does this ship
get the energy to heal itself?

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So because
it's a conscious being,

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.107 align:middle line:90%
it has a frequency.

00:17:35.107 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK, makes sense.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And just healing just
comes natural to it.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And both Kitanne and
Xeronne believe in healing.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's just a natural
function of that, prime core

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
belief, is that
everything is energy.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the ship started
the healing process,

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
but they were very aware
of the healing process.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How old
are these ships?

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, the one
that they have is fairly new

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
because they were bred at the
same time the ship was made.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know their true age
right now because I don't know

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.250 align:middle line:90%
when that 25-mark hit for them.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when they were
brought into service, so

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:90%
to speak.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned
this Class M craft.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.755 align:middle line:84%
Why would they use
our alphabet for that?

00:18:18.755 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, I think that
was for our understanding.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: I think that
probably they would have called

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
it something else and we would
have been confused as to what

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:90%
that means.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.688 align:middle line:84%
So they gave us
something in which

00:18:29.688 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
we could reference and have
an understanding, because I

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:90%
didn't question that.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what that means.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to give us
things that are referenced,

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.647 align:middle line:90%
that we can understand.

00:18:39.647 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the
working relationship between

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.248 align:middle line:84%
the Andromedan Council and
the Galactic Federation?

00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, they
have a really good working

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they have formal
agreements between them.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Federation
has a formal set

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:90%
of directives that they follow.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So that would mean that
the Andromedan Council

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:90%
has agreed to those directives.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens if somebody
outside of the Federation

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:90%
decides that they want to ship?

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is business.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So they would come in
and probably just like

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.860 align:middle line:84%
anything else, have
a meeting, discuss

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
what that is, who's going to pay
what, and then go from there.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.762 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they had
some determination

00:19:23.762 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to
use that craft for that

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
may be detrimental to a society
that's part of the Federation,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
then it would behoove
them not to go down

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.322 align:middle line:84%
that route because they
do have this agreement.

00:19:35.322 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Who decides--

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:90%
who decides that?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well,
that's what the Council.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So the Council gets
involved with that

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go to the
Federation, apparently.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.813 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen
that where that's

00:19:44.813 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
happened, where they've
gone and they've

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:84%
had these huge sessions where
they've talked about things

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and decided what's the
best course of action.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.228 align:middle line:84%
And if it has anything to do
with their prime directive,

00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, they'll go in
and they'll check that first

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, we cannot
do this because, and then

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
they'll state what that
prime directive is.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
diplomatic in that way.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
probably the easiest

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.365 align:middle line:84%
way to resolve any tensions
between people will say,

00:20:14.365 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
well, look, we
just can't do this

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.422 align:middle line:84%
because our prime
directive says this.

00:20:17.422 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:90%
They're very cognizant.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --of time, Victoria,
where people or different

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.268 align:middle line:84%
species are both purchasing
like the same craft--

00:20:25.268 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Oh, I'm sure.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And using
maybe against each other?

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: I'm sure
that's probably happened.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.768 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
going to go and say,

00:20:32.768 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm going to
purchase this craft

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:84%
because I want to go commit
war over here with so and so,

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:84%
What you're going to do is
say, I have a need for a craft

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to be--

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:84%
remember, they're
telepathic so they can sit.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So what does that mean you have
to do in your consciousness?

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It means that you have to be
as upfront and truthful as you

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:90%
can be.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So are they going to sense
that you're being deceitful?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
being deceitful,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to
go down that path.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But if they feel like, you're
being truthful with them

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and what have you that I'm
sure they would probably

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:90%
acquiesce to building it.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But I also noticed
that they don't

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
have a large membership of
purchasers in spacecraft

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that it seems to be
the same entities purchasing

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
craft for whatever purpose,
whether it's for cargo

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.337 align:middle line:90%
or passengers or whatever.

00:21:26.337 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, specific for that.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.375 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Exactly, exactly.

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Duty, yeah.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you come down
to these cruiser classes,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
because what are
cruisers meant for?

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're meant for
deterrence of conflict.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And so do they have people
that are purchasing those?

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but usually it's
the fleet services

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:90%
that belong to the Federation.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they've
made this pact that as long

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:84%
as they're willing to put
this out there and say,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:84%
we're offering an appearance
of security that's

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:90%
beneficial to all.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The pilots that
are bred for other craft.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Do they have any other
special enhancements?

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: Oh, sure.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:90%
They're stronger, faster.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah,
they're so agile.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a day where we watched
the two of them practicing hand

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:90%
to hand combat.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
They're equally matched
because they're same energies.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow, that's right.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: And to
watch them move and see,

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:37.913 align:middle line:84%
they can jump higher than
we can jump, run faster.

00:22:37.913 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
just no comparison

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
between what we can do
and what they can do.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But they also have
enhancements within the ship.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they're interfacing
with this bio-organic ship

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:90%
because it's one unit now.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.285 align:middle line:84%
Just in the thinking alone,
there isn't any manual controls

00:22:54.285 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that they're having
to deal with.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So just in the
thinking alone, that

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.312 align:middle line:84%
means that they
have to be sharper.

00:22:59.312 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It means that they
have to be able to see

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
what the outcome is going to
be before it ever happens.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there's, I think,
a lot of that intellect

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that is transpiring between
both the ship and the pilot

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and the navigator to be able to
foresee movements and actions

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
that we normally wouldn't

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:90%
take into consideration.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did they mention
anything about social bonds,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
not just between each other,
but between them and the ship

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well, when
they split into three,

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting, and that's
usually during a period where

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:84%
if they're being
faced with a threat,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:84%
they will split into three,
because if it's one target,

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:90%
easier to hit.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:84%
If it's three targets,
it's much harder to hit.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.748 align:middle line:90%
And so they're still in contact.

00:23:45.748 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:90%
There's only two of them.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
That means one of them doesn't
have a physical contact.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's still part of
the system of being interfaced

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:90%
with the two of them.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they can coordinate
that whole thing.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And if something happens,
like I say, the ship was hit.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:90%
It was then split into three.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.710 align:middle line:84%
One section of it was hit,
but all of them felt it.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And then when they came
back together, and he said,

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:90%
there was empathy amongst them.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.107 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when was the last
time you got in your car

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.760 align:middle line:90%
and it had empathy for you?

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So that was really a
big thing to realize

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that this living
consciousness really

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:90%
has a relationship with them.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And that relationship
goes beyond just being

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:90%
able to fly around as a craft.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the conscious
came in after it was built.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Yeah,
fascinating stuff.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I would love to be--

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I've been in their ship.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I've interfaced with it.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is that
it'll say what type of voice

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:90%
would you like to hear.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Like, maybe that's
an effect upon us, right?

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't give it
any thought whatsoever.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:90%
I have an Alexa, right?

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't care which voice she
uses, just as long as she

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:90%
does what she's supposed to do.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But for that, it
was concerned that

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
in providing me
with a voice that

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:90%
would help me to understand it.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought that was
very intuitive on its part

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to be able to even
think of that.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:90%
That's just not something we do.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are the Andromedans
involved with Earth and humans

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:90%
at this time?

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: So let's
clarify that for a moment.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WHITNEY: OK.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So involvement can be
in many different forms.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:90%
So let's say that--

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
we'll say Class A
is full involvement.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:84%
We're doing everything we can
to telepathically reach out

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:47.135 align:middle line:84%
to different humans or that
we're making visitations to them

00:25:47.135 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the most heightened
form of being involved.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Then class B would be that
we need you to do something

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and so we're going to
download that to you.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:90%
So people get downloads then.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And then C is we're here but
we're not bothered with you.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of
fall in the C Class.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We're here, but it's not our
job to take you anywhere.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to do what
we're here to do.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So hence, the pilot
and the navigator

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
were here to
protect the conclave

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and transport them
where they needed to go.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't to interface with us.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It just happened to be by
accident that they wound up

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:90%
having to interface.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They sound
like an amazing race.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: I agree, I think
that they're very amazing and I

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.410 align:middle line:84%
think that they've got
so much to offer us.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:84%
We just need to be
paying attention.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sounds good.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, Victoria, thank you
for being on the show.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WHITNEY: Well,
you're welcome.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith,
and this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
