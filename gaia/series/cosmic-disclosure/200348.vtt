00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are talking about

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:10%
interplanetary beings
with Randy Cramer.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>> How you doing, Emery?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, there are many people
that believe there are beings

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:84%
living in Inner Earth, and
not only on Inner Earth,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
but other planets Inner Earth,
what do you know about this?

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, there absolutely are, and
it turns out that the honeycomb

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:10%
structure that we have
underneath the surface

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:10%
of the crust, which creates
these large pockets,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:10%
is something that happens a lot.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Most planets have magma
activity, molten rock activity

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
under the surface, that
create these pockets

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and form them over time.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have these, in some
cases pockets of space

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that are larger than
the state of Nevada,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
in a pocket that's that big
so you can't see from one end

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to the other it's so large,
so they become incredibly safe

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
from surface
destructive efforts.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you
can't get wiped out

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:84%
by a hurricane, or a tornado,
or a flood in these areas

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
because they're
protected against that.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's not uncommon for
species to move underground

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.038 align:middle line:84%
either when necessary, or
just as the notion of, hey,

00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe we should do this
because we have the ability to.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a safer,
more secure place.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It's also safer and more
secure from a hostile force

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:90%
or an invasion.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, a
hostile force could

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
land on the surface of a
planet, and invade the surface,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and not be able to find
the entrances that might

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:90%
lead to an interior place.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.022 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very strong defensive
position, interior of a planet.

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So it doesn't have
its own atmosphere?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Is it just full of water?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a multitude of
different types of atmospheres?

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
>> It varies quite a bit.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way that we
have the caverns that you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:84%
can get to from
the surface, which

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
can have breathable oxygen, or
water, or methane, or ammonia,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
or chlorine gas, so
you have the same kind

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of pockets underneath
the surface

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:90%
as well in the honeycomb.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a big pocket
that's breathable atmosphere,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:84%
or you can have a big
pocket that's chlorine gas

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and would kill you
if you were in it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:90%
without an environment suit.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredibly varied
environment down there,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
more varied than people
would imagine it to be.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Now on a previous episode,
you and I were talking about

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.417 align:middle line:84%
these large and weird beings,
and things that live down

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:84%
there, and the viewers have been
writing in and they said if I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
ever get you back on this show,
let's jump in and go deep here,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:90%
and no pun intended--

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What is down there.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Giant monsters.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And who are they,
and why are they here.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They're a natural defense
mechanism from the planet.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
They've been here longer
than any of us have,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
or since before
the dinosaurs even.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
These are creatures that go back
millions of years potentially,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and have been living there
for a very, very long time.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
My personal encounter with them
is they're highly intelligent.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
They're not animals,
unintelligent animals,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:90%
or beasts.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
They're highly intelligent.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But by looking at them,
you might refer to them

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:90%
as a beast or a monster.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you
a living creature

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that's 200 or 300 feet
tall, that's several

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
thousand or million years
old has a consciousness that

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
probably defies understanding
from me or you anyway.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> How long have they been here?

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Millions of years.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Probably even maybe since
the beginning of the planet.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you give me an example
of what one of these giants

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:90%
look like?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I've only had one personal
experience that I can relate.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
While I have been
briefed on the subject

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and I could describe
a few other things,

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I only have one
personal experience

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that I was there for,
saw with my own eyes,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and experienced with
my own five senses.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
imagine something

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
that resembles a
big furry primate,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe like a sloth that
walks on its hands,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and is covered with hair that
looks like giant dreadlocks.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you can imagine
a strand of woven hair

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that's about 3 or 4 feet
in diameter or more,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and over 100 feet
long, that starts

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
whipping through the
air, and that's not

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
like getting hit
with a dreadlock.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be getting
hit like with a 20 ton cable.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So it has the ability to
basically swirl and spin

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
its body in such a way that
these hairs go flying around

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and would knock
out aircraft if you

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
were trying to attack it
with helicopters, or jets,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.188 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:05:16.188 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
It could knock a
plane out of the sky,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
or crush a tank probably,
or something like that.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly how
tall do you think--

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:90%
could you estimate?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I would estimate that it was
probably between 250 and 300

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:90%
feet tall.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
This is definitely in
the deep, deep pockets.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So we consider the
network in which

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
some of these other species,
of the shorter, more our size

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
ones, we refer to that often
as the Argartha Network.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
There is a deeper set
of pockets that we

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:90%
think of as deeper than that.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's where these things
live, in an even deeper pocket,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
or series of pockets.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> How do they grow to
such an extreme size,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and why aren't we not
seeing them on the surface?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think we're talking
about pre-primordial time,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
so were talking about before
the dinosaurs when plants

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.567 align:middle line:90%
and animals were even larger.

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think were just talking
about that came from a time

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
when biological life
was grew bigger.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean we don't have--

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
if we had a brontosaurus that
we could genetically engineer

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and bring to life, it
would starve to death,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:84%
because there simply
aren't plants that

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:90%
grow big enough for it to eat.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It would need a bigger food
source of bigger vegetation.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And the mineral content
was much higher back then,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and the atmosphere was thicker,
so the radiation, you know--

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> All factors that would
dictate what biological life

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
would look like, and
what its characteristics

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
of survivability would be.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think they have
lungs and they're breathing

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:90%
the atmosphere down there or--

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You can hear them breathing
when you're close to them.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.235 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
distinctive characteristics

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:90%
is you can hear them breathing.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the smells.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you notice that smell?

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Really, likes the stinkiest
primate that you could imagine,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:90%
because it's large.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it ever bathes.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.692 align:middle line:90%
Very smelly.

00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> What was your personal
experience with it that you

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:90%
had?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know how comfortable
I am discussing that completely

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and intricately.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say that it
became a requirement for me

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
that I had to get to
a certain place, which

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.695 align:middle line:90%
was across this expanse.

00:07:31.695 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
that I was going

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
to get across this expanse,
was if I rode on something

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:90%
that could walk that expanse.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.402 align:middle line:84%
And it's a complicated story how
that all went down, but, yeah,

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:45.860 align:middle line:84%
there was something
going on there.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it positive or negative?

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Very positive.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Terrifying.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely terrifying.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Crap my pants terrifying,
but very positive.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there others
like you that were there?

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.720 align:middle line:84%
None that I could
see or were aware of.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It was very dark.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think so.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.912 align:middle line:84%
I think it was not a place
where humans or other beings

00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
would want to go, because
you'd get stepped on.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
realize you enter

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
into a cavern where you're
this big compared to something

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.342 align:middle line:84%
that's this big,
it's terrifying,

00:08:14.342 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:84%
because all of a
sudden you realize

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I could get stepped
on at any second here.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's a whole other kind
of biological concern.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of made me
think, oh, so this

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
is what a mouse
feels like when it's

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:90%
running through the kitchen.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
Did you make a
connection with it,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
or were you just being
really careful when

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
you were walking
through this expanse,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and was this expanse
in Inner Earth?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I had to--

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I had to sit and do
a meditative exercise

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with this
being, or essentially

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with the being
that responded to my request

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:90%
for a ride.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one
that showed up, so--

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you see in there?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Was it lit up?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Was it--

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It was incredibly dark.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I had maybe, with the
light source that I had,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:90%
20 or 30 foot visibility radius.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:90%
I could see, but not very far.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you able to go
up and touch this being?

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed onto one of
those big giant hairs

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and rode it across it.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.785 align:middle line:84%
>> And you rode it across just
like a flea on a dog was trying

00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:23.585 align:middle line:90%
to get somewhere.

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty much.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> With his permission.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I wouldn't, I don't
think I would have been allowed

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:90%
to without his permission.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So I had to ask nice,
and he apparently

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:90%
was cool with that, and--

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What was that purpose
of traversing this area?

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Was it just because there
no way to get across it,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
because you're just too small?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there was no other--
no way to have a vehicle,

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
or a ship, or a motorcycle,
or anything else to ride.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It was either going to walk,
which was not feasible,

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
or get a ride, and I was told
that that was the protocol.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
that if one had to make
this journey, that was

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:90%
the way that it had to be made.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So the protocol came
down from who and where?

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Just from your training?

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> From my superiors,
but from my superiors,

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
they got the information
from the Raptors.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any
foliage in the area,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
or anything else that stood
out, like lakes, or rivers,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:90%
or waterfalls.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing that I could
see or came close to.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be a incredibly
large, empty cavern

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
of dark rock.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see or smell water,
vegetation of any kind

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:90%
that I can recall.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they debrief you on
what they were doing there,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:90%
this specific giant creature?

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that
I got a debriefing.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I got
the full debriefing,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
but I got a debriefing
on the subject.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there others down
there or was it just this one

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:90%
creature?

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>> There were many others.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Most of them I couldn't
see as they would pass by,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
but you could hear
the steps, very loud,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:90%
and, again, the breathing.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So imagine being in the dark,
and hearing something walk

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and breathe that is so large
you can feel every footstep,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel warm
air when it exhales.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Stinky warm air.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How many you think
were in there just by--

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I know you have to guess
because you couldn't see.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm guessing
dozens or hundreds.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And what type of uniform
or protective gear were you

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:90%
wearing?

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Next to none, to
be honest with you.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Pretty standard
BDU style uniform.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have any
special equipment on you.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This particular, I was not
allowed anything other than

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:90%
a flashlight.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I was told that if I
was carrying a weapon,

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I could be considered a
threat and get stomped on.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So I was given no
weapons of any kind, not

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.798 align:middle line:90%
a knife, not anything.

00:11:56.798 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you feel about that?

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Terrified.

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> That must have been
one important mission.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It was very important.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Life or death.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give us
a little bit more?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Like--

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, OK.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, well these
beings seem pretty amazing.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Have you been to other parts
in Inner Earth where there

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
were more humanoid beings
or extraterrestrials

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that you would run
into now and then?

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the shallower
layer of the Argartha Network

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:90%
has the--

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
we sort of think of them
as the post-Atlanteans

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So when Atlantis broke
up, a lot of people

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
went to the four corners of the
Earth, as well as underground.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So a good number of what we
think of as these tall Nordics,

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
are really like
Atlantean ancestors.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's get into
these other beings,

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and some of the ones
you worked with.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Are they equally advanced to
us, or are they more primitive?

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say most of them
are as advanced or more so.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that different
species from different places

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
focus differently on
different technologies,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
so you don't necessarily go
from place to place and find

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%
uniform advancements.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You can find different ways.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The different species will
use cellular regeneration

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:84%
The different ways
in which species

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:84%
use computer, memory
storage technology.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Different ways in which they
use create light sources,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:90%
heating sources.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So you have just so
many different ways

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
in which the
fingerprint of a species

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
sort of leaves itself with
the technology that it uses.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
question to ask,

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:84%
because I would say while
some of the technology

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
that some of these
species have is clearly

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
more advanced than what we're
using at the moment, some

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:90%
of them not so much.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, a lot of species
develop something

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and go, OK, that's good.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And then if there's no need to
develop something beyond that,

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
because that's completely
functional, then they don't.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So, again, sometimes
we find things

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that we've gone decades or
centuries ahead of someone,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're constantly trying
to make something better,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
versus maybe some
species that got

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:84%
a technology from another
more advanced species

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're still trying to
figure out how to crack.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give us some
comparisons or explain what

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:90%
some of this technology is?

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, so
these tall Nordics,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
they use a regeneration
technology that's basically

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:90%
a crystal bed.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this giant
crystal bed and chamber,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and you slide someone in it.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, they refract some
light through the crystal.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, it does
something super magical

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and restores anything
and everything.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty interesting.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you studied this device?

00:14:57.947 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I haven't studied them.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I've looked at one.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It was very fascinating.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.200 align:middle line:90%
I was completely intrigued.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's get into more detail
about these tall Nordic beings.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Like what do they look like?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say they tend to be in
about six 6 and 1/2 feet tall.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Their variation
in eye color tends

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to be blue, green,
lighter colors.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Don't tend to see too many dark
brown or darker colored pupils.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be lighter colors.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Some of that probably is
living subterranean as well.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of the pale skin
is probably from that.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Even though they do have
these artificial fusion

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
devices, which is essentially
an artificial sun stuck up

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:84%
in the ceiling somewhere, it's
often still not quite the same

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:90%
as living on the surface.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They tend to wear
robes, which is

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:84%
the standard intergalactic wear,
because it's easiest to make.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.518 align:middle line:90%
It's comfortable.

00:15:50.518 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
They're not so fashion forward.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they look in shape?

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they more rounder,
more skinnier?

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> They seem actually really
skinny and lean to me,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
they like they don't have a
lot of muscle mass or muscle

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:90%
development on there.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I would presume, and
this might not be true,

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I would presume that
in a wrestling match,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I would win hands down
in a physical match up.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure that
that's 100% correct.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What do they eat and
what's their customs?

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Mostly vegetarian
diet, apparently.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:84%
They're super big on
growing their own food

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and eating mostly vegetable
matter, mushrooms, fungi,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:90%
stuff like that.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:90%
They're not big on meat.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> How are they growing this
food underground without

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:90%
the sun?

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, artificial fusion
device, which acts as a sun.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Does the same thing so
that you get full spectrum

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
light that can, again, grow
plants, spinach, broccoli,

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:90%
so forth.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've been exposed to
a lot of the white papers from

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:84%
down there that they're
using chemo genesis,

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
which is the chemicals and
minerals from the Earth

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.080 align:middle line:90%
to sustain life.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Did these beings have--

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
do they know about
the other beings,

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and did they ever interact
with other Inner Earth being,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
or are they just kind
of compartmentalized

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:90%
to this section of the planet.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, they're pretty
aware of the others.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
There's some
territorialism, so there

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
tend to be areas in which the
Nordics live, and the Raptors.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
The Raptors don't tend
to like other people

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
in their territory,
and let's just say

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:29.360 align:middle line:84%
the civilians among the Raptors,
might find you tasty as food

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.808 align:middle line:84%
if you did. so
you're not advised

00:17:30.808 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to wander into their
territory, because you

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:90%
might end up on the menu.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a thing
that they eat people.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a thing that if
you wander into their territory,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
it's like a pig wandering
to your front lawn

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, bacon.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think
they're there?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they've been there
longer than we have.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
They're evolved from
some dinosaur species,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:84%
so they evolved hundreds
of millions of years

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:90%
here before we did.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they have--

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about all
the beings we've mentioned,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and you can start
with any of them,

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:84%
do they have access to Terra,
to the Earth's surface?

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way for
them to come up?

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they have access,
but in the same way

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that not every person on
the surface gets to go down,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
not everybody who lives
down there gets to come up.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So there is a barrier.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to be allowed to go
from up here to down there,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be
allowed to come up

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:90%
from down there to up here.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.872 align:middle line:84%
>> On one of my investigations
that I did on my own,

00:18:33.872 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:84%
when I was younger
in the military,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
was trying to figure out how
these giant sea creatures were

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:90%
traversing the Earth's oceans.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of any
under water, under the Earth,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
giant trail systems that
they could get through?

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure of the
exact time and date

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:84%
this was, but recently, last
few years or something, NASA

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
comes out and says, we have
discovered oceans of water

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
under the oceans
that have more water

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:90%
than the oceans have in them.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's gotta be a
circulatory system there,

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's gotta be ways
in which they go in and out.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
It has been speculated
for a very, very long time

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that there's a hole down
at the bottom of Loch Ness,

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's how Nessy
keeps going up and down,

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is actually through one
of these larger tunnels

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:90%
down into another watery area.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So they're most likely
using those channels, which

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I think have yet to be fully
discovered and explored

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
by undersea scientists,
that's for sure.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.863 align:middle line:90%
>> What about other planets?

00:19:50.863 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Are they living
below the surface?

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Is that a common thing in
all these other places?

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't say that
it's 100% of the time,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
but what we're finding as we
travel around is that the more

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
we look for subterranean species
and subterranean developments,

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:90%
the more we find them.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's turning out to be just
as common, if not more common

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.965 align:middle line:84%
than civilized life
on the surface.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And why do you believe
they're all heading

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:90%
to the inside of these planets.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it a safety thing?

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It's way safer.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
how civilization

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:84%
is at the whim of environment,
so tornadoes, hurricanes,

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
floods, storms, hailstorms,
meteorological events, a meteor

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:84%
hitting the ground, these are
all things that can seriously

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
damage life on the
surface as it's attempting

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
to grow or evolve, and
none of those things

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:84%
will affect a
civilization that's

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:90%
20 miles underneath the surface.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, do they live
more separate realities,

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:84%
or are they kind of
integrated with each other,

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:90%
all these different species?

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, I'd say they have
some different territory.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So with their
shared territories,

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:84%
they have kind of a shared
understanding of what

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.870 align:middle line:90%
the reality is for themselves.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And if it's something
more isolated,

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
then that's their territory,
and how they view their reality.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
There is how they view
their reality there.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And how different is it
living on the surface compared

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:90%
to living underground?

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's pretty phenomenal and
pretty amazing in some ways.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The cities and the development
is, in some places,

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
off the charts compared to what
we have on the surface here.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So they have the technology
to go amongst the stars?

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, there's
spaceports that connect.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, in hollowed
out volcanoes just

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:90%
under the surface.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, the ships can
go down into the ocean and then

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:90%
through the oceanic tunnels.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah-- and there are--
some of these tunnels

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
are almost a half
a mile, mile wide.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So a pretty good a ship could
actually go through them.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> What's preventing them from
coming to see us on a mass

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:90%
event?

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Protocol, for the most part.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Who wrote that protocol?

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Their ancestors, pretty much.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, they're going by
what their ancestors have

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
told them to not
intermingle on the surface.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:90%
I-- how do I say this?

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>> To most of those
who live subterranean,

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and those who live off
world, those of us who live

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
on the surface are often
referred to as the stinky

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
surface dwellers, so we're
not often looked highly upon.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you think
of the massive population

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
on the surface, it's sometimes
as dumb as a bag of hammers.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So you can see,
maybe, how someone

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
might think about that
stinky surface dwellers.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So part of it is
protocol, and another part

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
is why would you want to
go there anyway and get

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:84%
their icky, dirty filth
on you, because you

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:90%
know they're stinky filth--

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially since we're just
putting all that trash on top

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:90%
of the surface wherever we go.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it different, like
the climate zones we have

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:90%
on the surface?

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
We have places that are
polar, we have subtropical,

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.367 align:middle line:84%
do you see any of
that down there?

00:23:14.367 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There's some
temperature variation,

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:84%
there's humidity variation, and
there certainly are cavities

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.648 align:middle line:84%
there are big enough for clouds
to form and rain to fall.

00:23:23.648 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to think about
one of the weirder things

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to experience, being in
an underground cavern

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.403 align:middle line:90%
and it's raining.

00:23:32.403 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything that's
bioluminescent down there that

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
actually gives
light besides this--

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
There are actually quite
a bit of plant life,

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
microorganisms, and minerals
in the rocks that can do that.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So depending on
where you are, you

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
can often walk along
through the subtle glow

00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of bioluminescent phosphorescent
microorganisms, plants,

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:90%
and, again, minerals.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I noticed through a lot of
the biogene hacking online that

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
they have taken the DNA
from jellyfish, that glow,

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and have now placed it into
dogs, and mice, and rats,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and they're glowing now.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't think it's that
far fetched to believe that

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:84%
these beings could
adapt genetically

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:90%
to their environment and--

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and some of them
have been there for so long,

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
who's to say they weren't
genetically engineering

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and terraforming
those internal spaces,

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:84%
or living in spaces that were
engineered or terraformed even

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:90%
before they came along.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So what other types,
besides ones we just mentioned,

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:90%
that you're familiar with.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we definitely know
that we have our own indigenous

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:90%
insectoid species as well.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi have a story about
when some disaster was going

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to befall the surface
world, and these ant people

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.057 align:middle line:84%
came up and took them
down for a while,

00:24:57.057 --> 00:24:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and they lived down there.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, they came back up
when the coast was clear.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, we
absolutely also have

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:90%
an indigenous insectoid species.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
They keep to themselves
for the most part.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But, obviously, every once
in a while they come up

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and interact, but--

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Where are these locations to
get into these, not facilities,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:84%
but these areas that
these insectoids live?

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are entrances
all over the world.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Some of them under the ocean.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of them through
cavern systems.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind, that you
could end up in a cavern walking

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:84%
along and be right in front
of an entrance and be touching

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
solid rock, because to
you, that;s solid rock.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But to someone from the
other side, it's a hologram.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, moving back and
forth through a hologram

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
isn't so difficult if
you know it's a hologram.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't know it's
a hologram, then it's rock,

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going
get through it.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen a lot of craft
and devices like this that are

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:84%
so organic you'll
walk right by it.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
You would never know
that it was what it is.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, people who are
spelunkers could have been

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
in a cavern and stood right next
to an entrance and not known it

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end, unless
you have permission,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.010 align:middle line:84%
or you know how
to open the gate,

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:90%
you're not allowed in there.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as these
insectoids go, these people,

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
they call the Ant People,
now do they have a queen?

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Do they lay eggs?

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Do they have families?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Are they just--
how does that work?

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a hive mentality
from what I understand,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and operate on a
large queen or king.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
There are-- it is possible,
which not many people know

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:84%
this-- it is possible
for an insectoid hive

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to either be run by a supreme
male or a supreme female.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
There isn't necessarily
a universal male/female,

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:84%
king or queen, and
male or female drones.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:84%
That's something that we tend
to see replicated in insect life

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking about
the more evolved species,

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:84%
turns out that they can
actually kind of go either way.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Of all the other
Inner world beings out

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
there, other than the ones
living below the planet,

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
are there any
commonalities that you've

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.430 align:middle line:90%
noticed yourself between them?

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, certainly this this
bigger sense of existence,

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
because most of them have lived
down there for a very, very,

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:84%
very long time, and have had
continuous civilization longer

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:90%
than we've had up here.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Up on the surface,
civilization goes like this.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Underground, it's more
of a steady climb,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
because, again, there's not
these disastrous extinction

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:90%
events that keep occurring.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So they're able to continue over
time for long periods of time.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So they have
recorded history that

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:84%
goes back tens of thousands
or even hundreds of thousands

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.990 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say they're
more conscious than we are,

00:28:04.157 --> 00:28:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and have evolved
more than we have?

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.303 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say
for the most part.

00:28:08.303 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that
that means that they

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:90%
have more potential than we do.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a
consistency in understanding

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
that terrestrial humans
who live on the surface

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
have among the greatest
potential of beings

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that we're aware of, and we've
had a number of advanced beings

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:90%
tell us that.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of the
beings who live underground

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.805 align:middle line:84%
have been evolving
from a continuous line

00:28:34.805 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
for a very, very long
time that doesn't

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:90%
have the same potential.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So their development is higher,
but their potential is not

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:90%
necessarily as high as our own.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So give us 1,000 years and
we can surpass them all.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any time do you
believe in the future that

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
we'll have
interaction with them?

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:29:01.555 align:middle line:84%
I would say that when we finally
cross the chasm of disclosure,

00:29:01.555 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're not--
that's not going

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to be too far away from
interacting with those species

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's
certainly some people

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
who interact with them now,
and have been interacting

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.248 align:middle line:90%
with them for decades.

00:29:12.248 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just been on
a very small scale.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think when we open up the
travel gateways back and forth,

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, that could open up
a lot of opportunities for them

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to communicate and
interact with us.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it's hard
to judge a time.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't like when people
ask me when what time is

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.660 align:middle line:90%
that going to happen?

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But is there a time frame,
because of your experience,

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that you see coming in
the near future, that you

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:90%
could tell the audience.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I normally also don't
like to give timelines.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
My Brigadier General though
has said to me this year,

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that it's perfectly
OK for me to start

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.330 align:middle line:84%
saying that we should expect
a disclosure event the next 6

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.780 align:middle line:90%
to 24 months.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's past 24 months, I'll
be shocked and surprised.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
If it's less than six, I will
also be shocked and surprised,

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:84%
but it seems that the highest
probability is somewhere

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:90%
in that window.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:90%
So soon, I think, very soon.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:07.772 align:middle line:90%
>> That's extremely soon.

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what happens after
that, like what happens 5, 10,

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:84%
good question, because
everything is going to change.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's really
no trying to predict

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:90%
what happens after that.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're so close
to that, that I can taste it

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.945 align:middle line:90%
in the back of my throat.

00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Randy, another
exciting event today with you.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.552 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming on the show.

00:30:26.552 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for having me.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> When we see Pleadian ships,
we see a sphere of light

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because it is-- the
Merkabah moving so fast.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean civilization
was the product

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:90%
of [INAUDIBLE] people.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But the first Atlantis
was not about pyramids.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:90%
It was about the temple within.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:84%
They taught us how to
relate with the world.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Giants where the keepers of
that wisdom, that information.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilians
represented for us

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:90%
the negative and the positive.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.743 align:middle line:84%
And we will explore the Anunnaki
and how this created structure

00:31:07.743 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:90%
for the humans to transcend.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:10%
