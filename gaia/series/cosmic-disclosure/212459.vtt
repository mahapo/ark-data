>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.030 align:middle line:10%
we are with former US
Marine Mike Herrera.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
distinguished service record.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
Today, we discuss covert
breeding programs.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.365 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE HERRERA: Thank you,
Emery, for having me on.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.865 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can you tell us
about these covert breeding

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:90%
programs?

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, first
of all, they exist.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
They exist more specifically
to help this black organization

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
keep people within their
own organization more

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:90%
of a refined person.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.992 align:middle line:10%
So everybody always asks
in these facilities when

00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:10%
they have whistleblowers,
like, who the janitors are,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.908 align:middle line:10%
the cooks, or the
facilities maintenance.

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they
ever come forward?

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason is
because they're also

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.942 align:middle line:84%
part of this breeding
program where they're

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:90%
selected to be in these bases.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:10%
More homegrown
assets, if you will,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:10%
as well as these people who
may not pass the P3 screening,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:10%
or the psionic predisposition
potential project

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:10%
that allows these people
with sonic abilities.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:10%
So then they go into other
methods, such as working

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.438 align:middle line:10%
at the facility.

00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
to have people take

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
care of the necessities of the
upkeep of these installations

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:90%
from inside and out.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these
breeding programs

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
inside the facility, on bases,
or are they just monitored--

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:90%
these individuals?

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: From what
I've been briefed on,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:84%
it's more of these
installations and bases.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:10%
More of the black
team's, not like

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:10%
a conventional military base.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to find that there.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find this
more of these secluded areas

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:90%
where they have 100% oversight.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no other people
meddling into their business,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:10%
Because what they
explained to me

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:10%
is more like a
horse that's getting

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:10%
bred for running, right, the
derby or, whatever it is.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.783 align:middle line:84%
It takes 1,000 horses to
breed this specific horse.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you do the same concept
with these people that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:84%
come from these third
world countries, or even

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:84%
different environments,
you're going

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:84%
to breed selected people to
refine the perfect human,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, with
a higher morale,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
or higher morals, higher
intelligence, higher brawn.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what a
perfect human would be,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
these people would
emulate those qualities.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are they
raising these individuals?

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Or do they come in
already as an adult?

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
You're saying breeding, so
I'm thinking maybe we're

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
talking about actually
breeding humans into whatever

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:90%
they want this person to be.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.767 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's more of a cheaper force.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You're not having to really
go hunt people down, per se,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.540 align:middle line:90%
try to screen them.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
You can do these--
let's say if you have--

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.105 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Definitely
great for control.

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Well, exactly.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.365 align:middle line:84%
And you keep
everything internal,

00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
so you're not going to
have any exposure come out.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The speculation
goes to this, too,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because they have projects where
they need people to do things.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.297 align:middle line:84%
So if you have somebody that's
higher intelligence, higher

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
brawn, which is something that
a perfect soldier would be,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.602 align:middle line:84%
then you could essentially have
these people go on operations

00:02:58.602 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that nobody knows
because they don't have

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:90%
any biometrics in the system.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
Social Security numbers,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to move
freely of whatever they choose.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're not leaving
any kind of data

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
behind that's recorded through
any kind of law enforcement

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
agencies or anything
for the matter.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they aware
of the outside world?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they still
have a little bit

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:90%
of freedom, free will?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Or is it kind of-- it's
under controlled environment,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:90%
and they're programmed this way?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I believe if it's
to a certain extent of what

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:90%
they're being utilized for.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I think if it's
something where they

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.115 align:middle line:84%
don't have a
generalistic purpose,

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:84%
then I believe
that they're going

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to go to the outside
world, and maybe

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:84%
funnel through a means like
an illegal immigrant, per se.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And then get the
proper documentation

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to get a Social Security number
or apply for citizenship.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they kind of
recirculate them into society

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:90%
for a little bit--

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --to see how
they respond and--

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is that part
of the growth program?

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.452 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I mean,
I could suspect

00:03:50.452 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that it would be because I
know a lot of these assets

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
are chipped, and I know that
they probably don't take them

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:90%
out at that point.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably good
to see how they react.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:84%
It also paints a picture of how
these black teams can utilize

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:84%
these people if they
need to have them

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:90%
outside of the population.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they picking like
the mothers and the fathers?

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And is this like an
artificial insemination?

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And is this like
getting an embryo,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:84%
and then putting
it in to a woman?

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't know
the specifics of that.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.187 align:middle line:10%
I do know that there
has been instances

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:10%
where these people are on
these installations that

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:10%
are kept from the
population in order

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:10%
to be a part of this program.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:10%
Which means that they
could be breeding

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:10%
several different people a day,
or even weekly for that matter,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:10%
and having different types
of people they've screened.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.625 align:middle line:84%
Maybe different populations
of the world, and they

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
try to integrate them and
see what they can do even

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:90%
on a conscious level.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Which brings me to
the next question.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Is there some sort of technology
that speeds up the process?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Or is it, they're just growing
like normal people grow yearly?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Now, if I
was to estimate this,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:10%
especially knowing the
kind of technologies

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.828 align:middle line:10%
that these organizations
have, they would probably

00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:10%
have something that would
probably speed the process up

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.122 align:middle line:10%
artificially.

00:05:05.122 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it just
takes too much time

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
to wait nine months,
and all of a sudden,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
have to go through
the stages of that.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.932 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is, too,
these black organizations

00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
have their own scientists,
they have their own people

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:90%
integrated.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:10%
Some of the top minds in the
world work in these programs.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:10%
So they may teach these
offspring, if you will,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:10%
maybe more advanced stuff
than what current education

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:10%
systems in the United
States, or even

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.873 align:middle line:10%
amongst the other
countries would do.

00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
consciousness?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Are they infusing them with it?

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Or is it-- what's
the consciousness

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.903 align:middle line:90%
level of these offspring?

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well,
it's very likely,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.912 align:middle line:84%
because look at the demographic
of what they're working with.

00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
technologies themselves

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:90%
come from extraterrestrials.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:10%
So if you have people
that aren't connected

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:10%
consciously, then what
purpose are they really going

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:10%
to serve for these black teams?

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be a whole lot.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:10%
I mean, at the end
of the day, if they

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:10%
have somebody who they
can also do at a higher

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.603 align:middle line:10%
intelligence, a higher
brawn, higher spirituality,

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:02.562 align:middle line:10%
then essentially they're
going to be integrated

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:10%
with the consciousness to
be at that level in case

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:10%
they have to do something else.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
What my understanding
is that they're probably

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
going to be more of a
multi-role function.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.092 align:middle line:84%
Not just one specific thing,
but if they can just filter them

00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:15.592 align:middle line:84%
into something else, then I
think that that's very likely.

00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
they're integrating

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
any type of extraterrestrial
DNA or genetics?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think
it's possible.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these are the guys that
are shooting down these craft

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.272 align:middle line:10%
and getting these bodies.

00:06:25.272 --> 00:06:26.357 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's very--

00:06:26.357 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:10%
who's to say they
wouldn't have experimented

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:10%
on something like that to try
to make an alien-human hybrid,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:10%
so to speak?

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.602 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it
possible to say, Mike,

00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
that they could maybe make one
of these offspring, raise them,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
mind swipe them, put them back
into the public and just wait

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
for recall--

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:90%
or wait for them to be used?

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it could be possible.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.337 align:middle line:10%
But then again, there
could be some defects

00:06:49.337 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:10%
that they may have
figured out along the way

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.723 align:middle line:10%
that they probably don't prefer,
and they may do it that way.

00:06:54.723 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And where
is this taking place?

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:90%
What facilities and where?

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I know of one that's
south of the border in Mexico

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.555 align:middle line:84%
I know that they participate
in that, specifically.

00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:06.722 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This is an underground
facility, of course?

00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Not in public view,
anything like that.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:90%
No public access.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in their government
knows what's going on.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.728 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What about Dulce?

00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I know for
a fact Dulce probably

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:90%
isn't a part of that.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:10%
From what we've been
told, as far as our team--

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.513 align:middle line:10%
at least with
disclosure project,

00:07:24.513 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:10%
as that was more for the
PLFS, because they can only

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:10%
access that from Los Alamos
or Groom Lake Underground.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are these
participants being bred for?

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Is there like a specific, or
is there just a multi-function?

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think,
to an extent,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.463 align:middle line:90%
it might be multi-function.

00:07:40.463 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And granted, this is
just my take on it.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So if
you have somebody

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:84%
who's more predisposition
because they

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.687 align:middle line:84%
see how they react,
and maybe they

00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
have an elevated level
of consciousness, OK,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
we need this person
over here for P3.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
At least to help with
the ET technologies,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.953 align:middle line:90%
maybe even summoning craft.

00:07:55.953 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:10%
And then you have
somebody who may

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:10%
be physically stronger, more
agile, things like that.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're running
them through like an ASVAB?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Probably.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Something way more
advanced than that, obviously.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How does a
participant's gender role

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.285 align:middle line:90%
play in this?

00:08:09.285 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think it might
be specific to whatever

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:90%
they're going to have them do.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:10%
Let's say if you're a female,
very fertile, for example,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.048 align:middle line:10%
but you have elevated
consciousness

00:08:16.048 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:10%
and you have-- they
have a male, per se,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:10%
that's been probably offspring
of these breeding programs that

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:10%
may be a perfected version, and
then they integrate with that.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Create another person
that actually has both

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:10%
of qualities of both parents.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're keeping
this fine tuned, this--

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --breeding program?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.903 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's like
breeding the race horses,

00:08:35.903 --> 00:08:37.570 align:middle line:84%
so they're going to
try to get the best.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.887 align:middle line:10%
And it may take
several generations,

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:10%
which is why it would
make sense if they're

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:10%
trying to speed this up using
some sort of technologies.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what do you
think their agenda is?

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing all this?

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Just to
be self sufficient,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
that's the only thing I
could really understand.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you have people
working in these installations,

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:10%
or doing these projects, or
even doing the manufacturing,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:10%
or things like that, so if
you're keeping everything

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:10%
underground, and so
monitored, and so controlled,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:10%
you're not going to have any
outside variables to come in

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:10%
and, essentially, worry them.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
You're not having a truck
across the globe trying

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to find the same
type of people when

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
you can just have them homegrown
wherever your installation is.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think there'll
ever be replaced by AI?

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't think
so because AI's not

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
going to necessarily have the
integration with consciousness

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
like a human could,
because there's just

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
so many into-- so much more
variables that play into that.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:10%
Because if that was
really the case,

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:10%
they wouldn't need
these P3 subjects

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:10%
to go summon these craft
and connect with ETs.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.668 align:middle line:84%
They'd just have AI do it,
and they don't do that.

00:09:35.668 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you said they
have circuits in them,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.010 align:middle line:84%
so I'm thinking if there's
a circuit, then that person

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:90%
could be hacked.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I think
it's hacked to be

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.797 align:middle line:10%
utilized by the black team,
not to be controlled by AI.

00:09:45.797 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Because AI-- I mean, there's so
many variables even with that.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You could even hack AI, but
you can't hack a black team

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:90%
member, per se, and have them--

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:84%
it's more controlled,
if you will.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think the
breeding program is connected

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:90%
to the super soldier program?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And what might that
agenda be like?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: It's possible.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It's very possible.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have essentially the
perfect human, perfect response

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:90%
times, reaction times.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.395 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So if you have
that ability and you can--

00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
these people can run faster,
they can move faster,

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
they're more agile, they
may have enhanced vision,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:90%
enhanced senses.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense to
actually have them

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:90%
do some of these operations.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but they can't
leave a biometric trace.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:90%
That's controlled, too.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So they're just--

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:90%
they don't exist.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Exactly.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:90%
So if I was--

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.977 align:middle line:84%
let's say if I was a commander
in these operations, that'd

00:10:33.977 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:90%
be my best asset right there.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows who they are.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:10%
They don't come up
on any kind of camera

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:10%
where they could do facial
recognition software.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.950 align:middle line:10%
They don't have any fingerprints
that people could actually

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.158 align:middle line:10%
recognize through the system.

00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:46.533 align:middle line:84%
And if they have any blood
that they leave behind and try

00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to recoup that DNA, it's not
going to come back anything

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:90%
that they know.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
That'd be the perfect way to
conceal it, even as obvious

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:90%
as it is.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.223 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, while working
with some of the programs--

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
the super soldier programs when
I was in, it wasn't so much

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
about getting the soldier to
be like large and brawn like

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.800 align:middle line:84%
a bodybuilder, it was more
getting the thought process

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and the reaction speed time
up so they can think about--

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.142 align:middle line:90%
and also, the ESP part.

00:11:13.142 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So they can think what you're
going to-- they already

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
know what you're going to do
before you even throw a punch.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And to try to delineate that
and get that out of the way

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:90%
without even having to fight.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.435 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it might be
the same concept with this.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.518 align:middle line:10%
It might be more refined
because you don't have

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:28.190 align:middle line:10%
to worry about any oversight.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:10%
So they may be doing things that
maybe cut corners, or maybe do

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:10%
things in extreme.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.547 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
they're actually

00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
going to be implementing
psionics with these breeders?

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I think
they already are.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Because that would--

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: That would make sense.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:10%
I mean, because
you have somebody

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:10%
at that caliber that also has
a higher consciousness that

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:10%
can do that.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's a hell
of a person right there.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.168 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And those are all
going to be under control?

00:11:48.168 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Or they're just kind of letting
them run as solo agents?

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I mean, if
it's an asset like that, which

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you can't come
across anywhere else,

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.400 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want
to control that.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.733 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to want that
to be leaked out anywhere.

00:11:57.733 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:10%
And then who's to
say how they react?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we
have to assume is

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.135 align:middle line:84%
that these people don't have
any access to the outside world.

00:12:04.135 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:10%
The only outside the world
that they have access to

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.213 align:middle line:10%
is, unfortunately, ETs being--
those getting shot down,

00:12:09.213 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:10%
on top of the fact that carrying
out these missions, which

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:10%
is very probable.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these
people eventually

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.920 align:middle line:84%
assimilated into high
government positions?

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I don't know.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's fair to say
that they possibly could.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:10%
But even then, you're looking at
a lot of variables that happen,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.402 align:middle line:10%
or they may have
to go through with.

00:12:28.402 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:10%
You're having to look
at somebody getting

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:10%
to these positions that have
to be well versed in that

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.645 align:middle line:10%
and trained.

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:33.445 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:35.635 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: So I know they
have people in positions

00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:10%
of government or positions
of in the corporations--

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: A lot of programming.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: It is.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:10%
It is.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.638 align:middle line:10%
So it's likely, but I
don't personally know.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So what about cloning?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Is cloning part
of these projects?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.705 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I believe so.

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:10%
I don't know specifically
what the black team

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:10%
involved with that, but I do
know cloning projects that they

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:10%
utilize for the
program life forms,

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:10%
or what people deem as actual
ETs, when they're really not.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.472 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: So I do
know of programs

00:13:02.472 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:10%
where they utilize a
paramilitary organization,

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:10%
which may be a division
of these black teams

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:10%
that they go and harvest
cattle to get the least

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:10%
volatile materials
out of the cow,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:10%
and then they bring it
back to the installation.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.355 align:middle line:10%
And that's how they kind
of grow these things

00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:10%
with that type of--

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.382 align:middle line:10%
using the materials
to suspend the--

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: The suspension, huh?

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Is it the organs?

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I believe so.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:10%
But if you have something
that doesn't look human,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:10%
and it's something that
looks very otherworldly,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
think it's an ET.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So using a different animal,
like cattle mixed with whatever

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:90%
DNA, that's what you're saying.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's off a little bit?

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So if they ever
are caught or examined,

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:90%
that would be the out.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, brilliant.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.895 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Well,
you're not going

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:10%
to be able to
dissect what it is.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.597 align:middle line:10%
And it's nothing on any
kind of medical journal

00:13:53.597 --> 00:13:56.180 align:middle line:10%
or any kind of medical textbook
that's going to tell you, hey,

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:10%
this is what this life form is.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:10%
They have no clue.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.835 align:middle line:10%
Plus, I mean, look at cattle.

00:14:00.835 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Everywhere.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: They're
in farmlands, they're

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:10%
in areas that are so wide open
that if you're these groups

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:10%
and you have the technologies
to get there instantaneously

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:10%
and harvest this material with
advanced surgical equipment,

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's easy.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Simple.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Simple.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.472 align:middle line:10%
And plus, if somebody
sees something,

00:14:18.472 --> 00:14:20.597 align:middle line:10%
let's say you're using one
of these craft to do it,

00:14:20.597 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:10%
you report it, nobody's
going to take you serious.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So I worked
in the projects, one

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.532 align:middle line:84%
of the interesting things
on the cloning projects

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that I was involved with,
they not only did adults,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
but they were doing
kids and teenagers.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice that
there were also agents

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:90%
that were not just adults?

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No?

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.685 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: No, a lot of these
people were in their 40s--

00:14:40.685 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 40s?

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: --and
been in for a while.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.155 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: So that's at
least the demographic

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:10%
I came across at
least with these guys.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:10%
So I have not seen any
children tied to this.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:10%
One gentleman, more
specifically, he

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.387 align:middle line:10%
was younger than me, and he was
a part of this at some point.

00:14:55.387 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:10%
I just don't know the specifics.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they're
aware of this, the clones?

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I believe so.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: And I don't think
this guy was necessarily

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:10%
a clone.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:10%
I just know he was a byproduct
of this breeding program.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
anything that sticks out

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
from one of these
inbred or cloned people

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that you can see physically that
you would be able to determine,

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.487 align:middle line:84%
hey, man, that's definitely one
of the breeding programs there.

00:15:18.487 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you hyper
intelligence is probably

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the most dead give away,
just because it's abnormal.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You can tell if
somebody's super smart,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.648 align:middle line:84%
and then there's just
like, well, why--

00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So that's
how they stand out

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
would be this highly
intelligent person?

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Are they kind of outgoing?

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Are they kind of reclusive?

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.863 align:middle line:84%
Is there any personality
traits you could discuss?

00:15:42.863 --> 00:15:44.488 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, if
you're intelligent,

00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be outgoing.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You're going to want
to-- you're going to be--

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very confident.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:10%
You're going to be trying
to reinvent everything,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.912 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, if you have
that intelligence level.

00:15:52.912 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:10%
Because intelligent
people don't really--

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.520 align:middle line:10%
they're not really
satisfied with anything

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:10%
because they try to
perfect everything.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:10%
And look at the engineers,
and automobiles,

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:10%
or even scientists
for that matter,

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:10%
they're always revising.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.338 align:middle line:10%
Even the stuff that they
perfect is never perfect enough.

00:16:07.338 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
there's a program that they

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
put into these
individuals so if someone

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
were-- try to, let's
say, hypnotize them,

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:90%
that they wouldn't talk?

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: It's possible.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I--

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The defense
system of sorts?

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.445 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I imagine
that they have something

00:16:23.445 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
that they've integrated
in to make it

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
to where these people
aren't compromised,

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
for obvious reasons.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:10%
Because if that's the
case, and let's just

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.618 align:middle line:10%
say they let a lot of
these people go out,

00:16:31.618 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:10%
and all of a sudden, you have
agents from different agencies,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:10%
or people for that matter,
that don't have any good nature

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.305 align:middle line:10%
in them trying to figure
out what's going on.

00:16:41.305 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of
any of these technologies

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that they implement into
clones that the handlers can

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
actually hear and see
what they hear and see?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: If they're
tracked and chipped

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.445 align:middle line:10%
like what I was told,
then definitely.

00:16:54.445 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:10%
Just because they want to see
the environment they're in.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.195 align:middle line:10%
And not only that,
but I'm pretty

00:16:58.195 --> 00:17:00.935 align:middle line:10%
sure they have ways to recognize
people asking questions

00:17:00.935 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:10%
they probably shouldn't be.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
different levels--

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a hierarchy
of the clones?

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Is there some sort of level?

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Like, this clone is allowed to
do this, and this clone cannot.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I don't know.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know personally.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.733 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It's
possible, but I don't--

00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any actual
first-hand knowledge--

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're just
all mission oriented

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.610 align:middle line:90%
to some extent?

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.165 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Whatever they're
given the task at hand.

00:17:27.165 --> 00:17:30.112 align:middle line:84%
Whatever their benefit
is with that program.

00:17:30.112 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So would we
be able to recognize

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:90%
a person that's been cloned?

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.242 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Ideally
from the outside, no.

00:17:35.242 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not like what you
see in the movie "Sixth Day"

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
where they just look in their
eye and see multiple dots.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Hyper intelligence
is going to be key.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.862 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're going to
look like normal people,

00:17:46.862 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe not even-- not like
normal Americans, I should say.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll stand
out to an extent.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
They'll be more
refined people, but it

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:90%
ain't going to be that obvious.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Have you been debriefed
on what their agendas are?

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Where is this going to go?

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, from the good
guys' perspective of this,

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
they want the transparency from
the government, and as well,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:90%
as the public.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Because one, they'll be able to
actually refine things and put

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.278 align:middle line:84%
them into a safer method of
a controlled environment, as

00:18:14.278 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
opposed to the organization
as it sits right now,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:90%
there's no oversight.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So the agenda, at least
for the good guys,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.182 align:middle line:84%
is to get the complete
oversight of that.

00:18:22.182 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Now as far as the
bad guys, they're

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.265 align:middle line:84%
continuing with the
agenda that they've

00:18:25.265 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
got, which is to be the
most powerful organization.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, have
the capitalization

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
on all the advanced
technologies,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and use it for their purpose,
and being self funded, self

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:90%
reliant, self reliable.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And basically, do everything
integrated within themselves

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.903 align:middle line:84%
and not have to rely
on external sources.

00:18:42.903 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In your
own opinion, what

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
would be a positive
outcome for this program?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, let's
say, best case scenario

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.492 align:middle line:84%
is that the bad people in this
organization are eradicated,

00:18:52.492 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and then all the sudden,
you do have disclosure, then

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:90%
you have oversight of that.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The technologies that the
government does not-- that they

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.057 align:middle line:84%
don't understand what's going
on within this organization,

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:84%
let's just say that gets out
into the government's hands

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and they end up being able to
do very, very beneficial things

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say, even
like fertilization,

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:84%
people who can't have
children, for example.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
That might be
something that helps

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:90%
people who can't have that.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
There may be things
where they can

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.636 align:middle line:84%
do stem cell research to help
regrowing of certain things

00:19:22.636 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:90%
with finer materials.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, there is a lot of
things they could even probably

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
do with the blood
platelets, or anything even

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:90%
advanced with that.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even a consciousness
aspect of it.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.432 align:middle line:84%
So I think medical
science is going

00:19:35.432 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the biggest
things that benefits--

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That
benefits from this.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it benefits everybody.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Look at healthier people.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.493 align:middle line:84%
You're not having to look
onto opioids, per se.

00:19:44.493 --> 00:19:45.910 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they have a
different method

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:10%
they can do using natural
abilities, or even

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:10%
natural materials
to help with this.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
If the black teams
have this aspiration

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to control everything,
are they working

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:84%
with another
extraterrestrial race?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I don't know
if I'd say that they're

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
working with, but obviously
the benefit of them

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
shooting down the craft
and reverse engineering

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
it, and using
whatever application

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
they can, such as
weapons systems,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:90%
very advanced technologies.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you have something
where you took down,

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.995 align:middle line:84%
and essentially in
reverse engineer that,

00:20:16.995 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and make it to where these
people are able to utilize it,

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
then it puts you on the same
playing field as these races.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So you have the same
technology that they do,

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
more refined for a human aspect,
as opposed to just pure ET.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
it would make you

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
organization on the planet

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing that's
going to stop you from that.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
If ETs aren't going to stop
you, which they easily could,

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:90%
they're just choosing not to.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of any
malevolent extraterrestrial

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.970 align:middle line:90%
races?

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I'm personally not.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I have not heard of
anything like that.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's been
people who have claimed that,

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and end up being these
paramilitary organizations

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
or black teams that are
using this technology.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Disinformation
probably?

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They want
to throw people off.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:10%
They want people to think
that ET is the problem,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:10%
when it really isn't.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.955 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:20:58.955 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think
getting people

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
is going to pave

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:84%
an understanding
that, look, where

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.087 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to find
the problems here

00:21:06.087 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:90%
isn't really the problems.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:90%
The problems within ourself.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: We're trying
to figure out who we are.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And until we can figure out
who we are as a human race,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
as people, we're going to have
a harder time understanding who

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
these other people are that
don't live in the solar system,

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
or even in this galaxy,
for that matter.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:10%
So really, it stems
with us and what

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:10%
we learn about ourselves first
before we can learn about them.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:90%
That's just my opinion.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And you are aware
of these black teams going

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.432 align:middle line:90%
into space?

00:21:31.432 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: I have not
personally have been told that,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.572 align:middle line:10%
but if you have that
kind of technology,

00:21:35.572 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:10%
who's to say that you
haven't went out in space

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:10%
and did things?

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.698 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if
we were restricted

00:21:40.698 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:90%
from space, as some say.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well,
there's speculation.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
There's been people who have
claimed that ETs have shot down

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:84%
satellites or rockets
from going into space

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
because of
militaristic purposes,

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to exploration.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:90%
But that's just theory.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
That's not anything
I personally know.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What would
your opinion be on

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
if, let's say, a higher up
politician, like a president,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
came forward and just
said, hey, I was actually

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:90%
part of a breeding program.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
How would that affect society?

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, you have
to look at the track record,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.477 align:middle line:10%
If they're an upstanding
citizen, and they're very--

00:22:14.477 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:10%
they have high morals,
high intelligence,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:10%
things like that, then who's
to say that you wouldn't want

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.017 align:middle line:10%
people like that doing
the-- doing things for you,

00:22:21.017 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:10%
especially running important
parts of the country.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:10%
As long as they have the morals
and intelligence to do so--

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.030 align:middle line:10%
if it's something that's
breeding corruption and hatred

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.315 align:middle line:10%
and greed into it,
then we already

00:22:32.315 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:10%
have enough of
that in our world.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to deal
with that even further.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you have somebody
who came forward, per se,

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and said, oh, yes.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that would
benefit everybody as a whole.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.025 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I'd
vote for that being.

00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah, me too.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that person is
more politically sound.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be more
rational up here, and also,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:90%
within here too.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Nazis did have a
eugenics program way back when.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
How does that correlate to
what we're doing right now?

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, let's talk
about Operation Paperclip.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure all about that.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.087 align:middle line:10%
>>HERRERA: Operation
Paperclip basically

00:23:02.087 --> 00:23:05.893 align:middle line:10%
took all the brightest minds
in the Nazi environment,

00:23:05.893 --> 00:23:08.310 align:middle line:10%
if you will, and brought them
over into the United States.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:10%
But what people
don't also understand

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:10%
is that the black team also
got some of those people

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:10%
for their own purposes as well.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:10%
So the whole side of
eugenics and things

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:10%
like that, I'm sure that's
funneled into this system too.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:10%
So conventional government, or
blue team, has these assets,

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:10%
and now the black team also
has had those assets ever

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:10%
since the turn of the war.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.802 align:middle line:10%
So the question is, did we
really win the war if they--

00:23:31.802 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:10%
we brought them over here to
integrate the same things they

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.348 align:middle line:10%
wanted to do over there?

00:23:35.348 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, they
obviously had some help

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:90%
building these giant craft.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So they mastered
electrogravitic devices.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:84%
They mastered zero
point energy, for sure.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They got that not only
from the extraterrestrials,

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.337 align:middle line:84%
but they had to have
some human help.

00:23:51.337 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Oh, yeah.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
Paperclip was for.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.695 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know of
only what we're told.

00:23:56.695 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's people out
there who may not even

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:84%
want to be publicly
addressed, but are

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
these brilliant scientists
who maybe have came out

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
with technologies that
they have not released,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
but they could be something
that could transform humanity

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
within a span of 5 to 10 years
to go completely different.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe in a positive aspect,
as opposed to the curveball

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.523 align:middle line:84%
we're having to deal
with present day.

00:24:19.523 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of
these clones living longer

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:90%
than the normal human beings?

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.497 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Not personally.

00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:84%
But if they're in an
environment where they're not

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.463 align:middle line:84%
given the same kind of food
that we're given-- obviously,

00:24:30.463 --> 00:24:32.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
things in the food that

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
can shorten your
lifespan, there's

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stuff with
airborne illnesses.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:10%
It just, I think, depends
on the type of environment.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if these environments that
these people, or these clones,

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.683 align:middle line:84%
are in, then they're going to
be given more of the top-notch

00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
stuff, they're going
to be more of the--

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I mean, who's
to say they don't have

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:84%
any kind of synthetic
nutrients they're given them

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that are more beneficial
to them to keep

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:90%
them more top of the line.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
It may help consciously,
too, to an extent.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:10%
You're not polluting
the person with viruses,

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:10%
or foodborne illnesses,
or even stuff that's

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:10%
going to metabolize
different and compromise

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:10%
their immune systems.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.956 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do you think
society would react to--

00:25:11.956 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:84%
religion and politically
to the disclosure

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.693 align:middle line:90%
of a breeding program?

00:25:15.693 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I
think religion aside,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people base
their information based off

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of religion.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like their
senses, so to speak.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think if people are able
to put that aside and understand

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that this
has been going on for longer

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:84%
than what people
understand, well, one,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
if you're able to clone
people or animals, per se,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.890 align:middle line:90%
you're not--

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.848 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think about
the movie "The Sixth Day"

00:25:37.848 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:90%
when they cloned the dog.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would be awesome
because I love my dog to death.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:90%
He's a great dog.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.020 align:middle line:90%
I would take advantage of that.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd have him for as long
as I could possibly do it.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:10%
But at the same
token, I think there's

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.192 align:middle line:10%
going to be some risks
associated with that

00:25:50.192 --> 00:25:51.280 align:middle line:10%
because it's so unknown.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:90%
At least in our world.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Their world, it's a
little bit more refined.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:90%
So I think medical science--

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, so put in this perspective.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you need a liver, but
here's a clone version of you

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
that you accepted for medical
purposes only to harvest

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.423 align:middle line:84%
the organ to keep
yourself alive.

00:26:10.423 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
You're not the clone,
per se, but you're

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:84%
able to harvest
organs from a clone.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
have to probably

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.250 align:middle line:84%
grow the full human, but if
they can clone your organs

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and then give you a new heart,
or give you a new liver,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:90%
or give you--

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's just
say the possibilities

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:90%
of that are endless.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about people
having more chances of success

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
for finding organ
donors, per se, right?

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:84%
You're not having to rely
on being put on a list

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and waiting maybe nine
months for somebody

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.145 align:middle line:84%
with the same liver type as you,
or maybe the same genetic code,

00:26:40.145 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:90%
However they screen that.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.298 align:middle line:84%
But you have something that's
readily available based

00:26:44.298 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:84%
off this technology,
I mean, my implication

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.693 align:middle line:90%
would to say that that's huge.
