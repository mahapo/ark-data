00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we are with Tim,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:10%
who is speaking with
us today from Germany.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in the
covert government in Germany,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes,
anticipates, and suggests

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:10%
various strategies connected
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emery.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you again.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So everyone knows
about the UFO incident

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:90%
in Corona, New Mexico in 1947.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't know is
why is it relevant today.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when we are talking
about the modern age of UFOs,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
we consider that
Corona, and Roswell,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and several or at least one
more incident could have been

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:84%
the turning point to
the disclosure topic.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So what people need to know is
that even though pop culture is

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
talking about
Roswell a lot, this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
is mostly called the
Corona incident in the way

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:90%
the authorities communicate.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened is that
several UFOs or UAPs, whatever,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
crashed into the
New Mexico desert.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have enough evidence to
believe that this intentionally

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
was an incident to have a jump
start for humanity to more

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
openly conduct in an
open context scenario.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not so much a
disinformation campaign?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It was actually there
to help disclosure?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> So what are we talking about?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The incident that happened
was beyond imagination

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
of the human people
at this time.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So it left pretty
much all involved

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
military forces
pretty astonished,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%
and let's be honest, confused.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:84%
A mixture of fear and teaming
up and manning up attitude.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:10%
We have some evidence
that this incident could

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:10%
have been dropped
or at least could

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:10%
have carried the potential
to bring a whole new aspect

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:10%
of reality to Earth.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You suggested something
changed in the agenda

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:90%
or possibly the timeline.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Is that somehow able
to be corrected?

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:90%
If so, how?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So there always has been
attempts to contact humanity

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:90%
in order to move them forward.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's something special
about this New Mexico event.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, the reaction
that people from that time

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:84%
showed was heavily
fear-based in a way.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So there has been a
lot of confusion to it.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was about
2019 when Corona and Roswell,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico became relevant in
a global plan, so to speak,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
a global disclosure plan
because this is happening right

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.385 align:middle line:90%
in front of our eyes right now.

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have
this Nimitz event,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
where those pilots
see the Tic Tac UFO.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is in a way,
something to reenact

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
the Corona or Roswell
accident or incident.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course, is a way to
bring healing to the timeline,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
even though it's a little
absurd for those people who

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
are pretty much assured.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But the stats show that
it seems to be working.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, there are
immersive preparations going on

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
mainstream media

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:90%
is in line about the topic.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:10%
While people are distracted
from what is happening,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:10%
there are archives set online
with thousands and thousands

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:10%
of documents from the Pentagon,
from certain agencies,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:84%
In Germany, the German
NASA has released images

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
where they are talking
about ancient life on Mars.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:10%
And if you realize the
worth of this information,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:10%
there's somebody,
an official person

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:10%
who has yet just
disclosed that there

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:10%
has been ancient life on Mars.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:90%
This is debated publicly.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot going on.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And those people, there are
also preparations going on

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to separate those cohorts of the
population that show trait anx

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
or trait anxiety and those
who are very well informed,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:90%
liked the audience potentially.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
They have a much clearer view,
those who are watching Gaia

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and Cosmic Disclosure
have a much clearer view

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:90%
of what is happening.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are plans all
over the place right now

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and in front of our eyes.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned the Tic Tac
incident being reenacted.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So the planet itself
is heavily protected.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Even those who originally fly
those Tic Tac UFOs, when you

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
communicate with them,
they know that it's

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
forbidden to enter
Earth's airspace right

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
at this very moment
because, of course,

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
it's a very intense time of
global shift going on that we

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:90%
need to happily move forward.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:10%
So what I'm saying is
that the way the UFO

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:10%
acted and showed
itself, this is nothing

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:10%
that has been placed
outside, but more or less

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:10%
a staged event that brings
awareness and the potential

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:10%
to release this documentation,
those information

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:10%
by the Pentagon to
the mainstream media

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:10%
and to everybody
in the whole world.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> If this event is staged,
whose technology is it?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So the original
technology that's been used,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
the Tic Tac UFO, belongs to
another species that's not

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:90%
typically human-like.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It's related to the
original species

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that was participating in the
Corona and Roswell events.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So they're practically
using the same kind

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
of technology, the kind of UFO
to initiate a kind of event.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the way the UFO behaved.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So it just appeared, it waited,
it interacted with the pilots.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
This is clearly showing
that this has been planned.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And in a good way,
in a harmless way,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:90%
a kind of false flag thing.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Like the craft in
1947 that you mentioned,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
these Tic Tac craft are pulling
off a similar event is what

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:90%
you're saying with an agenda.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But who actually is
in charge of that,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and who is operating
those crafts?

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, I'm not
a military guy,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking from
another place of the world.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So there has been some
efforts of the US military

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to collect and to repair a
lot of foreign spacecrafts.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is a kind of lead
that can be accessed by the US

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:90%
military, for example.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
We also know a lot of
whistleblowers and people

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that already have
talked about this topic.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
the UFO behaves.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not privy to the
information who's flying

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:90%
the object, who's doing it.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But the way it
behaves is certainly

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
something that is planned ahead.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking
about or communicating

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
with the original species, they
know that it's not their ship,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and they know it's forbidden
to enter the airspace.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is a heavy
hint that this event

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
is something that gets thrown
into history for two things.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
A, to make it publicly,
and B, to re-enact

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and to hear the timeline
and the mistakes

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
that had been done in
Corona and Roswell in 1947.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you know this?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not that I know from
human side that this event is

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
staged.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But again, the species
that originally

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
is building these
kind of crafts is

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:84%
informed that it's
forbidden to fly them.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:10%
And they would not
choose to fly a UFO just

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:10%
around a aircraft
carrier, and wait there,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:10%
and do some maneuvering.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
unlikely impossible

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:90%
to occur at this point of time.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So who has made the rule that
they can't come here right now?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:10%
And also, people are
seeing UFOs every day.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's a kind of
collective, covert effort

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:90%
to protect the Earth.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:10%
And basically, human
military is so far advanced

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:10%
right now that they easily can
protect the space around Earth

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:10%
perfectly, which
wasn't the case in 1947

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:10%
because those
non-terrestrial beings,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:10%
they could easily come
to Earth and interact

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:10%
with whatever they wanted.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:10%
And also, they didn't know
that this could be something

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:10%
that people wouldn't
want because they

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:10%
were doing this for millennia.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there's military
that sets up those rules.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
second question?

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it a secret military?

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So the covert military has made
efforts to seal the airspace.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have the
potential to do so.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And so non-terrestrial group
would harm the air space

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:90%
or invade the airspace.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But you did mention there
are extraterrestrials here.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.750 align:middle line:90%
How are they allowed to come?

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:84%
You were asking about
the UFO sightings

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:90%
that's happening all the time.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:10%
This is a good question
because about a year

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:10%
ago, when you looked
into the sky in Germany,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:10%
you were seeing
those lights orbs

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:10%
that were traveling at slow
pace from one direction

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:10%
to the other direction.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And one must know that
probably impossible to see

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
a satellite there's
only like a few minutes

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
when the sun is
shining on a satellite,

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and the darkness is
right, so that you

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
can see a satellite because
they're at very high altitude,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're as big
as a very small car.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's not easy
to see something

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that is about the distance
away from, I don't know,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
New York and Washington,
which is as big as a car.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have all those
unidentified aerial phenomena

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
that are moving slowly
from one direction

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to the other direction.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And there were times in
Germany, at least, where

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
you could look up to the
sky, and you could show them,

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and they were slowly moving
from one to the other place.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Those are not
non-terrestrial spacecraft.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:10%
These are things that get
shown, so that the subconscious

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:10%
mind can relate and integrate
them when seeing them.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Because why should
you use a UFO which

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
can easily reach about
40,000 kilometers per hour

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and could move in
every direction,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
but they just let it move slowly
from one point to the other?

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And like one year ago, they
were all over the place.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look
at the sky, there's

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:90%
nothing to be seen right now.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this
changes in a few weeks.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of efforts
to make this subconscious

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
mind of people integrate
the fact that at some time,

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft could fly
over their heads in a way

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:90%
that they don't be scared.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes total sense.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a group that's
for disclosure and of course,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
a group that opposes it.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:90%
So who are these two factions?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Like who are they, number one?

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And what is their agendas?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So I wouldn't say that
it's that black and white,

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:10%
although the result
is pretty binary.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
At least one way when we're
talking about agendas,

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:84%
we have all sorts of
agendas all over the place,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:90%
in every country.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And within every country, we
have sub-agendas everywhere.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has
something on their mind.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
We have come to a point where
the majority of all groups

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
confirmed that it's
best for everyone

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
to come to a point
of disclosure.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Then we, of course, have
some exopolitical interests

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and attempts to sort of
move this overall plan

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:90%
into some kind of way.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So there are lots and lots
of agendas going on right now

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You did say all these groups.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell me
who the groups are?

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:10%
So every country that has
a covert military group,

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:10%
every country that has subgroups
that are already dealing

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:10%
or cooperations that
are already dealing

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:10%
with the intergalactic topic.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of interest
groups of the richest

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
families on this planet.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So everyone who has an
interest in this topic

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and has the ability to be
invited into a committee,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and there have been
meetings in Germany,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and Belgium, Australia,
everywhere around the planet.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:90%
So people could come together.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to make
this disclosure happening.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> This advance force
you mentioned today,

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
how far in years are
they ahead of us?

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I certainly was
surprised to find out how far

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:90%
advanced those groups are.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about the early 2000s,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:84%
already technology that
is beyond imagination

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:84%
for almost everyone
that didn't come

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:90%
into any information about this.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
medical technology.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about space
travel, which is possible

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
because we can generate magnetic
fields around things to make

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
them levitate and use
some fields to shoot them

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:90%
into the sky.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
probably everything

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine and even
more right now at the moment

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because we're also pretty good
at manipulating timelines.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Time travel.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Lots and lots of things
that are beyond description.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are they not sharing
these advancements with

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
humanity?

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've come to a place
and time where we know that

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:84%
if we don't share
this information,

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:84%
then it could go
in a bad direction.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that if
we share more of this, then

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:84%
it's for the mutual
benefit of everyone.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question, I once

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
was talking with a
co-worker of mine.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking him
probably the same question.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that
it needs three days,

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:84%
three days to clean everything
on Earth and every structure.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Clean all the oceans
and get everything set.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:90%
It takes three days.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And he told me then that the
longer those groups wait,

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
the more the technology gain
is worth if this makes sense.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes absolute sense.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you consider yourself part
of that breakaway society that's

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%
in the know?

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an interesting
question, Emery.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I would say that I was privy
to some experiences that

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:90%
enhanced my world view.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful for that.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I also made some
traumatic experiences.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I'm experiencing
the world and Earth just

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
in the same way as everyone
else on the surface experience

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:90%
this world.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:10%
So I hope that I can
be a productive member

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:10%
to bring those two
worlds together.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you contribute to the
decision making that will

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:90%
affect us all?

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm not in the first
line to make any decisions.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So what I was doing is
collecting data, learning,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:90%
studying, and giving advice.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And once this advice
is out, then people

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
within this committee decide
what's going to be rolled out.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, it's
my approach to A,

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
help transcends into a way or
into a direction of designated

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.450 align:middle line:84%
peace, and B, to gain
some trust and to help

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:90%
correct those timelines.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And where do you and your
people stand on disclosure

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and contact?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm not
doing this officially.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I myself wanted disclosure
for at least 10 years.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been told that
it is not possible.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And I do see the opportunity
and necessity to make baby steps

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and still move on very
rapidly into this direction.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> How you imagine
humanity will respond?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I hope that humanity
sees all the benefits to it

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:84%
because disclosure is something
that can positively affect

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:90%
the whole species.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
and I myself, I'm

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
regaining trust in the
process, especially

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:90%
with the people in charge.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm hoping is
that more and more people

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:84%
via this episode,
for example, begin

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to realize what
reality we're living in

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and maybe feel open-minded
and open-hearted

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
about the opportunity to get
in contact with best practices

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
with families, with other
species, and opportunities.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:90%
This is what I hope for.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee that there are
immersive plans and preparation

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to guide everyone through
this process the best we can.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, in what way?

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So for example, a lot
of things we have already

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:90%
discussed.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:84%
We can see those UAPs
in the sky, which

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is good for our unconsciousness
to realize what's happening,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:84%
so we don't freak out
when we see something.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
We have more and more
people coming forward

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
from special projects or
clandestine involvement

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and covert programs.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
This is to have those
people who are already

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
ready for this integrate
even more information.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
We will see that the
economy of the world

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is changing because
it's been driven down.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:10%
And so once there are
new job opportunities,

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.600 align:middle line:10%
there are new trade
opportunities,

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:10%
new currency systems will
be set up on this planet.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot of
opportunities to this.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And also, people that experience
isolation within this time

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
frame we're in, they
can prepare themselves

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
for more and more open travel
and more and more experience

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to go out off world.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So in a way the
isolation that we all

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
experience right at
the moment, I'm also

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
experiencing this right
now here in Germany,

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
this prepares people to be more
open for off world realities

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
because there's not too much
happening on this planet

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
right now in terms of
opportunities to travel,

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.120 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We have never seen such
extreme changes going on around

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Does it have anything
to do with open contact?

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> To my understanding, yes.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that open
contact is the only thing

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:84%
that we need to prepare
for because reality itself

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:90%
is shifting.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's potentially
a lot more going on.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But what we can see
is, for example,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're openly discussing
world currencies at the moment.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that people should

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
try to get the focus
on what is empirically

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:90%
happening right now.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And I can suggest that
we're more and more heading

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.560 align:middle line:90%
towards world currencies.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:10%
And this leads to a
changed economic system.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And overall, the
economy that we had

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:84%
was more something
that keeps people

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
busy in some kind
of way, in order

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:90%
not to go down the rabbit hole.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:90%
This is my understanding to it.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:10%
And I think this hasn't
done anything good

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:10%
concerning the overall
potential of humanity.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:84%
We can do much, much, much
more and much better things.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What about human freedoms
and the restrictions we're all

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:90%
going through?

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
How does that
affect open contact?

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I myself was suggesting that
a quarantine phase would be

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
something that would be
beneficial for the planet

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:90%
or for the disclosure plan.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But then I feel
that it's something

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
that is typical to human minds
to be sort of overprotective

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and to keep the
narrative as strongly

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:90%
in their hands as possible.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not a decision maker.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I can only suggest things.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I personally would
suggest that it's better

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
for the natural process,
to just give in to it,

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
to be as transparent
as possible,

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.410 align:middle line:90%
and to be honest with people.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But then again, we certainly
all know that humans, especially

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
decision makers, are
very strictly trying

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:90%
to keep things in their hands.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.012 align:middle line:90%
It's a pity.

00:25:21.012 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you think your
colleagues will respond with

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
everything you're
sharing today on Gaia?

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the preparation
of this episode,

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I was communicating with
Gaia via video call.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And I myself, I have to
feel my way through it.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:90%
This is new to me too.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's been brought
to my attention

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that after the
first call of Gaia,

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:84%
there has been some discussion,
like who's this guy,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and who made him do this?

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:84%
But the way that I can sit
here and have this conversation

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:84%
with you that shows me that I
have the opportunity to gain

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:90%
trust in doing so.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.925 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping I'm
doing a good service.

00:26:16.925 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I believe you are.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Over the next five
to 10 years, where

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:84%
do you see humanity going
to meet our galactic family?

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> This is mostly the biggest
revelation in human history

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:90%
that we've seen for millennia.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are
millions and millions

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of families and friends outside
of our own solar system that

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:90%
are celebrating this with us.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a way to enhance the
opportunities and possibilities

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:84%
of the universe for healing,
for exchange programs,

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
for finding and observing best
practices within the universe,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to learn from them,
and to apply them,

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and to also have
wondrous science

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:90%
in this versatile universe.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Make this a happy shift.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed, we will.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again, Tim.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for the
opportunity to speak.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:90%
