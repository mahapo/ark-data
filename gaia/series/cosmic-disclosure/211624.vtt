>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy Cramer, who
has participated in a covert

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:10%
military space program for 18
years called the Earth Defense

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:10%
Force.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking about
the Galactic Federation.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.317 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY CRAMER:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Former Israeli Space
Security Chief Haim Eshed said

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have been in contact
with extraterrestrials from

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:90%
a Galactic Federation.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.995 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean by this?

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Yeah, I think he
got in trouble for that.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
supposed to say that,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and he's been
quieted down probably

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit since then.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, there
are the federation

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
of worlds or
organization of worlds

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:84%
that come together
or come together

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
in a Galactic Senate,
a deliberating body

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of policy-voting members.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So we often refer to them
as the Galactic Senate,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
as that is where all the power,
and vote, and information comes

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.063 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So that's what they
go by, not really Galactic

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Federation like pop
culture we talk about.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the Galactic Senate.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Internally, we
refer to it more that way.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But again, terminology
like this depending

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
on what Department you're
in, whether you're military

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're
in the diplomat core

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're in
a corporate division.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.347 align:middle line:84%
Some of these words become very
interchangeable to some people.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And who are the
members of this Galactic

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Senate?

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it organizations
or extraterrestrials?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Are they interacting with us?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Every civilized world
in the galaxy that has been

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
invited to be a member and has
accepted that membership is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:90%
a member.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone gets an invitation.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: How do you get that?

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Yeah, you have to be
a spacefaring civilized world

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that's willing to comply
with the treaties,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
which we are in the process at
the moment of becoming a fully

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
spacefaring trading civilization
who is complying with those

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.233 align:middle line:90%
treaties.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When do you believe
that will be public for just

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:90%
the regular civilians here?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.505 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Soon.

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we always hope
it's going to be soon.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that the tracking
of what's happening,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
we're still looking at some
inevitabilities that will

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:90%
be happening sooner than later.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's another conversation.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're
more like months away,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe a few years
at the most, but I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:90%
think that that's a stretch.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what determines
their boundaries of limitations

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:90%
and interference with us?

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Mostly votes
in the Senate in the body

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Senate where
if, for instance,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
we're having a transition period
and someone wants to say, well,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
should have an invasion.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a bad
idea for everybody.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
policy conversation.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
There's a deliberation.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:90%
There's a vote.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And then whoever decides,
whoever wants to vote,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.943 align:middle line:84%
that we should be able to have
our own invasion can vote we

00:03:10.943 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
have our own invasion, and
those who say no, I don't think

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.318 align:middle line:84%
they should be able to
have their own invasion,

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
will vote no.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.532 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, who is the head
of this Senate then, Randy?

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Oh, there's
not a head of the Senate.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.045 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is a body
of hundreds of thousands

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
of civilized worlds that
make up the entire--

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.378 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So that
is the structure?

00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Yeah, it is
a deliberating body,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
which members can propose
conversations policy

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
conversations the equivalent
of proposing a bill to be put

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:90%
into law or in some--

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their structure isn't
exactly the same as our own.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not exactly
one-to-one there,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's similar enough that
deliberation, discussion

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
of change of law, or
enactment of law or policy,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and the more votes you
get, the more likely

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
it is you're going to
get a yes to that thing

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.092 align:middle line:84%
or versus if you get
too many no votes

00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and then it's not
going to be that thing.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So why are they
interacting with Earth?

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why Earth?

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how long has
this been going on?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: A long time.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thousands of years,
as near as we can tell.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We have certainly
been watched over

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and kept an eye on by
these various civilizations

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and species for at least
thousands or hundreds

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of years.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So, you know again, I think it
has a lot to do with the fact

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that we're a library planet,
housing of information

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
from many, many other planets
in this part of the galaxy.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
because we're an up

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and coming psionically
emergent civilization, that

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
means someone's going to
come along and start having

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
conversations about,
hey, don't you

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
want to come join the big
club and be in the big senate

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and get out of
student government

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
and do the real thing?

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And bring us into
that conversation

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and bring us into the
operational procedures

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.498 align:middle line:90%
of the Galactic Senate.

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have they been part
of the seeding of humanity here

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, or did they
just show up recently?

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: You know the Senate
is an organization that has not

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
been around long
enough, I think,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
to be a seeding organization.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The current Galactic
Senate, as I understand it,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:84%
has only been in operation for
about the last 50,000 years

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:90%
or less.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So there are Galactic
historical upheavals,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding is the
last sort of Galactic reset

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that we had socially,
politically governmentally

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.918 align:middle line:90%
was about 50,000 years ago.

00:05:44.918 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's talk about
the members of this Galactic

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Senate.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Again, every civilized
world that's been given

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:90%
and accepted an invitation.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So, over 200,000
civilized worlds

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
participate and have a chair
or a seat representation

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:90%
in the Galactic Senate.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who's at the
top of that structure?

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: I don't know
that there's a top of that

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.055 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty evened out.

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It's like
a group collective.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Yeah, it's
very collective.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly
more senior members

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
who've been there
longer probably

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:90%
have a little more clout.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But my interaction
with them is it

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:84%
seems less like there's not
someone in charge so much

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
as a large deliberative
body in which it

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
has its hands in many,
many, many thousands

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of other cookie jars
that it is attempting

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to manage and maintain
and conduct interviews,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
investigations, convey
information up and down

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the chain in order
for the Galaxy

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:90%
to run as smoothly as possible.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's saying
something, considering

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
how not smoothly and
smoothly it seems to run

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:90%
given those circumstances.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How long do these
Galactic senators if you would

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%
stay in service for that?

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Is it different because
of different timelines

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:90%
for aging species?

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Sure, I mean, the
species' age would certainly

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to do with how long
they might be deliberating

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:90%
in the Senate.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But and it also depends on
the world that they come from.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- some worlds
would have the same idea

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that we do that you
don't necessarily

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
have the same job forever
and for your entire life.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But we also have people in this
world that have the same job

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.397 align:middle line:84%
and do the same career
their entire life.

00:07:41.397 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So are they born into
it, or are they voted into it?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: It depends on the
world you're talking about.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.282 align:middle line:84%
It would be different depending
on the social structure

00:07:48.282 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of the planet that
they come from.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So, but they're certainly
elected or appointed

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
depending on the world
that they come from,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're allowed to
be there for as long

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:84%
as either the people
who send them there

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
find them suitable to be
there or their appointees

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
or their pointers--
sorry appointers

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:90%
find them suitable to be there.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's a flexible
job like anything else.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
people who've been

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
in it for centuries and
longer and other people who

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%
are new at it.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, what determines
their boundaries of limitations

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:90%
and interference here?

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Yeah, again, that
really mostly has to do with

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:90%
policy voting.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So, I'll see if I can be
more specific about that.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
So you have some sort of larger
groupings of species that

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
cluster around kind of, let's
call it intention and belief

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
so that you have the busybodies,
nosy busybodies which think

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that they should be involved
in everybody's business

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with everybody's
business and fixing

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
everybody's, every world's
problems and getting involved

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
in every civilzation's--and
so forth.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:90%
So you have the busybodies.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
You also have the NIMBYs,
the Not In My Back Yards.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
They're like, well,
as long as this

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
isn't happening in my
area, then I'm OK with it.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
You also have the let's not do
anything and let it sort itself

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
out types who are like,
well, let's not get involved,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and let's let them
sort itself out.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's let evolution
take its own course.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
You have clusters of ways
in which members vote.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on
what the policy question

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
is, how many busybodies think
that they should be involved,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.898 align:middle line:84%
how many of the
not in my backyards

00:09:36.898 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
don't want to have anything
to do with it if it's

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.952 align:middle line:84%
too close to them, how many of
let the path of evolutionary

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
whatever take its
course, depending

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
on how many people
you can convince

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to vote one way or another will
depend on how those votes go.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But I will just say the
cloister of let's just

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:84%
let it work itself out
is a lot of people,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of votes
that are often just like,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:84%
er, let's just let
it sort itself out.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're often arguing
with the busybodies,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:90%
well, no, we got to do this.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And, er, let's let
it sort itself out.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:90%
No, let's really get in there.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:90%
No, let's not.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So depending on how the
brakes are will depend on

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
whether a policy vote
goes one way or the other

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
based on the cloistering of
ideas of how much interference

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
really do you want to
have or should you have.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Different opinions about that.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You said us joining
the Galactic Senate will be

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:90%
happening soon.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, it's an
inevitability like so many

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:90%
other things.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
We are in a position where
we are we're very smart.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:90%
We're very clever.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty fierce, and
we make really good stuff.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So, as we find our place in
the intergalactic community,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not without some position
of authority and responsibility

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
because we're really good
at the things that we do.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Being really good at
the things that we do,

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
we want to be as involved in
those processes as possible.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have as many people as
we can involving themselves

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
in the trade negotiation
with the trade

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
federation or the
trade consortium

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.977 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they want to
call themselves these days.

00:11:21.977 --> 00:11:23.920 align:middle line:84%
We've got people who
are well involved

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
in politics at the
Galactic Senate level

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:84%
because they want to make
sure that when we have

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.332 align:middle line:84%
representation, we understand
how the freaking system works,

00:11:32.332 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:84%
so we know what
we're doing, and we

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
know how to get things
done, how to make things

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:90%
happen here and elsewhere.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:84%
We have one of the strongest,
most powerful militaries

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:90%
in this corner of the galaxy.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
That's, again, no small feat
that we have achieved that

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
in such a tiny, tiny amount
of time, less than a century.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:84%
In less than a century, we have
gone from slingshot flicking

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
monkeys to the
intergalactic community

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to a absolutely respectable
military in which people know

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
to not poke us in
the eye, and maybe

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
if they need help that,
we should be the ones

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:84%
they call first because
we're incredibly capable.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's happened in a
very short amount of time.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So everybody wants
to get involved.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to participate
so that we have the greatest

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
advantage and position possible
to do the best that we can

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and control the space
in which we live,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and that includes our own
solar system and nearby

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
so that we can police,
navigate, and peaceably control

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:84%
for commerce more space as
possible because the more

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that we can control
for commerce,

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the more prosperous and
peaceful our planet will be.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are there any species
in the Galactic Senate that

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:84%
oppose the Earth going this far
joining up with the Galactic

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Senate?

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Oh, sure.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And why is
that, and who are they?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Sure.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're kind of the
senior citizens of the crowd.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
They're like old people
that are just like you're

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
too young, you whippersnapper.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:90%
You're not ready yet.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Just that kind of crap.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's
just people who have

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:84%
been around a little
bit longer and forgot

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
what it was like maybe
to be new and forgot

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
what it was like to be starting
up again and/or just kind

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.247 align:middle line:90%
of like you're not ready.

00:13:29.247 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could it ever be a
possibility that that group

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
would get together
and, like I'll say,

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.407 align:middle line:84%
vote against us joining
the Galactic Senate?

00:13:36.407 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: There's not enough of
them to swing that many votes,

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're a pretty
small block of votes.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you remember
what species they came from?

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.423 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: I mean, well,
we're talking again.

00:13:47.423 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
consortiums of species,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:84%
over 200,000 species
we're talking

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:90%
about voting blocks of--

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.320 align:middle line:84%
consortiums of voting blocs
that agree or see things

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:84%
a similar way, which is why they
end up being voting blocs that

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:90%
vote the same way on things.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In pop culture, they
do talk about the same dozen.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
How is that in
reference to this?

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, I mean because
way back in the early days

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
in the '40s and '50s, we were
initially contacted by a tiny

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
handful that became a slightly
larger handful that for several

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.170 align:middle line:84%
decades was who we were dealing
with was a dozen different

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say that most people
have not moved beyond that.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say that
the community at large

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
hasn't moved beyond that when
those numbers of other species

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:84%
have grown exponentially
over the last few decades,

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and we're dealing with a
lot more, but you know.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who actually now
is dealing with humanity now,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and who determines
that, and who are they?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: The diplomatic core
of the Galactic Senate would be

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%
responsible for that.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:90%
They would be the--

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What's
a diplomatic core?

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.487 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: The diplomatic
core would be those who are

00:15:02.487 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
diplomacy, ambassadors,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%
and all of their personnel.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:84%
When you need to
talk about things,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
you have diplomats
talk to diplomats.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Once something's been ironed out
and you have an agreement, then

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
corporations or
companies or businesses,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
business to business
can start talking,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and they can start trading.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:29.180 align:middle line:84%
If there's military involvement,
then diplomatic cores

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:84%
can talk to military personnel
then military personnel

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:90%
can be involved.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But your diplomatic cores
are your first contact

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
of communication
between any world.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to talk through
an ambassadorial team

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.020 align:middle line:84%
through another
ambassadorial team, people

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
who are specialized in
training and experience

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
at how to be really cordial
and polite with everyone

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's why they do that.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why that's their
job because they're

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.883 align:middle line:90%
really good at that.

00:16:00.883 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So, all those
initial conversations

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:84%
will be started with
the diplomatic core.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned there's
200,000 members in the Galactic

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Senate.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:84%
That would be so
overwhelming for us.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So, who are we directly
in contact with for that?

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Right, well, again,
we started the initial contact

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
with a limited
number of species.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We were talking to
the Zetas we were

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
talking to members of the
Agarthan network, members

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:90%
of the Andromedans.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So we had these early
contacts with folks who

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:90%
were the initial contact point.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we have
been introduced just

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to more and more and
more and more over time.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So now our own registry of
species worlds that we're

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:90%
contacting is well over 1,000.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're in the we're
in the thousands, I think,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.138 align:middle line:84%
So it's been growing
drastically every year.

00:16:51.138 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, how do
other beings like the Greys

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and the Reptilians carry out
their agendas here on Earth?

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Do they have to face first
the Galactic Federation?

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: No, mostly
it's because we're out

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:90%
in the boonies.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:05.720 align:middle line:90%
We're in the sticks.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it's whatever you can
get away with until you can't.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And people have been able to get
away with whatever here until

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.865 align:middle line:84%
we established military presence
so that they cannot just do

00:17:17.865 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:90%
whatever they wanted to do.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:84%
So that's taken
some time, but we're

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
doing way better there
than we've ever been.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, are there other
species like us similar to us

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:84%
that are even farther out than
these boondocks that we're in?

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.327 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it gets even--

00:17:31.327 --> 00:17:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they more
advanced or less advanced?

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Most of what happens
as you go out towards the rim

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is it gets less advanced as
you go towards the rim and more

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.890 align:middle line:84%
advanced as you go
to Galactic Central.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Tendency.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
there aren't more advanced

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:84%
or some more advanced
species out there.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.772 align:middle line:84%
It just tends to be a
very, very tiny number.

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is
Galactic Central?

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Where is that located?

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: If you
look at the, well,

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking about
the Milky Way galaxy,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
you look at a picture, a
map of the Milky Way galaxy,

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's this cluster of
stars in the middle that makes

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
this big ball of what
looks like white,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
just a big white ball
of clusters of stars.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
Galactic Central

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that's or Downtown as
we call it sometimes.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who has the final say
in terms of programs that are

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:90%
being enacted on planet Earth?

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Is it the humans?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.505 align:middle line:90%
Is it the extraterrestrials?

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: That's
a good question.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I would say that there's
a conversation that

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:90%
has to take place.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
There's not much
that we're going

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to allow to happen here
that we don't have a say in,

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and there's not much
that we're going

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to do right now
that we're not going

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
to want to hear what the
say of the Galactic Senate

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
is because we want
to be in compliance.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:90%
We want that seat.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
We want everything to
go very, very well,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
so we would like to be
in compliance with that.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But we're also not
letting someone else

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:90%
decide our fate for us.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So these are conversations in
which both parties or multiple

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
parties are going to have to
sit down, talk it out, work it

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
out, and come to a mutually
acceptable conclusion

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
or understanding of
what's going to happen.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, what limits us
to what we can say in our own

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:90%
sovereignty?

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Less and
less every day,

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:84%
the more military
power that we have,

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
the more our own ability to
decide what we want to do

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and our own sovereignty on
any given day on our ability

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to choose our own destiny
is more and more prevalent.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Every day, we get
closer and closer

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to being more and more
self-determined, more and more

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
self-sovereign as a species.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's going to be
some interaction for quite

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:90%
some time.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And being a good member of
the intergalactic community

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
is not just about doing what
we want to do on our own time

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:90%
and making our own decisions.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
It is also about being
responsible to the law

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and order of the universe at
large and the galaxy at large.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, access to
exploration in space for people

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, will that be
more of an experience that we

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
can do, or is that something
that it'll be under more

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
control of advanced
extraterrestrial civilizations?

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: My understanding
is that when we get past

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:84%
our actual disclosure moment,
there's supposed to be a end

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to the trade embargo, an
end to the travel embargo,

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and an end to the
information embargo.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So, hopefully, that means
more information, more trade,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and more free travel.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So those are the
things that will help us go

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:90%
amongst the stars?

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Absolutely.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, we
got a lot of people

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.352 align:middle line:84%
here that want to
conduct a lot of business

00:20:47.352 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and sell a lot of stuff, sell
their paintings somewhere else,

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
sell their sculptures
somewhere else,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
sell their albums
somewhere else,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and sell their
beer somewhere else

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
customers out there

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:90%
that want to buy that stuff.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How does this in
relation to some of the very

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
conscious 5D beings?

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:90%
How do they fit into this?

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, they have the
luxury of being able to have

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that opinion if they want to
have it because they don't have

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to worry about food, or water,
or shelter, or security,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
or safety, or any
of those things.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
the luxury of not having

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to worry about any
of those concerns,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:84%
then you can have
super highfalutin ideas

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
about how we should
live or exist

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
as long as it is the case that
we are cellular beings that

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
require water, food,
shelter, and so forth.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.152 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we want to talk about
Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:21:44.152 --> 00:21:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a whole
bunch of things that we need,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:84%
from physical material
to social, emotional,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
psychological
fulfillment, in order

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:90%
to be decent human beings.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
be a matter of, hey,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:90%
we're going to come--

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.382 align:middle line:84%
forget those guys trying
to trade stuff with you.

00:22:01.382 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come over
here and just show you

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.850 align:middle line:84%
how to evolve
psionically so that you

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:90%
don't have to do that anymore.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:90%
That's not a finger snap.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That's not a process
that's going to happen

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.710 align:middle line:90%
in months or years even.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a process that
could take minimum decades

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:90%
or centuries.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, us going into
space and traveling around

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and gaining that experience,
we'll learn these things?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Eventually,
yeah, over time.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
process for that.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
There is a growth
process for that.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we have
billions of people

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that require food, water,
shelter, and sustenance,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
the main reason that
our civilization exists

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:84%
is going to be to trade
goods and services.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So that everyone
can be sustained.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We are still biological mammals
that can starve to death,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:84%
dehydrate to death, freeze
to death, overheat to death,

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
or any other number
of things to death,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:84%
which mean we require
food, water, shelter,

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.323 align:middle line:84%
and other things to get
out of survival states.

00:23:04.323 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we're
in survival states,

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:84%
we're never going
to evolve to that.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So we have to fix
the civilization

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're in so that we're
not panicking and wanting

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:84%
for food, water, and
shelter, then we can evolve.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But until we get
past this stuff,

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to be able to
do any of that evolution stuff,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
not as a society, not
as a civilization.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:84%
As individuals,
yes, we can always

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
be doing this as individuals,
but as a society,

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
more than that.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do we need to do
for Earth to have more access

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to advanced civilizations
here in space?

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: You know, I think
it would help us tremendously

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.070 align:middle line:84%
as Terrans if we could behave
less like chimpanzees throwing

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:90%
poop at each other.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:84%
If we can separate ourselves
from some of our lower

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
primal primate
behavior, which is

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what is our undoing,
I think, at the moment, then

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:84%
we have a greater
chance of that.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like a teenager
asking their parents when

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
do they to get the
keys to the car,

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and the answer is when
you're responsible enough,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and you behave like I can trust
you with the keys to the car

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and not like you're
going to go running down

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
the road throwing poop at
people outside the car window.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did they ever
talk about a percentage?

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:10%
Does the entire planet have
to be conscious and not

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.345 align:middle line:10%
push the red button at each
other for that to happen?

00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Did they ever mention
like, well, maybe

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:84%
if the half of the planet's
this conscious or 2/3,

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.363 align:middle line:90%
maybe we can--

00:24:37.363 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Critical mass is
what we're talking about,

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
but and we don't have
a number on that.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
We have continued to try
and solve for that number,

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
like what is the number
of critical mass.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:90%
What's the number?

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it 100%?

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
No, it doesn't have
to be 100%, but it has

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:90%
to be more than what it is now.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere between where
we are and under 100,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and we got to be working towards
that so that we can earn it

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
a little bit and be
trusted to be responsible

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
people and like we're not
going to just go wreck the car.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Will they
allow humanity to do that

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
on their own natural lifespan,
or would they ever interfere

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and speed that up with
maybe a cataclysmic event?

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Yeah, I mean, I think
we're well on our way towards

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:90%
that being sped up.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, I've been
hearing some interesting things

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:90%
recently.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we feel that
everything that we're hearing

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:84%
is still directing
us that an invasion

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:84%
scenario is more likely
still than anything else.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As our mentor, would
the Galactic Senate allow this

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.605 align:middle line:90%
to happen?

00:25:48.605 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: That's
a good question.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have had
many conversations

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
with many different
Terrans and non-Terrans

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:90%
about this very subject.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And again, there seems to be
some differences of opinion

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, it
depends on who you ask.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
answer we get.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Looks like though
in history, wouldn't you say,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.345 align:middle line:84%
Randy, that they have been
interacting and pulling

00:26:08.345 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
the reins back on us, especially
with anything to do with

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:84%
nuclear radiation, including the
power plants and the warheads?

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>> RANDY: Yeah, some, for sure.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've certainly
seen quite a bit of that,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
but we have not
seen 100% of that.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:90%
We have seen testing.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
We have seen live
warhead activity.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
We have seen the use of
tactical nuclear warheads

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:90%
over the last 20 years.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't talk about it.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't-- it's not
very publicly talked about,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.700 align:middle line:84%
but tactical nukes were
used in Iraq 10 years ago.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Where's the dividing
line between,

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
we'll help up to this point,
but not up to this point,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:84%
or we won't interfere
up to this point

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and then but we would
interfere after that point.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Big question.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And do I know the answer?

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.900 align:middle line:84%
No, because I've talked to
20 different Terrans and 20

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
different non-Terrans, and
depending on who I've talked to

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
has depended on
what answer I get.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.865 align:middle line:84%
And so because the
answers are inconsistent,

00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
real answer to that is.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
the real lines are.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
would like to think, no,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:84%
they won't let us all
die, OK, but what's all?

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.422 align:middle line:84%
No, they're going to
preserve the civilization.

00:27:22.422 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's that mean?

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Preserve what?

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think when you get
into the details of what

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.700 align:middle line:84%
do these things really mean,
who's going to get protected?

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Who's a flower, and who's
a weed in this metaphor?

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, who's a rutabaga
and who's a thistle?

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's the
comparison here?

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And who's judging that and
how do you decide that,

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and by what criteria and what's
enough and what's too much?

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Randy,
on a positive note,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
what could you share with
our viewers about elevating

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness
so at that time,

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it's not if we're a good
flower or a bad weed?

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: I think psionic
development and psionic

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:84%
self-mastery and
learning, mental skills,

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and mental self-mastery is
probably the most important

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:84%
thing that anybody can still
learn to do at this point

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:84%
for their own well-being when it
comes to communication contact

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and not being eaten.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Absolutely, I think
awareness is very important

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.782 align:middle line:90%
for that kind of contact.

00:28:22.782 --> 00:28:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY: Well, this is why my
partner Kendra and I started

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.480 align:middle line:84%
the University of Conscious
Evolution to teach psionic

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
principles, meditation,
psionic self-mastery,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and development so that people
can learn the basic tools

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and skills of psionic
communication,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.312 align:middle line:84%
psionic self-mastery,
and development.

00:28:40.312 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, Randy,
thank you so much.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.212 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting, as always.
