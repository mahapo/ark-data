00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:21.830 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who served

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Today, we discuss a secret
program called the S-DART.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.335 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the program.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What is the S-DART?

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.080 align:middle line:90%
What's that stand for?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: S-DART stands for
Special Downed Aircraft Recovery

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:10%
Team.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: What can you
tell us about that?

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well,
back in the 1940s,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.240 align:middle line:84%
late '40s, when
the first aircraft,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial craft,
crashed in New Mexico,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force and Army realized
that they needed some kind

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of special team to
recover these crafts.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So in 1953, the S-DART was
created by the Air Technical

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Center, which is
out of Wright-Patterson Air

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Force Base in Ohio.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what was the
inspiration for this program

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:90%
to begin with?

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they needed a
specialized team to recover

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
these nonhuman,
intelligent crafts,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The regular crash recovery teams
were for conventional aircrafts

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
or military aircrafts during
that time period, the Army,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Air Force crafts.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And as our technology developed,
we realized at some point

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that we needed advanced
recovery operations

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to analyze and recover these
extraterrestrial crafts

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:90%
from some other planet.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why scientists
got together and realized,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's put together some
type of team specialists

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
that can recover these
nonhuman intelligence crafts.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what makes it
different than the DART?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.787 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: Well, the
difference in a DART,

00:02:07.787 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:10%
the DART is just the team
that recovers crash or wrecked

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:10%
military aircrafts.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
The S put in front of
it, the special team,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
signifies a specialized team
with specialists on board

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:90%
that can go out and analyze it.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
As our recovery process
progressed because there were

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of crashes in the late
'40s, '50s, and '60s and right

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.880 align:middle line:84%
into the '70s and '80s and even
today that we realized that we

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
need specialists, because
there's a lot of things that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
could happen at the
scene of a nonhuman,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:90%
intelligent craft crash.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with a
foreign technology.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:90%
These crafts could be hazardous.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
They could be dangerous, and
the occupants could be hostile.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.775 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:02:57.775 --> 00:03:00.067 align:middle line:84%
Especially all the different
advancements in technology

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
every year, they probably have
to bring on new specialists

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:90%
every few months, probably.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
When we find a craft, of
course, we recover it.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:84%
We take it to Area 51 and/or
Tonopah Air Force Base,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and then we analyze it.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, back in the late
'40s and '50s, our technology

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
hadn't advanced enough to
understand some technology

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that's probably 1,000 or 10,000
years more advanced than we are.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
And so we were lost.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to bring
in top scientists

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out, how
do we analyze these things?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's set up some kind of a
plan to analyze these things.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And as our technology
advanced, we

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:84%
were more capable of
understanding their technology.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, you mentioned
Tonopah, where a lot of this--

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:90%
whatever is retrieved.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They take it to these
different places.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But where are these S-DART
teams actually stationed?

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:90%
How many are there?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Where around the world are they?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, in the
beginning, there were 11 teams.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were stationed
at Edwards Air Force Base,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Tonopah Test Range-- that's what
it was called before it became

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Tonopah Air Force Base--

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Cleveland Air Force Base, one
at Nellis, Langley, Virginia,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Langley Air Force Base,
oversees in Central Germany,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:90%
in Wiesbaden.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the Asian area,
Japan had a team.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, over the years,
they've managed

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
to move more of the
detachments from those--

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
like, for instance, at Tonopah,
it was at Detachment 2.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, they have one at
Hill Air Force Base, which

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:90%
is controlled out of Tonopah.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So now there's a different team
and a different designation

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:90%
for that team.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But now there's probably,
I think, 16 or 17

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
around the world, meaning
all over the world.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:90%
No, I understand.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:90%
So who's chosen for these teams?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And how are they chosen?

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, in the beginning,
they used the conventional DART

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:90%
recovery team assignments--

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:84%
a pilot, somebody that knew
an aircraft, some systems

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
engineers, some airframe
mechanics and things like that,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.170 align:middle line:90%
fuel system mechanics.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And then when we realized
that these crafts weren't

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:90%
like our crafts.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
They weren't
conventional crafts.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have a gas tank.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have avionics
like we would have.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so now these
people were lost.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
These experts
couldn't understand

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:90%
what they were dealing with.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, they've added
specialists, some of them out

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
of Los Alamos, some of them out
of Sandia National Laboratories,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:90%
some out of MIT.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
They have some
specialized physicians

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.128 align:middle line:84%
trained at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology--

00:05:53.128 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY:
Astrobiologist-type people.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.592 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:05:55.592 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And they put those
guys on a team

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
because they have the experience
of all those years of dealing

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:90%
with these NHIs.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the team
is organized today.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But back in the '40s, '50s,
and '60s, we were just learning

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:84%
about the nonhuman
intelligence technology.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And so these people
had to be trained.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So after every craft
crash site, they

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
went ahead and gathered the
evidence in an after action

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.350 align:middle line:84%
report and realized,
OK, we need to add

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:90%
this specialist to the team.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.155 align:middle line:84%
Like, for instance, an
incident happened in Nevada,

00:06:32.155 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:90%
in 1964, Red Ant, Nevada.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Miners watched a craft
come over them and crashed

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So three miners got into a
vehicle and drove out there.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they got there, they
found this saucer-shaped objects

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:90%
embedded into a mound of dirt.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And the bottom hatch opened.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So one of the miners went
up and into the craft.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately got
nauseated, extremely sick

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:90%
to his stomach.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:90%
He got out.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
The other miners took
him away from the craft,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
and then he was all right.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So they immediately went back
and notified the authorities,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:90%
the county sheriff.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the DART team
out of Tonopah Test Range

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:90%
came out to recover the craft.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's just an example
of these miners had

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.666 align:middle line:90%
no idea what this thing was.

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know anything
about nonhuman intelligence.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
These bodies laying
around were not human.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They recognized them
as being not human,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know
where they came from.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And the inside of the craft
made this one miner nauseated.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.443 align:middle line:84%
That means there's
something inside of that,

00:07:39.443 --> 00:07:42.292 align:middle line:84%
whether it was fumes or
whether it was something

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:43.375 align:middle line:90%
that they were breathing--

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.208 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Radiation,
electromagnetic fields.

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Any of those things,
and they just didn't know it.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, he recovered.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But this is just an example that
told the DART team guys now.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
They're going to wear
special suits, a respirator,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.015 align:middle line:84%
hazardous material
personal protective suits.

00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Richard, now,
through my experience, too,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
and through what I've
been through, I mean,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
maybe tell the audience this is
happening a lot more often where

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
civilians are there before the
actual S-DART teams get there.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I've seen so many reports
where there's actually

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
a protocol when you get there,
if there are civilians there.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, there
was a set protocol.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Every team has an
OSI agent on team,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:84%
who is in the Special Projects
Branch, who especially briefed

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.095 align:middle line:90%
into these type of programs.

00:08:30.095 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's a
counterintelligence officer.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And his job is to
disinform the people who

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:90%
found if they were civilians.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
A lot of time, they're
ex-military or police officers,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
highway patrolman,
state troopers.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it's easier to
debrief them in a way

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
that they won't talk than
it is for some person that

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
has no connection whatsoever
with the government

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
or the military for
us to come in and try

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
to sway them away from reporting
what they actually saw.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
methods and different levels

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of what we can do.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:84%
At the scene, we
try to disinform

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:90%
them, deception operations.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't work, then we
notify those guys at 7,602nd Air

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Intel out of Fort Belvoir.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:90%
They're the real men in black.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They are.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And they can come
down and do things that we

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't normally do.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
We could probably do
some of those things,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
but we let them do it because
they're more trained to do it.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we get
out of the picture

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and let them do whatever
they need to do, maybe scare

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
them or threaten them or
whatever, then disinform them

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:84%
of reporting what
they actually saw.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I've even seen them
go as far as to even talk

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
to the media and change their
minds about what is actually

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.502 align:middle line:90%
presented or written.

00:09:47.502 --> 00:09:48.335 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard this?

00:09:48.335 --> 00:09:49.335 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Every media outlet in the
nation, at least when I was in,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
had a source of information
we called them-- not a spy,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
but we call them a
source of information--

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that could manipulate the news
feed from a situation like that.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And we would
contact that person.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Like in Albuquerque, I
had somebody in control

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:90%
of every single news media--

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.087 align:middle line:84%
radio, television, local
television channel.

00:10:13.087 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: "Albuquerque Journal."

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The Journal,
The Tribune at that time.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't have The
Tribune anymore.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And we would feed
them a story better

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.313 align:middle line:84%
than what the civilian out
there was feeding them.

00:10:26.313 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It was more juicy.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And plus, we had
little money to pay 'em.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And that
can be used a lot.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And we can pay off the people.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
If somebody saw something and we
had to quiet them or keep them

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
from telling the truth about
an extraterrestrial craft that

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
had crashed, or maybe one of our
top secret crafts that crashed,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
we would do a lot
of different things.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
we'd say, listen,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a little pocket of
money here that I can pay you,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
pay you in segments

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:90%
to keep your mouth shut.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:90%
And we've done that

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Richard, have you
ever heard of a,

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a crash site happen,
a real extraterrestrial vehicle

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:84%
came down, and OSI came in, and
they told the people around them

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't an
extraterrestrial craft?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It was our experimental craft.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.237 align:middle line:90%
They were downplaying it.

00:11:21.237 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Absolutely.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.403 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: So that happens a lot?

00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Numerous times.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Numerous times.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what Paul Bennewitz was
saying in a Paul Bennewitz case

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
back in the early '80s, we kind
of played that disinformation

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:90%
campaign against him.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And so there's--

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.417 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I read that.

00:11:37.417 --> 00:11:41.298 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --many other cases that
we would do something like that.

00:11:41.298 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there some sort of
narrative that would come out

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:84%
that we would recognize
today in the media?

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes, a Tic Tac.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The Tic
Tac, of course.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Or the shootdown of
those objects over Alaska,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
the Yukon in Canada, or Lake
Huron in the Great Lakes area.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a typical.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
That would be something typical
that immediately the government

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
got a hold of and started
misfeeding the public of what

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:90%
actually happened.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Tic Tac is
absolutely a perfect case

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
because when that happened, you
look at all the different people

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.091 align:middle line:84%
that were involved
in that, the pilots,

00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
the people in the
combat alert center,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Kevin Day, many other
people who I've spoken with.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
There's scenarios that
they knew something

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:84%
because when a helicopter
lands, a black helicopter

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
lands on a carrier with
civilians getting out,

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and they're saying they're OSI.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.125 align:middle line:84%
Kevin Day said, they were
all OSI Air Force people.

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know what
Air Force people do on a Navy,

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
craft because we have
the Office of Naval

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence or the Naval
Criminal Investigation Service,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:90%
not the OSI.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But OSI went in and
got all the tapes.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can understand
that because the OSI

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
is aligned and does all the work
for the Defense Intelligence

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And those tapes, radar
tapes, the tracking tapes

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
would then belong to the
Defense Intelligence Agency, not

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:90%
the Navy.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the Air
Force went in there,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
because the Air Force does all
the dirty work for the DIA.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they picked
them up and took them back to--

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know now that
some of those OSI agents

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:84%
were out of Hickam Air
Force Base in Hawaii.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that came
out later In 2010.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the OSI
agents, although he

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
didn't tell the whole
story, he admits

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that he was one of them that was
transported from one location

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.698 align:middle line:84%
to another on that ship to
pick up those radar tapes.

00:13:34.698 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Just for those tapes.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Are those the originals?

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Or does a satellite
also record that?

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: You know,
that's a good question.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I always wondered.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the satellite
probably did because every--

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how
classified that would be.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:90%
But every time a carrier group--

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not Navy.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
But a carrier group
is an aircraft carrier

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
with a number of
ships and submarines.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Every time they go out, there's
a satellite tracking them.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure how
that would work.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure if they had
satellite tapes of that,

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
they would be in hands of the
Defense Intelligence Agency now.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So,
Richard, the Tic Tac--

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:84%
let's just get to
the bottom of this--

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:90%
was that extraterrestrial craft?

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Was it reverse-engineered-craft?

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, to listen to
the pilots that were in the air

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:90%
encountering these objects--

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and these pilots are
professional Navy pilots,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
went through years of training
to be in that cockpit,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:90%
flying that advanced aircraft.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:84%
To listen to them
explain exactly what

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:84%
they saw dictated that
it wasn't one of ours.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:10%
It defied gravity.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:10%
It defied any type of avionics
or aerodynamics that we had.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:10%
And of course, these
guys hadn't been--

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.050 align:middle line:10%
and girl.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:10%
There was one female.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:10%
They hadn't been trained--

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Or debriefed.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --or debriefed in
anything extraterrestrial,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and they admitted that.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:90%
But afterwards, they were.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
That's amazing that after
they saw something-- now,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.095 align:middle line:84%
if this was one of ours,
something advanced,

00:15:13.095 --> 00:15:14.965 align:middle line:90%
maybe a Bigelow-created object--

00:15:14.965 --> 00:15:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Raytheon-Bigelow
thing, yeah.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --why would they then
be debriefed later and then

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
briefed on nonhuman
intelligence crafts?

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Why would they do that?

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Navy did that.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.295 align:middle line:90%
And why would they do that?

00:15:27.295 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: To
discombobulate them, yeah.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That means that they
could have encountered something

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:90%
like this in the future.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Then they would know it was--

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
now, the only problem
with that story

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
is that before the alert
aircrafts on that ship, the two

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:84%
F-18s, before this exercise,
every carrier group,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
as I was explained
by one of the pilots,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
had two alert aircrafts 24
hours a day, 365 days a year

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
with weapons on board, AMRAAM
or Sidewinder missiles.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So if anything comes within the
area of the aircraft carrier,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
those things would
launch and shoot it down.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that day, they
took all the weapons off.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So those two alert aircrafts did
not have any weapons systems on.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.772 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we already knew that
something was going to happen--

00:16:15.772 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Someone knew.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --they don't want
us to shoot down something.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can look
at it two ways.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
You can look at it, number
one, that was something that we

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.690 align:middle line:90%
were testing against the fleet.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Or number two, we knew
that these things,

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:90%
we couldn't shoot down.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had some kind
of defensive mechanism

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:90%
that could harm the fleet.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't want an armed
aircraft up there trying

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to shoot down something
that could harm the fleet.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a admiral
who has come forth.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That's his story,
that he believes

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that these were nonhuman
intelligence crafts,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and that they had a mechanism, a
defense mechanism on board that

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:84%
could harm our
aircrafts and the fleet.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want them
to do that, obviously.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't arm
the alert aircrafts.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The alert aircrafts just
went up and flew around

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
and spotted it and photographed
them and the gun cameras,

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:90%
but they couldn't shoot it down.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's probably why.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was the misinformation
team saying that they were

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:84%
an actual UFO because they
were trying to protect

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
our reverse-engineered vehicles?

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
could very well be.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But the problem there
is there has not

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
been any information
leaked out after that

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that those
things, those Tic Tacs

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
were, in fact, ours,
our technology.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we have scientists that
spoke at UFO conventions 5 and 6

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and 7 years later who had
worked in reverse engineering,

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
saying they aren't anything that
we have ever seen at Papoose S2

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:90%
or at Tonopah or at Area 51.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So he doubts that they
were, in fact, ours.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:90%
But that's a good point.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.710 align:middle line:84%
You could do that in
a deception operation.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
You could confuse the public
by putting both stories out,

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:84%
totally confusing the public,
and leaking different stories,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:84%
which I have done in the past
in disinformation or deception

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
operations to really
confuse the public.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So the public, if
they get so confused,

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
they just let that
story aside and believe

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:90%
whatever they want to believe.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But to try to convince
one way or the other,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.668 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult if
the information has

00:18:35.668 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:90%
been out there for a long time.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But isn't it
possible that Bigelow Aerospace

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
or Raytheon could have
craft that, of course,

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
the military would
not know about?

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: This is 2004.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
Roosevelt incident

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:90%
happened some time later.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, during
now, I mean, years later,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
we could very well
have something

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know about whether
we had it in that time frame.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
There are people saying, both
sides of it, yes, we did.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:90%
And no, we--

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It can go
many directions, right?

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Which makes it
very confusing for everyone.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the government
wants, to confuse the public.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:90%
That's disinformation.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.887 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, that brings
us to the next question,

00:19:18.887 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
is basically, why are
these nonterrestrial crafts

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
or let's just say these nonhuman
terrestrial crafts crashing

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.937 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:19:28.937 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, that's
a good question.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of different
opinions by scientists

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and aeronautical engineers
of why they crash.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the theories is that
when an extraterrestrial craft

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
flies from wherever they're
coming from into our atmosphere,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
there's things in
our atmosphere,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
such as the Van Allen belt,
and our atmosphere that

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
contains things that they
don't have on their planet.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they come in, it
affects their control systems,

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and they realize now
they're in trouble.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
They either try to do a control
crash or a control landing,

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
or their mechanisms for flight
just becomes inoperative,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and then they crash.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's what their theory is.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're
dealing with technology

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that's more advanced
than we are,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different planet
that may be light years away

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:90%
from us.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And we don't understand
their technology.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really difficult
for our scientists.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:90%
And they do analyze it.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:90%
They try to at the scene.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
works against us is, number one,

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
we don't have a voice
recorder that we can

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:90%
bring out and look at the data.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't have equipment that can
scan their avionics equipment.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, we can't even
find their avionics equipment.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
what it's made of.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
difficulties we have.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the mountain that we have
to climb to try to figure out

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.555 align:middle line:90%
how these things crash.

00:21:06.555 --> 00:21:07.355 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:21:07.355 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have a personal question
here since I live in Las Vegas.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And down the road a
while back, a craft

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
crashed in the backyard of
a regular civilian home,

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:90%
neighborhood.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.820 align:middle line:90%
And I read a classified report--

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
it's real or not--

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that said, it wasn't
a crash landing.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
They were having
mechanical problems.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
controlled crash landing.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.792 align:middle line:84%
Are you allowed to talk
about that, first of all?

00:21:35.792 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you
did a big thing.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.197 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, we did
a major investigation.

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Our group, the
advanced working group,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
did a major
investigation on that.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
We had 11 people, all retired
federal agents or intelligence

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
officers out there for
weeks and weeks at a time,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
interviewing the family
members in Spanish.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
We had Spanish-speaking
investigators.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:10%
And we came to the
conclusion, looking

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:10%
at some of the film
that hasn't been

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.332 align:middle line:10%
released that they won't
release now, but we did see it--

00:22:03.332 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: That's a good sign.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.607 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: --that these
things were not human.

00:22:06.607 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:10%
They were definitely not--

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Definitely not human.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: --human.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:10%
The pictures that we saw--

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:10%
and I wasn't out there, but our
other people were out there--

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:10%
looked like extraterrestrials,
the typical extraterrestrials

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:10%
that were nonhuman.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle line:90%
But they were really tall.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:90%
They were--

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:20.862 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very tall, yes.

00:22:20.862 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:90%
I saw the pictures.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --yeah,
8 to 10 feet tall.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
has never been released

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:84%
is the property
directly to the east

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:90%
had a camera in their backyard.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the creatures
came over his fence,

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
hit a swimming
pool, and picked up

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
water out of that swim or
did something with water.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't really see what it was
doing, but it was kneeling down.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't drinking
the water, but it

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.598 align:middle line:84%
looked like they
were putting water

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of a container.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I saw it.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But those things,
they were not human.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The way he jumped,
the way it jumped up

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
based on that lamp post
that was in the back, which

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.640 align:middle line:84%
was 6 foot tall, it was at
least 2 feet taller than that.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.252 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking at
8 to 10 feet tall.

00:23:04.252 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the
fence was 6 feet.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Right.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Jumped over and went back.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it did something
to either repair itself

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and then took off and
landed over in Lake Mead.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
A large military
presence was over there.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:90%
We tracked it.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:84%
We talked to people
camping out there.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:84%
They see these military
convoys pulling up.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing out there?

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And then the story drops.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Why did the United
States government

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
obtain a FISA warrant to
search their property?

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Why did they surreptitiously
say, go in the government

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:90%
and put cameras up in there?

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is after the fact.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And why did a man
who was supposed

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
to be a high voltage electrician
who was driving around

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that night, and people saw him--
in fact, other doorbell cameras

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
seeing this truck with
a company name on it.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Spurlock Corporation.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And there's no such company.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:84%
This guy that had gone to a
number of different houses,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:90%
he was up on a telephone pole.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is before
the incident happened.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:90%
And now they can't find the guy.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:90%
They can't find the company.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not licensed
anywhere in Nevada.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Some people say they've
seen that truck going out

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.573 align:middle line:84%
towards Rachel,
probably the Area 51.

00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I heard this, yes.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so now you
put all this together,

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and this is a major cover-up by
the United States government.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
involving extraterrestrials.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's two
different stories here.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.070 align:middle line:84%
One story is that this
thing, these entities

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:90%
lived out in Area 51.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:90%
They lived out there.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to
demonstrate this craft to us,

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:90%
but then something happened.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.232 align:middle line:84%
And they had to land and
repair it in some way.

00:24:48.232 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's
what I heard, yes.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And then it took
back off and another problem.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And the second story is that--

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:84%
it was something that
came in because there's

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
a radar site over near
Baker, California, FAA site

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that tracked that thing all the
way over to North Las Vegas.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.885 align:middle line:90%
So what do you want to believe?

00:25:09.885 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might
have been a story

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
generated by the United States
government as disinformation.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
confusing part of this.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And now the people are gone.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:90%
They don't live there anymore.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.865 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Get them out of
here and change the names.

00:25:23.865 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Relocate.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: They relocated them.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:84%
What's the S-DART
protocol for that?

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
What would it be today if you
can go over that really quick?

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: It would have been
for the team out of Nellis,

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
which was the closest team,
obviously just a few miles away,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
actually, to respond and connect
with the North Las Vegas Police

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:84%
or Vegas Metropolitan Police
Department and coordinate

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
a recovery operation.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But the problem there
is that although there

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:84%
were OSI agents that
were at that scene

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
45 minutes after those
two officers arrived--

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
there was two OSI agents.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:90%
And we know who their names are.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And we know they were stationed
out of Nellis Air Force base.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.618 align:middle line:84%
They responded there,
again, 45 minutes after.

00:26:08.618 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
It was like 1 o'clock
in the morning.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's fast.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:90%
So how did they know?

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we understand,
you're going back

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:90%
to the chain of events.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:84%
The dispatcher, somebody
in the dispatch office,

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
the central dispatch
for Las Vegas,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
told one of the dispatchers
call Nellis Air Force Base

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and briefed them on this to see
if they tracked it or something.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:90%
So she did.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:90%
She called Nellis command post.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.005 align:middle line:84%
And then 45 minutes later,
two OSI agents were on scene.

00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Incredible.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So if this wasn't
anything, this wasn't nothing,

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
this was just a hoax, OSI
agents wouldn't respond.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:84%
They were both out of the
Special Projects Branch.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And why would they respond out
of something that was a hoax?

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:84%
They would respond when
something was real.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.246 align:middle line:90%
And they'd notified the S-DART.

00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, before
the S-DART ever got there,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.660 align:middle line:84%
this thing, the craft
had taken back off

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.090 align:middle line:90%
and flew over towards Lake Mead.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I understand,
the S-DART team

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:84%
did go over there because it
was spotted over there on radar,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't crash over there.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
It landed on some little island
out in the middle of Lake Mead

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:84%
to do something,
like maybe get water,

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:84%
or we don't know,
and took back off.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was tracked on radar all
the way past Houston, Texas.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was flying in the
southeast for some reason

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:90%
at great altitudes.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
the FAA at McCarran,

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
or Harry Reid Airport
now it's called,

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
they tracked something that came
from 65,000 feet down to 2,000

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
feet in a matter
of a few seconds.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't have
anything like that.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:84%
We have no aircrafts
that I know of--

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and pilots have seen
this information.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.080 align:middle line:90%
We showed them.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Can you descend in 3 seconds?

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't do it.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:90%
It'll kill us.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:90%
So how did they do that?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.155 align:middle line:90%
And was it the same craft?

00:28:15.155 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if that was the
same craft or the craft that

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
landed in that back yard
was a different craft.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
that descended

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.670 align:middle line:84%
that quick at the
same time period,

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.363 align:middle line:90%
and that was tracked on radar.

00:28:30.363 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I was there
the following day,

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.770 align:middle line:90%
and it was swamped.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were already
installing cameras

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
down that road and, in the
back yard, military cameras.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Rick, we talked about
these 8 to 10-feet beings.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I read some
things in the report.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.690 align:middle line:84%
What's your take on the craft
size that was in the backyard?

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: This is
about 20 feet high.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was twice the size,
but it wasn't very big.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It was very slender.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Very slender.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:90%
It was a two-occupant craft.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And there were two occupants
in it that came out.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And one was filmed
from a distance,

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
but the other one had
jumped over that fence.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
You could see it plain
as day on that camera.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they weren't
large beings.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:90%
They were skinny but tall.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very tall, yeah.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And the
craft was the same.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:90%
So it was probably just two.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It was maybe a scout ship or
some kind of an observation

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:24.858 align:middle line:90%
or reconnaissance ship.

00:29:24.858 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And we have to
understand the different types

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:90%
of physics.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:90%
The craft size doesn't matter.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
You've seen this
before, where you

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
have beings that are very large,
and the craft is really small.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't make
sense, but it makes sense

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
because it changes
your atomic structure.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's a classical
example of this

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:84%
the doctor put up, who I used to
work for, wrote about the fact

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.858 align:middle line:84%
that the exterior of the
craft doesn't mean anything.

00:29:49.858 --> 00:29:51.525 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
outside of the craft,

00:29:51.525 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:90%
it could be 10 feet wide.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But you look inside, the
size of a football field.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.370 align:middle line:90%
How can that happen?

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:84%
He explains in details
how that can occur.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.113 align:middle line:84%
And with our physics,
that could happen.

00:30:04.113 --> 00:30:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's amazing, yes.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Were these teams ever
met with resistance

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:90%
from beings from a downed craft?

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yes, I know one
instance in Box Elder,

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:84%
South Dakota, which is real
close to Ellsworth Air Force

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.810 align:middle line:90%
A craft crashed in the '60s.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it crashed,
it was tracked on radar.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Air Force, back then,
they were called

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Air Police, responded to the
scene, set up a perimeter.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
An on-scene commander came
out in the rank of a colonel.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.080 align:middle line:90%
And they called the DART team.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.095 align:middle line:84%
And the closest DART team
was at Tonopah at that time.

00:30:42.095 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But they took them
some time to get there.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
There was one live
extraterrestrial that

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.400 align:middle line:90%
was detained by the Air Police.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.430 align:middle line:84%
They put him in a vehicle
because they didn't--

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:90%
in the back of a police vehicle.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.218 align:middle line:90%
And he disappeared or escaped.

00:30:59.218 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Dematerialized, yeah.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so they did
a massive search for it

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:90%
and eventually found it.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.220 align:middle line:90%
It was close to the air base.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this being had
gone towards the air base

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.320 align:middle line:84%
rather than away
from the air base.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And where they
found this being--

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.790 align:middle line:90%
it is really remarkable--

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And this is amazing.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --is inside the
nuclear weapons storage area.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, it seems like
this thing was maybe

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:84%
attracted towards radiation or
nuclear material or something.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they found it right
next to the perimeter.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it actually had
gotten inside what the Air

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Force would call a WSA, a
Weapon Storage Area, which is

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear weapon storage area.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was close to the
fence, and perimeter guards

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:90%
had tracked it.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And they put a net over it.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, when
the DART team got there,

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:57.120 align:middle line:84%
they had the means to put it
in some kind of a vehicle,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and they transported
it to Area 51.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But that was one of the
ones that we had captured,

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:90%
and that was in the '60s.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
form of resistance

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.145 align:middle line:84%
between the extraterrestrial
and our military force.

00:32:11.145 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And for the
audience, let them know

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that's an incredible distance
from the crash site to the fence

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:90%
And they got there.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It got there.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:90%
But it was as if it was--

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
maybe it knew that there
was some radiation.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why they
always go towards radiation.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.810 align:middle line:84%
There's so many cases out
there where these things

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:84%
appear inside or near nuclear
weapons or nuclear weapons

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.755 align:middle line:90%
storage areas.

00:32:39.755 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you describe
what kind of being that was?

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That was Hepaloid I
believe that was a Hepaloid.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It was almost looking
like a human, but it had--

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Smaller?

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: --distorted features.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:84%
No, I think it was 5'7", 5'8"
feet and distorted features.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the report, it just
said distorted features.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't go into
details of exactly

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
compartmented remember?

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.790 align:middle line:84%
They put the
generalized description.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But anything else,
you'd have to go

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.505 align:middle line:84%
to another annex of the report
to look and see exactly what--

00:33:13.505 --> 00:33:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Distorted features
means what for the audience?

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I would say
distorted facial features,

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
might have had some kind
of headwear on, helmet,

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:90%
maybe something on their arms.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were wearing
a suit that would

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.557 align:middle line:90%
distort their regular features.

00:33:28.557 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't see their
features because they

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.410 align:middle line:90%
had something on the outside.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Once we
have the craft,

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.640 align:middle line:90%
what kind of test are performed?

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And what do we learn
from that, Rick?

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: We learn by experience.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So the more crashes that we
investigate, the more we learn.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But the idiosyncrasy there is
they're not all the same crafts,

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.540 align:middle line:90%
all the same technologies.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:84%
We learned that
in the early days.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I read a long document
back in the '80s about how

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.320 align:middle line:84%
our technology advanced
towards understanding these

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial crafts.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The first one we encountered,
at least I was briefed in,

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:90%
was 1947 at Corona, New Mexico.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the Eben craft.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.460 align:middle line:84%
That's a craft that we studied
for all those different years,

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:90%
and we knew a lot about it.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:84%
And we had one live
extraterrestrial in captivity

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:90%
from '47 to '52.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:84%
He gave us information about
how the craft operated,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:84%
communications,
the power system.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:84%
But the 1953 Kingman craft crash
was a different type of craft.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen
one of those before.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in '49, we found
another Eben craft, same craft.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So that made us think that
they're all the same. in '53,

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.710 align:middle line:90%
we found it's different.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
So we, over the years,
developed different types

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:84%
of tests, examination
criteria to try to determine,

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:84%
number one, which species was
flying it, where they came from.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
I think they've

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:84%
developed advanced systems
and test systems to determine

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:84%
the creature which
species they were

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.485 align:middle line:90%
and what technology there was.

00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, what are
the origins of these craft

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and the beings?

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about that?

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they're
coming from all over.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.260 align:middle line:90%
There's the Eben craft.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:26.220 align:middle line:84%
They have the Quantaloids, the
Trantaloids, the Hepaloids.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:84%
At least back then,
there were only five.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I understand now there's--

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.490 align:middle line:90%
well, seven.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:90%
But now I understand there's 21.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe they,
the extraterrestrials,

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:84%
had announced to the
universe that we're

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.537 align:middle line:90%
a strange planet out here.

00:35:43.537 --> 00:35:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And now they're all coming
to look at us, I think.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.597 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this
program still ongoing?

00:35:47.597 --> 00:35:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The program
is still ongoing.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How does this factor
into the disclosure narrative

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Well, it's leaked out.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
whistleblowers out there

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:84%
that have had
hands-on experience.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
whistleblowers right now

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that have already been
briefed by the DOD IG and RO

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:84%
telling their
stories about having

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:84%
hands-on experience on
a crash recovery team

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.570 align:middle line:84%
in different parts
of the United States.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're here to tell us
about what they experienced.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And some of their experiences
are literally out of this world.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
we have right now.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And those
whistleblowers, they need

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.860 align:middle line:84%
to speak to the American public
to explain exactly what they did

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and what they saw and what
they experienced when they were

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.325 align:middle line:90%
on these crash recovery teams.

00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.050 align:middle line:84%
