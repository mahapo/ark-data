>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:10%
we're with former US
Marine Mike Herrera.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
Distinguished Service record.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:10%
Today we discuss
UAP and disclosure.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE HERRERA: It feels
good to be back, Emery.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: To what degree is
the private industry involved

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:84%
with UAPs compared to the
military's involvement?

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, I will sum
it up to two words, money

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and oversight.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Private, obviously, because
you can't FOIA request anything

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
in a private industry
because of the roadblocks

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that they intentionally
set up for that way,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to government
involvement, which

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are
seeing these days.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
There's pretty much a
lot of FOIA requests

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that you can find
that articulate things

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.732 align:middle line:90%
in a specific manner.

00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted, it takes
a little bit of time,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.148 align:middle line:84%
but I think money
and oversight are

00:01:02.148 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
the biggest things
are private compared

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:90%
to military involvement.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, does the industry
work for the private military?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: To an extent.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:90%
It's hand in hand.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just kind of like this.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:90%
It's intersecting.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So they're pulling people from
the military side of things

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and putting them
into private sectors

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.793 align:middle line:84%
so that way they already
have the expertise,

00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:23.002 align:middle line:84%
they already have the
structure implemented for that.

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you carry it over, it's
already implemented naturally.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
They really don't have
to change anything.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, these
guys are getting

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.277 align:middle line:84%
paid a lot more money
on the private end

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
compared to military
or a government.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, what kind
of aerospace companies

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
are involved with UAPs
and to what degree?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Which one isn't?

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
That's more the
answer I can give.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.517 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these aerospace
companies have technologies.

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's a
lot of competition.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Well, there is.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what I saw.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And a lot of them
are, as a matter of fact,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because now that
there's talks still

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
on the back end of
the legislation being

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.295 align:middle line:90%
pushed through.

00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And we already saw what
happened with the bill they

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.128 align:middle line:84%
put that was gutted,
and that's obviously

00:01:58.128 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
because there's people embedded
with these aerospace companies

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that are paying them large sums
of money to keep quiet about it

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.498 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, don't
look over here.

00:02:05.498 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Look here instead.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing
in live time right now

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
is stuff on the back end
that, for my personal account,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
as far as what the
Pentagon put out,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
the AARO report, which
said completely opposite

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:90%
of what I testified to.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So now that the
public's aware of that,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
they actually see, OK,
something's not right here.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So ever since last year when I
came forward, a lot of people

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:84%
are saying that I've
been public with what

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:90%
I've been talking about.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And it spans even from
the initial press club

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that I did talking
about what I did see,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden
being involved with this group

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what really is
behind the scenes and why.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm glad that
happened because now you're

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
holding the government
accountable,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
as the public should be, because
that's the intention of it.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.647 align:middle line:84%
But now you're seeing what
the Pentagon and AARO are

00:02:54.647 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:90%
doing are completely reversed.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's intentional
because they

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
don't want to acknowledge
the human aspect

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.495 align:middle line:84%
of reverse engineered
technologies.

00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is because they

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.162 align:middle line:84%
will have to explain to
everybody why we're still

00:03:05.162 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
running on fossil fuels.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.682 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they're changing
your verbiage of actually

00:03:08.682 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:90%
what you testified to.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And giving the
public a different--

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:84%
trying to get them
to go to the side.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Not listening to
actually what you said.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which is
completely illegal.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Yes, it's
defamation at that point.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's just-- it's
frustrating to see that,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
but I'm relieved that at least
I put myself under that fire

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
to at least show the world that,
hey, there's something going on.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it shows
that they are doing--

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:90%
that they're being negligent.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because we can
compare those papers.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Well, exactly.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I've got my notes.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
The public has
their notes of what

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about
extensively, even on Gaia.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So at least people are
paying attention to that.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the
aspect of the ETs

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
per se that they
want to keep quiet.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the technology
that we've already had

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:90%
that they want to keep quiet.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They don't care
about the ET involvement.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.343 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They don't want
people to know we've had this

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:84%
technology in excess of 100
years to why we're still running

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
our archaic technologies from
the 1800s, realistically,

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:90%
to now?

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why wouldn't
they care about the ETs?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.702 align:middle line:90%
And if not, who is?

00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well,
I think the public

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.057 align:middle line:84%
is more interested in
the ET involvement.

00:04:15.057 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
That's old news to the
private and military.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we know--

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's what I see.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So it's harder
to prove the ET involvement

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
because they're
obviously in space.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:90%
They're in our skies.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:90%
So people see that.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
The AI technology
that's came out,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that people are replicating
videos and trying

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to see that they have something
factual when it's not, I mean,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to debunk
that compared

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to actual materials
sitting in a hangar

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
or in a compartmentalized
facility

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that you can walk into
and see stuff like that.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot harder
to disprove that.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I can add to that that even
the government has problems

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:90%
when they see things online.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
People are submitting
these AI videos and AI

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
sounds of alleged sightings
that they actually

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
have to have a department that
has to go and debunk that.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Is everything still highly
compartmentalized or is there

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
like a crossover like
there was in the past?

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.317 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So everything is
highly compartmentalized still,

00:05:13.317 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
but what you have going
on behind the scenes

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:90%
is people trading secrets.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Exchanging
information

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.023 align:middle line:90%
for other information.

00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's how a lot
of this information

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
is intersecting together and in
tune, also connecting the dots.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.382 align:middle line:84%
So when that comes
public and people

00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
start seeing that the
dots are connecting

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
on the back end of corroborating
other things that have already

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:84%
been disclosed compared
to new information that

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:84%
may even further corroborate
things that have already

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
been disclosed.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you mean
they're trading information

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, could
you explain that to us?

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So a lot
of these groups,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
like you know being involved
with yourself at certain points

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.200 align:middle line:84%
of time, you understand
that how you only

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
focused on one particular
project you're working on.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
other person is

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.022 align:middle line:84%
doing that may be in
the same facility.

00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
What happens is,
is now people start

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
to try to trade secrets to say,
hey, what are you working on?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm working on.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they intersect
and basically connect

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:90%
the dots on the back end.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.118 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have
people that come forward

00:06:11.118 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
on that aspect in the public
view that talk about it,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
now it starts to
connect those dots.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
compartmentalization, Mike.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Could you break down
that structure for us?

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Think of it
kind of like a grid.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Every single material or any
kind of faction, if you will,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
would essentially be working
on one particular thing

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that they may be their strengths
involved with that, that may

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:90%
be their better understanding.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Then they have a
different department

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.292 align:middle line:84%
working on some other aspect
that may suit their needs better

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
with specific people
read into that

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:90%
that may have the skill sets.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I personally, I cannot attest
to the structure on that,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:84%
but I can say that people can
probably have a generalization

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
of a grid and every project
put into a single square,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's how it's
compartmentalized.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is the government
part of these programs

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.217 align:middle line:84%
or does it fall under the
military industrial complex,

00:07:01.217 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
like those corporations
you mentioned?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It's
mainly under the MIC

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:90%
or military industrial complex.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is government
involvement with that

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because what people
have to understand

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:84%
is the MIC is funded
by the government.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Exactly.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: So--

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.633 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm glad you said that.

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It's integrated
in with each other.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.967 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
is, is you have

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:22.433 align:middle line:84%
people who are read
up on how this works,

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that are a part
of it because they

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
need to use these people to get
the correct funding and even

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the materials and even
the people involved

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that may be able to
be bribed by money

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
or even coerced in some other
ways to work for the MIC

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
while still carrying
a rank in the military

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
or even associated with
any kind of projects

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that are blue projects
or gray projects and even

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.662 align:middle line:90%
black projects.

00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I can definitely
relate to that, Mike.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:84%
What about the black
projects and the deep black

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:90%
projects that you mentioned?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Could you define
those two for us?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So black
projects are acknowledged

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
by Congress and the Senate as
well as the White House Military

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Office, along with the
President of the United States.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
They have some sort
of awareness to that.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And all that means
is that they are

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
OK with allocating
funds of taxpayer money

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.083 align:middle line:90%
to this said project.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
the details of it.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.958 align:middle line:84%
They just know that
this project is

00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
going to cost in excess of
$450 million, for example.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And it may be some
experimental aircraft,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
it may be some new drone or
it may be a weapon system

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that they have yet to
disclose to the public.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
A deep black project means that
some of the black projects that

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
are acknowledged do not cost
that much to actually build.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, let's
say if it's $450 million

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
when it actually only costs $100
million, the rest of that money

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
gets funneled down to a deep
black project that nobody,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
unless you're read
into that project

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.028 align:middle line:84%
specifically on the
back end, you're not a--

00:08:42.028 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:84%
you're not in Congress,
you're not in the Senate,

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.112 align:middle line:90%
you're not the president.

00:08:45.112 --> 00:08:47.108 align:middle line:84%
You will have no
knowledge that exists.

00:08:47.108 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And they keep it
compartmentalized that way

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.997 align:middle line:84%
while taking the funds
from that black budget.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Understood.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Understood.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us an example,
Mike, of a deep black project?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Deep black project.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
crash retrievals.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: There you go.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: That is a
deep black project.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure is.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And that is
something that's off the books.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, the government has.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Has their own version of that,
or the blue team if you will,

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that use military
assets to do that,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:84%
such as what has been public
already, what I've disclosed,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:84%
which is Joint Special
Operations Command participating

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
in with that, among
other special operations

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.152 align:middle line:84%
components that are doing
the crash retrievals,

00:09:23.152 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is, is they're
handing over those materials

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:90%
to these private sectors.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.277 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
keep it under wraps.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, you
know how debriefing

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
goes with top secret, sensitive
compartmented information.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:90%
That basically gets scrubbed.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
These teams already
then take control of it.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows what
happened and nobody

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
knows what the extent
of it, unless you're

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:90%
on that deep black organization.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where does the funding
come for these secret projects?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.427 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So it's
internal because they

00:09:49.427 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
want to keep these facilities
as well as these projects

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:90%
self-funding.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So they have their own
ways of funding mechanisms

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.738 align:middle line:84%
So when they're working on
behind the scenes of actually

00:10:00.738 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
retrieving material, they
may be selling weapons,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:84%
they may be selling secrets,
they may be selling narcotics

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to different countries,
things like that,

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:84%
on top of funneling funds
from the black projects that

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:90%
are legal.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.875 align:middle line:84%
So they try to be
self-sufficient,

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
but the only thing
that they need

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:84%
is the guaranteed funding from
the government aspect of it.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.942 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So without
that, you don't

00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
think they would
be able to do this

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
with their extracurricular
activities.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.587 align:middle line:84%
It will hinder that to an
extent because now they're

00:10:27.587 --> 00:10:29.420 align:middle line:84%
going to try to get
money in other ways that

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
are going to be too obvious.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's say-- for
example, let's say

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you have an aerospace company
that has this technology,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.133 align:middle line:84%
but all of a sudden they're
found out that they possess this

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
eminent domain

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
happens where they're seized
because they're using taxpayer

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:90%
money to fund this.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.638 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot
of the confusion that

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
lies as these aerospace
companies say,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:90%
that, well, it's our property.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, that may be
true, but how are

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:84%
you building the
property and what funding

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.018 align:middle line:90%
mechanism are you using?

00:10:56.018 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So they'd have to prove that
they're not using the government

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
assets to do that.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point of it.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So now it puts them into
a corner to say, OK, well,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:90%
we're doing it this way.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, but that's illegal.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:84%
There are so many laws being
broken on that end of things,

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.428 align:middle line:84%
so it puts them
more in a corner.

00:11:10.428 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
basically rely off

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:84%
of the funding because it keeps
everything kosher to a degree.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Mike, I've been
debriefed a few times,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and it is second
hand information.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of these
corporations and these black

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
projects hoarding trillions
of dollars in gold, drugs,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and actual hands-on cash
in underground facilities

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:90%
or let's-- per se a mountain?

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:90%
That is-- that's factual.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I know that firsthand.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
stuff that they do

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is based on transactions
only in cash

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.173 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
records kept of it.

00:11:45.173 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And what people
have to understand

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:84%
is that the way that they keep
these facilities safeguarded

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
with information is they keep
very archaic systems in place,

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
such as a filing
system with paperwork.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't do it with
electronic communication

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.562 align:middle line:90%
because that can be intercepted.

00:11:59.562 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
They also have different methods
of electronic communication that

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.478 align:middle line:84%
they can store these onto
that cannot be intercepted.

00:12:04.478 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's intertwined
between both of those.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at some
nuclear arsenal facilities.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are based off of systems
in the '70s on floppy disk

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
systems so they can't be
intercepted by hackers,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
such as Russian intelligence or
Chinese intelligence for that

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
matter, or anybody that could
hack those systems and try

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:90%
to launch a missile that way.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
They can't do that.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.617 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:12:26.617 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So it's
funny when they

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
talk about having cybersecurity
threat for nuclear missiles.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It's all integrated on systems
that are archaic that cannot

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%
be--

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:90%
We use a lot of MS-DOS.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I specialize in that.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%
I got a two-year degree in it.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And we still use those little
floppy disks you're talking

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:90%
about, the 3 and 1/2 inch disk.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I had some of the
larger disks back in the day.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't hold as much, but
they're upgrading those now.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's
top secret information

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
on that point, but it's
still public enough

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to say, hey, I'm
not on any payroll

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%
to say I can't talk about that.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:90%
I know that exists.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
people do, too.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.388 align:middle line:90%
So if they're actually--

00:13:03.388 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I'm not a government
employee for that matter

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not under that kind of
restraint like these individuals

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I agree.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.892 align:middle line:84%
Now, how much is Congress read
into these projects, Mike?

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Thankfully,
some of them

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.977 align:middle line:84%
are being read
into these projects

00:13:15.977 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and they understand that
there's a lot of illegal things

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.817 align:middle line:90%
happening behind the scenes.

00:13:19.817 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the nice
thing, is at least

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:84%
for us as
whistleblowers who have

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
firsthand knowledge of this, we
can then brief these people who

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
actually have the power
of the pen, if you will,

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to actually do something with
a law enforcement initiative

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
or even with legislation that
will help try to mitigate

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the illegal nature of
this because when it comes

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to illegal nature, people have
to understand that people are

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.462 align:middle line:90%
losing their lives off of this.

00:13:42.462 --> 00:13:44.003 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that they're morally

00:13:44.003 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:90%
doing wrong that are not--

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that shouldn't coincide
and exist for that matter

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
with the government
side of things.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So if they're able to
mitigate the illegal nature

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and actually get
oversight on that

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
to help people be held
accountable because that's

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
the other problem, is the
lack of accountability

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.318 align:middle line:84%
onto the deep
black organizations

00:14:03.318 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and the black organizations
for that matter

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
that actually are funded
by government assets,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
so if there's more
oversight on that,

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be a
lot of things mitigated.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When we talk
about black projects

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and deep black projects, what
organization sees over them?

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So deep
black, there's

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
no oversight from any
top end of government.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:90%
That's all self-contained.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.558 align:middle line:84%
It's only the people
who know that.

00:14:26.558 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this is rampant
and that's why a lot of things

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
are happening that people
are starting to catch on to,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
such as murders, such as
even these crash retrievals,

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Even these bases that
have these scalar

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:84%
longitudinal
weapons systems that

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.115 align:middle line:84%
are faster than the
speed of light that

00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
have electromagnetic
technologies onto them

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that basically zap these
craft out of the air.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And they do this to
passenger airplanes

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:84%
as well, private aircraft, not
like jetliners, for example,

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:84%
because that would make
too much of a mess.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It would also put a red
flag over that area to say,

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:90%
what went wrong with this?

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they are keeping
it self-contained,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
it means that they have
people in these groups

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that they can rely on to
keep it self-contained

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:90%
and nothing's going to leak out.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:90%
At least that's what they think.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.232 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you mean
that's what they think?

00:15:11.232 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Well, they think--

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You must
know something.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.872 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, there's
defection going on

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes
because these people that

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
were tricked into being
into these programs

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
are realizing that
they're unconstitutional.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
They're on-- they're
very highly illegal,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and they go against
them morally.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.308 align:middle line:90%
These are patriots.

00:15:27.308 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
These are people, at
least in this country.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, this group is worldwide,
but in this country,

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
there are good
people being tapped

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:84%
into these organizations that
come from special operations

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.437 align:middle line:90%
to do illegal stuff.

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And now that they're finding
out that it's illegal

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and there's no oversight
of it, and they

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:84%
may be in trouble by
guilty of association

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:90%
by being connected to this.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So they want to come
and do the right thing.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.312 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a good
example of that, Mike,

00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
we both know when they
first blew up the Denver

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Base the first time,
there was three scientists

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that were these
patriots that were

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:84%
really afraid for their own
families for the end game.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And they went down there
and risked their lives,

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
gave their life to damage
that part of the base.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know more
specifics about that,

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
but I did hear on the
back end, and that was

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:90%
a real operation that was done.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
patriots, they

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:90%
have their families to risk.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.518 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
what you and I have.

00:16:22.518 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:90%
They have the same thing.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
There are people at
the end of the day.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
care about their families

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and keep them safe because these
groups, while they are still

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
big in comparison,
they're still small enough

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
to know who individually
is who and what they have

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and who they have
as family members,

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:84%
as companies,
whatever it might be.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a risk.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So people understanding that,
why nobody's coming forward?

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.132 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have a
large family or you

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
have things that
you're responsible

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.723 align:middle line:84%
for, such as children,
I know if I had kids,

00:16:52.723 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I probably wouldn't be
sitting in this chair talking

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:90%
to anybody.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably be
quiet about things

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that I've witnessed
because I don't

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
want to risk them to having
being used as leverage.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real thing.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's definitely a
lot of bumping heads down there

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and definitely a
lot of white hats.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a lot
of extortion going on

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
for these scientists
and people down there.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:90%
And security.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.227 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:17:12.227 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: When we're
talking about oversight,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:10%
are we talking about military,
corporation, possibly

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:10%
government?

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: It's all the above.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So a
lot of involvement,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
it's all like as far as
this black organization,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
everything's
intertwined and they're

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
into the blue aspects of
it: media, government,

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
military, even executive
branches, legislative branches,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and the judicial branches.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
fingers into that.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So oversight is intersecting
in between of that.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is,
is when you know

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
somebody has a specific
role in those institutions,

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
they try to see whether
they're coerced by money.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Or if they stumble onto
something they shouldn't have,

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
then that's when obviously
these wetwork operations happen.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, wetworks.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
What about-- how does that fall
into place the entire planet,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:90%
all the different countries?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Is it just those--

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
is it still just kind of the
government and the corporations

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:90%
and the deep black projects?

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: To an extent.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.128 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of
people in the government who

00:18:13.128 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
do not even know that
they're purposefully

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:90%
funding these operations.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything is kind
of trickling down.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And this even goes to the
financial institutions

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
as well, is if
there's overpayments

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and they actually
sequester $0.02 or $0.03

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:90%
from a specific account.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But in the grand
scheme of things,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
on the global side
of things, that

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:84%
translates to still billions
of dollars being made daily

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:84%
for these groups
who are embedded

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.425 align:middle line:84%
with the financial institutions,
if that makes any sense.

00:18:39.425 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, absolutely it does.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.875 align:middle line:84%
So who benefits from keeping
disclosure a big secret here?

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Well, anybody
involved that's making the money

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
off this technology because
they do have spin-off patents--

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Money-oriented.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.345 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:18:51.345 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
They do have spin-off
patents that they

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:90%
utilize that are public.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that filters down
to these people who are really

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
benefiting off of that.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect is
the illegal nature.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they're using
very advanced technologies

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to run drugs across the world,
weapons, which does happen.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my
first initial thought

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
when I witnessed in 2009, was
them doing the drug operation.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.815 align:middle line:84%
And little did I know it
was this recruiting for P3.

00:19:17.815 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And P3 is being the psionic
predisposition potential,

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:84%
which we've talked
about that extensively.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.725 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:26.183 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And
that's if anybody is

00:19:26.183 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
watching that is not
in tune with that,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:90%
they can go back and see that.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.443 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of that nature,
at least the self-funding,

00:19:33.443 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
is all they really care
about, but they have to have

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:90%
the trickling effect--

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They still have to
have it constantly coming in.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, alternatively,
how does humanity

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:90%
benefit from disclosure?

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Disclosure will be in
a sense of medical technologies.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It will be
consciousness-associated

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
technologies, which will
then further us along

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.483 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, which
means that our world will

00:19:54.483 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:90%
change for the matter.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if we get integration
into extraterrestrials

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:84%
or not NHI for
that matter, which

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
is the term that's
properly used these days,

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.242 align:middle line:90%
non-human intelligence.

00:20:04.242 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
If that is the case, and
guess what that means?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:90%
It means that we get to evolve.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:08.527 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:20:08.527 --> 00:20:11.572 align:middle line:84%
Which you have experienced
some nonlinear systems before.

00:20:11.572 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes, I have.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
remarkable technology

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:90%
that I never thought existed.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I love about
it is how it can be accessible.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But the caveat to that
is the bad aspect of it,

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:84%
which these use the
same type of technology

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:90%
to inflict harm and death.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain some of
these consciousness-assisted

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:90%
technologies, these devices?

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:90%
What type of energy do they use?

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Scalar
radionic frequencies.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's SRF is what
they would abbreviate as.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody sees SRF,
that's what it's referring to.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
There may be some other
indications with that.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:84%
But these frequencies
basically hit the human body,

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
or any body for that
matter even if it's not--

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
if it's non-human
intelligence for the matter.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is used to detect
any kind of deformation

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or even defective bacteria
or any defective cells,

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:90%
such as cancer in the body.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:90%
These can detect that.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other caveat to
that is if, let's say, you're

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:84%
these deep black
organizations that

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
have the darker
end of things, then

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
they can use that to
actually create environments

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
in a certain person's body to
expand those bad cells to keep

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:90%
them rampant.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So it goes from a stage one
or maybe even nonexistent

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.990 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, and
they can bring it out.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very scary stuff.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the stuff that they
implement with this technology

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
will induce something that's
very similar to Havana syndrome.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.292 align:middle line:90%
So it gets people that--

00:21:40.292 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Explain the Havana
syndrome to the audience.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So Havana
syndrome basically

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
is anything indicating
with the brain that

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
will have any kind of memory
loss or any kind of damage

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to that to where it can
be life-threatening.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.265 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
it's kind of like--

00:21:54.265 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
it's like a way
of Alzheimer's is

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
the only way I can
describe it, but something

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:90%
that's more severe.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.795 align:middle line:84%
I have not personally
witnessed it to my knowledge.

00:22:01.795 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But we both
know a lot of colleagues

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
who have been hit by scalar
in photometry weapons.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I have, of course,
as you know, a few times.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
But we have a lot of colleagues
that we know personally

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:90%
that have had this.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And that's
something that even--

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.477 align:middle line:90%
I think once they--

00:22:19.477 --> 00:22:21.185 align:middle line:84%
because they have
perfected it, but there

00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:84%
are severities of that
perfection that they've

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:90%
worked with.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the things that
they just want to do in one

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:90%
tap and bang, similar to--

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because firearms
are very traceable.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Poisons, neurotoxins
are very traceable.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
It's something that actually
shows up on a toxicology report.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.097 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to SRF,
they can't detect any of that.

00:22:41.097 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Which stands for?

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Scalar
radiant frequency

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And back in the day,
the biggest thing

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
was car accidents
because there's

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:90%
so many happening every day.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Now they can make you have a
car accident, you're telling me,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:84%
just by taking your sight away
for a little bit at a red light.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Oh yeah.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It
happens all the time.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And medically,
they can explain it.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.010 align:middle line:84%
They say, you may be
succumbing to old age per se,

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you have
myelin sheath that's

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
deteriorating around
your nerves, which

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Alzheimer's
happen that way.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But it also goes to people's
nutrition of what they're

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:90%
putting into their body.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're able to detect what
imperfections a specific person

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.092 align:middle line:90%
has and to elevate that.

00:23:24.092 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If you don't mind me
talking about this classified

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
thing that we visited last week,
they actually have the ability

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
to scan the engine, like
with a CAT scan the car,

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.497 align:middle line:90%
and they could probably--

00:23:37.497 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Sabotage it that way.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Happens all the time.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
What people have to understand
is these people think

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:84%
outside the box and they
have the most brilliant minds

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.865 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
aren't coming from MIT,

00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
that are not coming
from Harvard,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
they're not coming
from Stanford.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.900 align:middle line:90%
They're coming from very--

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:84%
people at a young
age that may have

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:84%
hyper-intelligence to an
extent that they pluck and they

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:90%
put in these programs.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.262 align:middle line:84%
And these people unknowingly
are working on this

00:24:01.262 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're being told one
thing but they're doing another.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And they don't understand
that until it's too late.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time
they're aware of that,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:84%
they try to get out of it
and they're either bribed,

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.972 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of them take the
money because that's the easiest

00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
thing to do, or they're
coerced, threatened violently,

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:90%
or even killed.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they keep a
tight lid on these things.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, if I was
to pay you $1 million right now

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to say, hey, forget my name,
memory, you'd easily do that.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Not you personally, but
just anybody in general

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:90%
would take along the lines.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It's $1 million.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.195 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --because of
the-- no, I'm just kidding.

00:24:36.195 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: But
that's typically--

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No, for sure
they do that all the time.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:90%
And you better take it.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.832 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:24:43.832 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's not
really an option.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's a
one and done offer.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And they know who you
are at that point,

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.072 align:middle line:84%
morally, spiritually, mentally,
what type of person you are.

00:24:55.072 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:84%
When you take that
money, then they

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
can start throwing more
opportunities at you

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
to basically further
their own agenda.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're in this
pickle to begin with.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.227 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: As we say
in the projects here,

00:25:05.227 --> 00:25:09.035 align:middle line:84%
just take this unlimited
credit card, right, Mike, and--

00:25:09.035 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Zeros
out every month.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about it.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's say
you take that then.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.113 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:25:13.113 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You've
got to be careful.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Mike, could you elaborate
a little bit more

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
on this nonlinear
frequency radionic system

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:90%
through your experience?

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:84%
How does it operate
to actually--

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
so the person benefits
from these energies?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So my personal
experience with this

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
is being hooked up to
one of these devices.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And what it does, and it takes
a very long time to have this

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
happen, but it hits your
body with 886,000 different

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way that
I can explain this

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
so somebody can understand this
is almost like echolocation.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you're making a certain
sound and that's emitted back,

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:84%
well, that's a
positive registry.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So it's all harmonic.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So they're hitting it with a
harmonic frequency on that.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:84%
It registers back that,
OK, for example, for me, it

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:84%
picked up a lot of
different bacterias,

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:84%
viruses that I had no idea
that I had in my body,

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
along with osteoporosis, which
has been mitigated to an extent

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So when it registers a certain
frequency that it comes back to,

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that's what it's
elaborating to is,

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, this certain frequency
means that this person has this.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So then they use the
same type of technology

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to put into purified water
to hold that frequency

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:90%
as like an antidote.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you ingest
that frequency,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
it's still hammering down on
that level harmonic frequency

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to actually alleviate
the symptoms

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and actually the causes of
what's creating these problems.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So having the benefit
of that, not only

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.525 align:middle line:84%
having the experience of feeling
20 years younger, no joke,

00:26:42.525 --> 00:26:44.150 align:middle line:84%
the energy levels
are through the roof,

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
appetite is through the roof,
which I haven't had in years.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that is potentially

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:84%
could be readily available to
everybody here in the future.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would encourage
people to take this

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
because you get to know
about yourself on a deeper

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
level, on a cellular level,
not even just with DNA,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.075 align:middle line:84%
but just the atoms and
molecules that your body--

00:27:04.075 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It goes
all the way down

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to the DNA, the RNA,
and the chromosomes.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And it even detects things
that aren't even on set yet

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that have come from a
genetic predisposition

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:90%
that you may have.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
benefited from that.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Mike,
that sounds like it

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:84%
was a reverse engineered
extraterrestrial type of device.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that also is going

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.112 align:middle line:90%
to be disclosed at some point?

00:27:30.112 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: I believe it will.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it'd be one
of the first things

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
if everything is going
the way that it will.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.135 align:middle line:84%
And granted, it's a
tug of war between this

00:27:37.135 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's not going
to happen overnight.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, people
will have benefit--

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
to that technology
to help our bodies

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.035 align:middle line:84%
heal and help
mitigate the problems.

00:27:47.035 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, what people
don't understand

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:84%
is this technologies went back
all the way to World War II.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And do you think
that people will

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:84%
be able to accept
extraterrestrial technology

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.510 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials?

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.677 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: I think this day
and age, a lot of people

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:00.807 align:middle line:90%
are wanting that to happen.

00:28:00.807 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:90%
I think that's part of it.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.848 align:middle line:84%
People don't want to be
stuck in the same world

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:90%
that we're currently in.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that we break
free from those chains is

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
through consciousness and
consciousness-assisted

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:90%
technologies--

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:90%
associated technologies.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.812 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So I'm hearing
from you disclosure

00:28:14.812 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:90%
is not just with the UAPs.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:84%
There are so many other
medical devices and aerospace,

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a plethora
of different things.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: And I'll
put it this way,

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:84%
anything that you
can think of that

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
would make your life
better is what would

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:90%
happen in a perfect world.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
take some time.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
prolonging people's lifespans

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
without having to induce
any kind of chemicals.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about harmonic
frequencies that help the body.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And water is a good
conduit of energy.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows this.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you're able to program
that water, that purified water,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and have it work for you
instead of against you,

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
which is what the carcinogens
and the water system and supply

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and the fluoride, this is
doing the exact opposite,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:90%
but in a better sense.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you do
believe that they'll

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:84%
accept the extraterrestrial
technology,

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:84%
but do you believe they'll
accept the extraterrestrial life

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
form face to face when they
actually see these life forms?

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Now, if people can
put their personal beliefs

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:84%
aside, and I'm talking
about religious--

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.078 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of the
confusion with this.

00:29:17.078 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of people
don't understand

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
is religion is talking
about extraterrestrials

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:90%
or non-human intelligence.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So if they are talking
about non-human intelligence

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:84%
in ancient scriptures,
then, yes, I

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
think subconsciously people
may be prepared for that,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:84%
but the reality
is still a shock.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The scriptures
and all the artifacts

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.022 align:middle line:84%
that are out there show that
they were working together.

00:29:42.022 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:84%
It didn't-- they didn't show
war is what I'm getting.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.355 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: No, they didn't.

00:29:45.355 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because
we look at ourselves

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and human race these days is
more driven on an ego aspect.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:84%
That's where status
comes into that.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: They had that back
then or ancient civilizations,

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:84%
but guess what helped
them with that?

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
People were more along the
lines of more being enlightened,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:84%
which is the way
that they had status.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Like the Messiah, for
example, Jesus, for example,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.508 align:middle line:84%
all the figures are related
to that, they were people

00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:90%
with higher consciousness.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we're plugged into that
sense of everybody benefiting

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:84%
from a consciousness-associated
technology to help further

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, we will all
be on that level, which--

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and again, would
mitigate status.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:middle line:84%
A hierarchy system
is basically what

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:84%
keeps people from the top
down enslaved, if you will.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Corporations do this.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Military does this.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Government does this.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Welcome
to planet Earth.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.662 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
system is off of.

00:30:35.662 --> 00:30:38.452 align:middle line:84%
So I really don't think
these ancient civilizations

00:30:38.452 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:84%
they had something
similar to that,

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.810 align:middle line:84%
but it was mainly
off of enlightenment

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and it was also helping people.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Granted, they did
some barbaric things

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that people know
about back then,

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.080 align:middle line:84%
but the civilizations that had
helped from this technology.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Because you look at the
artifacts that they've built.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any technology
as far as a modern day human,

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not talking about
these deep black programs that

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:84%
have access to this stuff
to move gigantic things.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's theories
about this, but we all--

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:84%
you know as well as I do that
that was not help from just

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
1,000 years of slaves.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
This was done over
a period of time

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:90%
that was much faster than that.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had help from
devices that are anti-gravitic

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:84%
or things that actually help
on a consciousness level

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to get people to be
healthier and stronger.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you think
about post-disclosure?

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.362 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to manage
the UAP, UFO concerns?

00:31:30.362 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: That is
a good question,

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's something that people
need to start thinking about.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
already have people

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
who are in these deep black
programs that are managing

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
this stuff and
they know it better

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.840 align:middle line:84%
than the conventional
government,

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:84%
if you were to basically
say, hey, I mean,

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:90%
how do we think about this?

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's say if we were
to take an F-22 Raptor

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and have it sent back
to the Roman times

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and give it to
them to think about

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.478 align:middle line:84%
and how to turn it
on, for example,

00:31:54.478 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
a problem doing that.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.103 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:31:57.103 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So it's the
same kind of concept

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.257 align:middle line:84%
with this technology going to
conventional sides of things

00:32:02.257 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:90%
with the government.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.290 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
know what to do with it.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.463 align:middle line:84%
So you still need the
help from these people.

00:32:06.463 --> 00:32:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question
is, is if you're

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.260 align:middle line:84%
going to take better
care of these people

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:84%
than what these black
programs are going to do.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.940 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to
rely on a system of morality,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.160 align:middle line:84%
for example, as
opposed to having money

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
because we know that
taxpayer money is

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.012 align:middle line:90%
what funds the government.

00:32:19.012 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And it should be funding the
right stuff of government, not

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the other dark stuff
that's going on.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So if they're able to help
these people out and have them

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:84%
put in these programs
with oversight,

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.362 align:middle line:84%
with this technology, that
is the only way that this

00:32:30.362 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
is going to mitigate it from
being swept back under the rug

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and classify it as a deep black
program that doesn't exist.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we keep
that from happening.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:41.113 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let me throw in there
something, a little juggernaut.

00:32:41.113 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a fourth
entity, I think,

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that might be involved
with this management.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.960 align:middle line:90%
What if I would tell you AI?

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yeah.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.540 align:middle line:90%
That's already been utilized.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.780 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And that's dangerous.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:54.947 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Yes, it is.

00:32:54.947 --> 00:32:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But what people are not
talking about-- and granted,

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:90%
this is just a theory of mine.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: The theory is you
have disclosure coming up

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.510 align:middle line:84%
In every headway of
disclosure is happening,

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:90%
AI is doing the same thing.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.130 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
come to a crossroads

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:84%
where everything
basically you have

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
an AI, a robot for the matter
that is able to be aware,

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that is able to be
on its own thinking.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to
ask this AI, hey,

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about disclosure.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.200 align:middle line:84%
What do you think that
AI is going to do?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.690 align:middle line:84%
That AI is going to pull all
the data throughout the years.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.110 align:middle line:84%
It's going to compile
it into a report that

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.448 align:middle line:84%
is going to prove disclosures
already happened, for one.

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But two, it's going to prove
the existence of a lot of things

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.352 align:middle line:90%
based off of articulate data.

00:33:42.352 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people are
not thinking about that.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I love it.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: Now, the problem
is any of the bad guys.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you were
to mitigate that,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:84%
you had to have jumped
on that a year ago.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We're talking about
disclosure, UFOs, UAPs.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
possibility or anything

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:84%
that you heard of
that the ETs could

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.068 align:middle line:90%
be in control of disclosure?

00:34:04.068 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: As far as
non-human intelligence

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.350 align:middle line:84%
goes-- this is a very
good question, by the way.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:84%
There are instances I
know of as far as crash

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
retrieval operations
that have happened

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.989 align:middle line:84%
where they have obtained craft
without any biologics on board.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question goes, was
that something deliberate

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
as they sent a craft to our
atmosphere and into our planet

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.739 align:middle line:84%
so we could recover that
and kind of benefit off

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:27.802 align:middle line:90%
that technology?

00:34:27.802 --> 00:34:28.719 align:middle line:90%
That's always a thing.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.199 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're thinking
about a race of beings that

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
are very hyper-intelligent
and a level of consciousness

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.156 align:middle line:84%
that we barely even
understand as humans,

00:34:37.156 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:84%
if they're the ones
that are basically

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:42.657 align:middle line:84%
the gatekeepers for
any human race people,

00:34:42.657 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
government, whether it's

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:84%
a part of these
operations that are done

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
on the deep black
level, they're the ones

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that are able to decide
what they send to us

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.281 align:middle line:84%
or what they're able to
expose themselves of us.

00:34:54.281 --> 00:34:55.489 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a good point.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: So they're
at that point.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I think it's almost like--

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my personal
example is this.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.188 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these guys
that I work with that

00:35:05.188 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:84%
are a part of this deep
black organization,

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.200 align:middle line:84%
they don't tell me everything
like a fire hose of knowledge.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:84%
They slowly leak
information to me

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as experiences so
I fully understand and get

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:84%
the grasp of it
because what they

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.820 align:middle line:84%
have to provide is a
lot of information,

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:84%
but what they want is to
basically sift and chew

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
through that information
to where I can benefit

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:84%
by understanding it fully
instead of just having

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.570 align:middle line:84%
partial knowledge of it,
if that makes any sense.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It makes total sense.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many retrievals in
the past that I've been on

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and documented retrievals
do show the craft

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and also more like clones or
programmed life forms in there

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.400 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of other
robotic kind of device.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And we both know if they
didn't want to get shot down,

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:90%
they probably wouldn't want.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it is a
little package for us

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that they're guiding us for
technology and their own agenda.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HERRERA: Correct.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
instances where

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:84%
these crash retrieval of
non-human intelligence

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and biologics, they don't
have any digestive systems.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So it puts the point of maybe
these are some sort of machinery

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know about, such
as programmed life forms being

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:84%
manufactured to an
extent and not born,

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.900 align:middle line:84%
but they have materials
that they harvest off

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:84%
of other life forms that
are able to grow this.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're doing
the same fashion

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and just putting these beings
into a craft that look ET to us,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:31.330 align:middle line:84%
but they're actually very
advanced drones into these craft

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:90%
that are crashing.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:84%
That's very probable and
that may be going on.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And there may be a
mixture of actual beings.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think when crash
retrieval started

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.240 align:middle line:84%
happening more on
a regular basis,

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:90%
whether they were actually--

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.998 align:middle line:84%
actually may have
malfunctioned, maybe there's

00:36:45.998 --> 00:36:47.540 align:middle line:84%
something that
happened to the beings

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:84%
on board that caused
them to crash, more

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.607 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of also the
targeted aspect with P3s luring

00:36:53.607 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:84%
these craft in and
then targeting them

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
with these scalar
longitudinal weapons.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:84%
There is a possibility that
it could have over the time

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:84%
has mitigated to having actual
sentient beings on board

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to actually having these
very advanced beings that

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:84%
are just robotic for that sense
that are on board instead.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking about
non-human intelligence filtering

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and controlling that information
I think it's very possible.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They're not wanting
the human race to--

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:84%
they want to slowly leak
proof, maybe it's sightings,

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's material,
maybe it's biologics.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're slowly
revealing that over time

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:84%
so we as a human race understand
what we're getting into.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.442 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, think
about it this way.

00:37:34.442 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:84%
They're controlling
our information

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
by giving us the
assets to do so.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So they want people to
understand that, OK,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:84%
if our life is going to be
impacted, such as the existence

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:84%
of non-human intelligence,
which already exists, but as

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
far as the acknowledgment
and the benefit of having

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that technology, it
is changing our world.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And it could change
our world so fast

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to where there are
certain aspects that we

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.212 align:middle line:90%
may overlook to an extent.

00:37:59.212 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So they want to make
sure that disclosure

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is going in the right
approach and us not--

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.100 align:middle line:84%
us leaving no stone unturned,
if that makes sense,

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I think is very probable.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fascinating stuff.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Michael.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.485 align:middle line:84%
Michael, I want to thank
you for being on the show.

00:38:13.485 --> 00:38:15.235 align:middle line:84%
>>HERRERA: It's a
blast, as always, Emery.

00:38:15.235 --> 00:38:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
