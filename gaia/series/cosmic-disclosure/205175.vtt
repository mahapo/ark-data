>>EMERY SMITH: Today,
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:10%
we're with Ricardo Gonzales, a
Peruvian author and researcher

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:10%
who has experienced
multiple direct contacts

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:10%
with an extraterrestrial
species called the Apunians.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking
about alien agendas.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ: Thank you.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: According to your
contact with the Apunians,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
why is Earth so
important to them?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GONZALEZ: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.262 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: According
to the experiences

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
that I've had with
these beings, the Earth

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
is important for
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
who visit us because it is
a world school, a planet

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
laboratory, a place of learning,
a planet that, in fact, is

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:84%
involved, connected
to ancient stories

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial origins.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is their role
in the relationship to Earth

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.578 align:middle line:90%
and humanity?

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: All
experience in our world,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
according to these beings,
is also related to them.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything that human beings
can learn on this planet

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
has an effect on
cosmic knowledge.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Allow me to give you an example.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They say that a child
in this universe

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:84%
has three main levels
of consciousness.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Once it achieves individual
consciousness, consciousness

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
within itself as
a human being, it

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
acquires consciousness
of the Earth,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:90%
of the planet where it lives.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It represents a
conscious being who

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:84%
lives in harmony with its
planet and with the resources

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
the planet offers them, and
so that consciousness should

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
be reflected in the being's
behavior with the planet

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and how it administers
its resources.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It is what the ancient Peruvian
people called the consciousness

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Pachamama, as
I mentioned before,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
of Mother Earth.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Then there is a second
level of consciousness,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
solar consciousness, when the
child not only has knowledge,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
contact, and balance
with its planet,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
but it also links
that consciousness

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
with the star that maintains
balance in its solar system.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
The sun represents radiating
knowledge, sharing.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
This solar
consciousness was spoken

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
of in some way by the
Egyptians, and also, the Incas,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and of course, many other
cultures of the world.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Our solar system
only has one star

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
because Jupiter did not
transform into the star

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:90%
that it was supposed to become.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Usually, solar systems in
space are binary or trinary.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
have two or three suns.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But like I said,
we only have one,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:90%
a star that is a yellow dwarf.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And that solar
consciousness also

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
connecting to the resources

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:90%
and the energy of the sun.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Once a human child has
consciousness of itself,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, and of its
connection to the sun,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
it moves to the next state,
which is much more elevated,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to a galactic consciousness,
where it can connect

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:90%
to the nucleus of its galaxy.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
According to our scientists,
in the heart of the galaxies,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
there are powerful
singularities.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
These singularities could
be supermassive black holes

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
where even light can't escape.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Or the galactic
consciousness takes humans

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
on a trip farther than the
nucleus of the Milky Way.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.738 align:middle line:10%
This concept that the
extraterrestrials hold

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:10%
is not very different
to the one that

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:10%
was made known in the 1960s,
the Soviet astrophysicist

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:10%
Kardashev or Kardashev,
when he talked

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:10%
about the types of
civilizations according

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:10%
to their use of
energy resources.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But the Kardashev scale,
as it's known today,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
which scientists
use to measure what

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
type of extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
may exist theoretically,
is different

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
because the
extraterrestrials speak

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
more about a civilization's
consciousness

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:90%
than its resources.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words, so in order to
become a type III civilization

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
on the Kardashev scale, which
would be an extra planetary

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:84%
civilization able to
travel in the solar system

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and use resources
beyond Earth, you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
need to reach the three
levels of consciousness

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that the
extraterrestrials suggest.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
operating in our reality

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:84%
are type III or type
IV civilizations,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and we humans currently are
just aspiring to be a type I

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
That is why it's
important to understand

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrial agenda.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Because in our own world,
we cannot have direct

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.115 align:middle line:84%
interventions that may
impede our own learning.

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
A little help may be given,
or some sort of intervention

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.498 align:middle line:84%
by these beings, but they can't
do the work for us, obviously.

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
In the past, when
they have attempted

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate
processes on Earth,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
even involving themselves
in our genetic development,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:84%
affecting or intervening in
important times in our history,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:90%
they have made mistakes.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So they decided that
our civilization

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
needs to walk alone,
but be watched over.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:84%
That is our role on the planet,
to learn to love and care

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
for it, to develop ourselves
in harmony here, and transform

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
ourselves into a type I
or a type II civilization

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:90%
gradually through consciousness.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Beautiful, Ricardo.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Are the Apunians part of
any galactic federation

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
or parliament that
you're aware of?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Of course,
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:90%
are organized.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for decades
in contactism,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
the term galactic
federation has been

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
used to describe this
extraterrestrial organization

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrial
civilizations,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
but I understand that it is a
term that is often rejected.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
As a result of science
fiction TV series,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
such as "Star Trek,"
or strident statements

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
in the media about a
federation of galactic worlds,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:90%
it sounds very strange.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
"Star Trek" would be
an example of this.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
There, they used the
term Galactic Federation.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So people say, oh,
that's not real.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I saw that on "Star Trek," but
the reality precedes fiction.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
"Star Trek" also
showed us technology

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
not in existence at
that time, for example,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
touch screens or devices
similar to USB pen drives,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
or even holograms, which
nowadays is a reality.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I will digress in
order to explain

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that not everything you see
in science fiction is fiction.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So that Galactic
Federation that appears

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
on "Star Trek" in
reality exists, perhaps

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
with other names or
other characteristics

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
far from human
imagination, but there is

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
an organized group of
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
operating jointly, and
in that organized group

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is the civilization
of Alpha Centauri,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
also known as the Apunians.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
There are different groups of
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:90%
with different agendas.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It's clear to me that
the beings we have met--

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and I say this from
experience, my perception

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:90%
from decades of contact.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:90%
Their intentions are positive.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:90%
They are fraternal.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
It's as if they were part of
an anthropological mission that

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
is trying to learn from us
and warn us of some dangers

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to our species.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they have referred to
some of their ancient visits

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to our planet, and
when we research them

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
in our legends, our
myths, our history,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
we've seen that
they are positive.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
However, there's
also another story.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
There are also myths and
legends and traditions

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that talk about
other civilizations

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
from the heavens
that appeared not

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to have such friendly
intentions with humanity,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
or who had a skeptical
point of view

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:90%
of our evolutionary development.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked the
beings who contact me

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
about these hostile behaviors
of extraterrestrials

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
toward humanity, they have
told me that, in fact, this

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
has happened.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:84%
From what I said before,
there are different agendas.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Beings who believe in us and
that our development will

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
positively affect
these beings, who

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
believe that the human race
will become some type of vaccine

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:84%
for a virus that stagnates
the universe's evolution--

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Or are we the virus?

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Exactly, Emery,
or that we are the virus.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's do an exercise.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine that we are
extraterrestrial beings,

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and we are now debating about
a species on a blue planet,

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
humanity, and you
show me images taken

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
from the history of that
humanity in which you can see

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:84%
how we damage the planet,
the way in which we exploit

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
the resources, our wars, our
inequality, our conspiracies,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and you tell me, this
species is dangerous.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And for my opinion, I
respond, there are also

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
scenes of love and
compassion, that they

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
have overcome pain, pushed
forward, and survived, where

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:84%
interesting beings have emerged,
like Mother Teresa, or Gandhi,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:84%
or Buddha, or Jesus,
or great world masters.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
In the universe,
two positions were

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
developed, one that is prudent
and skeptical of humans, which

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
as humans, we interpret as dark
and fearful, wanting to destroy

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
us, because one thing is
how humans perceive things

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and another is how
the universe works,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and the other position,
which believes in us

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:90%
and has faith in us.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're in
the middle of a chess game

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:84%
where if humanity demonstrates
that it can shift its destiny

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and become a conscious
civilization,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:84%
we would positively
affect the realities

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:84%
of those civilizations
who preceded us.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You spoke about the
Apunians and their interaction

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you know about any other
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.225 align:middle line:84%
that are interacting with us
now and what's their agenda?

00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Up
until now, I've

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
been referring to
a global agenda

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial beings where
the Apunian segment is only

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:90%
a part of this movie.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
The beings that we
have met in Peru

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:84%
obviously have an agenda within
a bigger agenda, an agenda that

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
is obviously positive,
fraternal, respectful,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and like I said, part of a
bigger plan, if you will.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But within the great matrix of
these extraterrestrial agendas,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I understand that, indeed,
there are other civilizations

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
with their own agendas and
objectives to come to Earth

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:90%
and be among us.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
are some groups

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
anthropologists

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
who have attempted to stimulate
and impact with a message,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
with information witnesses
who are highly credible,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
such as important scientists,
military high command.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I think very well what
I'm talking about.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, these
witnesses do not always

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
dare to speak in public
about these contacts.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why there
is another segment

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:84%
of this group of
extraterrestrial

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
anthropologists who have made
contact with what we call

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:90%
groups with wide diffusion.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:84%
These groups with wide
diffusion have the goal

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
of following their
contact experiences,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
making them be known,
disseminate them, disclose

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
are extraterrestrial

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
anthropological missions who
attempt to contact humans

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
with highly credible witnesses
and regular witnesses

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
so that they will widely
disseminate their testimonies.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But there are also other
extraterrestrial missions

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
on these agendas,
but their plans

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
don't even contemplate
contact with humans, zero.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:90%
They're basically scientists.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
They are not seen and
they work in silence.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
They research our
oceans, our lakes.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
They are very
interested in water.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
They say that the Earth's
water is very special,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that it's the element that
links the lives of all

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
the creatures with
physical appearance

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in all this region
of the universe.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
It is an element that was
formed thanks to the stars.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
When the first stars
exploded creating a marvelous

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
mixture in the cosmos, which was
the origin of what we call H2O,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
the formula for
water, that's why

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
we will find many different
types of this element

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But the extraterrestrials say
that the water here on Earth

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:90%
is very special.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They're researching it.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They research how the
mechanism works, the nature

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:90%
of these portals on our planet.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And they also use these
networks of dimensional portals

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
their home worlds.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think that other
extraterrestrials out there

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
have any alliances or
contracts with the United

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
States or other governments
here on planet Earth?

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: This is a
very complicated and delicate

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:90%
question, Emery.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm unable to answer
with a resounding yes,

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
nor am I able to answer
with a resounding no.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you what these
beings have transmitted

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
to me when I've seen them
and we've had contact

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked them
about these subjects.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
First of all, yes,
they have had contact

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
with military high commands
and important scientists

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
and in the Soviet Union

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:90%
during the Cold War.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
They also had contact with
some important officials

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
of the former Soviet Union
and other countries as well.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
From what I understood from
Antarel's story, the being who

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
has been in contact
with me, it was

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:84%
more of a diplomatic
contact, a first approach,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
an attempt at formal
communication.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
That has happened, and
it has been attempted

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
in even more recent
times, but these links

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
or these communications
have actually not prospered.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm referring
to those beings

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:84%
with human appearance who
have fraternal agendas

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and headed up these
anthropological missions.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I
should say, always

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
based on my own source of
contact, on my information,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
but that rumor that spread
throughout US ufology

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
where it was said that
an alliance was forged

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
between the US military
and unpleasant-looking

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials of
small physical stature,

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
saying something like,
you give us technology

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and we will open up the planet
to use so that you can do

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:84%
your abductions and
experiments, this

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is not like an alliance between
an Argentine and an Arab.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about type
III or type IV civilizations

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:90%
who are acting in our reality.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And if they intend to come and
take people and do research

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and if they
don't have an amicable agenda,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to ask
for anyone's permission.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
They have the technology, the
knowledge to do as they please.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Besides, if these beings
really did their homework,

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
if they really
studied our history,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
they know that we humans don't
follow treaties too closely.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And if we haven't kept our own
treaties, and we've had wars,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
do they think we're
going to have alliances

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.260 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials?

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.690 align:middle line:84%
What I think has
happened is another issue

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
which explains some reliable
military testimonies

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
in military complexes.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
There have been crashes
of non-human objects

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, and in
some of these accidents

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
of non-human ships, some
extraterrestrial beings

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:90%
have survived.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And according to
some testimonies,

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:84%
these are some of the
beings that have been

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:90%
seen in military complexes.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
the military has ever

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.675 align:middle line:84%
shot down an extraterrestrial
vehicle on purpose?

00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: In
reality, the majority

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
crashes on our planet

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:90%
were not due to human causes.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:90%
So what happened then?

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I asked the beings who
contact me, what's the answer?

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:90%
How can this be explained?

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Was there some type of
navigational failure

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:90%
on their ship causing the crash?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Was it an accident?

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And they answered, there was
an external factor, not human.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a confrontation
with other beings.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that what I'm
saying sounds crazy,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
but they explained
this story to me

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
that is within these
extraterrestrial agendas.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:84%
As we said, there's an
extraterrestrial group

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:90%
with fraternal intentions.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Human learning and development
on Earth is important.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:84%
And it was that group of
fraternal extraterrestrial

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:84%
civilizations who established
a type of quarantine

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:90%
to protect the planet.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
This quarantine was much
stricter in the 1940s.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Ever since we
started to experiment

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
with dimensional portals
and we split the atom,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
we sent a dangerous
signal to the universe.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And creatures that are very
scientific, we could say,

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
very cold, very rational,
came to Earth to see what

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
was happening with the human
race that was experimenting

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:90%
with dangerous things.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So we had shown ourselves,
introduced ourselves

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to the universe with a
terrible calling card.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So the creatures that started
approaching the planet more

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
were coming with that idea of
those intentions, if you will.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:84%
They're not creatures that
have had a great deal of ethics

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:90%
or emotions.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm describing
that in human terms.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So when they manifested
themselves in our reality

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
quarantine established

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:84%
by the fraternal
extraterrestrial organization,

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
there were clashes,
there were battles.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the ships that
have crashed on our planet

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:84%
are the ships that have
been shot down by those who

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:90%
protect us and take care of us.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
One pattern with all
of the ships that

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
have crashed in our world is
that in the majority of cases,

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
they're the same
type of creatures,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
small creatures with quite a
large face, a very large head,

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
with large, very dark eyes, and
they don't have a belly button.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:90%
They're like biological robots.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there is a war going
on between extraterrestrials,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and these craft that
have crashed into Earth

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
have been shot down by good
or bad extraterrestrials?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the ships that have
been shot down on our planet

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:84%
have been shot down by other
extraterrestrial beings,

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
but by those who protect us,
those who take care of us

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:90%
with this quarantine.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But this quarantine that was
implemented a long time ago

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
in our world was so
that we would not

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
have major interventions from
other extraterrestrial beings

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
on our planet so
that we may culminate

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
our process through our
own merit as a species.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
This quarantine has
other purposes as well.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It was not only made so
that something couldn't come

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:84%
in and hurt us, but it's also
made so that we cannot leave.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Many people ask
me, well, if this

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
is the case, what
about what you talked

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
about in other interviews about
the trip to Alpha Centauri,

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:84%
because if a human mission
travels in the future

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
to Alpha Centauri, they have
to leave the solar system

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:90%
and travel 4 light years.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
What the extraterrestrials
say is that everything

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to change with a
scientific discovery, when

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
humanity discovers
the Minius, this issue

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
of the divine particle, the
particle of God, the Minius,

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
is a big part of the
extraterrestrial agenda.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Then the quarantine
will cease to exist

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:90%
because we will break protocol.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Our scientific finding
will make us grow suddenly.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
We will not need
to be watched over.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The heavens will be open
for anyone to go in or out.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why some scientific
findings are dangerous until we

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:84%
as a species are already
through consciousness.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When we do
get to this particle,

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:84%
will we be at the right
consciousness level to travel?

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
If we discover this particle
before nothing, this holy grail

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
of physics, through
consciousness,

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
a new universe will
open up for us.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It will allow us to
understand everything

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking about
in these interviews, Emery,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
the dimension of portals,
the tissue of creation,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:84%
why we exist, why
we chose the Earth.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk about
extraterrestrial contact

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.282 align:middle line:84%
and technology, we're really
just scratching the surface.

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You speak
of the particle.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how did we
receive this information?

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we're obviously
not that smart enough to

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.600 align:middle line:90%
do it ourselves.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: The answer
is also very complex, Emery.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this race to find
the particle before nothing

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
is not just intuition
of human science.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.810 align:middle line:84%
There are also leaks from
extraterrestrial entities

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:90%
so that we may find it.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I feel quite some
strange talking

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:90%
about this on television.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's hard
for me to discern

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:84%
what I should say publicly
and what I shouldn't,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
not because it's a secret,
but because of the seriousness

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:90%
of the subject, no?

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think the time
has come to tell all,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and in time, things
will fall into place.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the
extraterrestrial leaks

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
did not have good intentions,
because to accelerate

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:84%
our discovery of the
particle before it's time is

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:90%
dangerous for us.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It is a way of
sabotaging our process

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and a way of breaking the
protocol of the quarantine.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials of the
alliance, as I call them,

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean those with
friendly intentions,

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
they attempt to
bring consciousness

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to the meaning of
this scientific race

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
to find that
particle, the Minius.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I traveled to CERN in
Switzerland to research

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:90%
the particle accelerator.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And without going into
detail, because I can't, I

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
spoke to a CERN official who
disclosed to me that, indeed,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
they have made findings
about other worlds,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional
realities that have not

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:90%
been published or disclosed.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
search for the Minius

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
is being done through
big hadron colliders.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I will say
that I was also told there

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
by this source at CERN that
the accelerators will not only

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
be placed in the United States,
in Europe, or in first world

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.690 align:middle line:84%
countries, as they're known,
but there's also a big project

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to establish one in the
Atacama Desert in Chile.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of any
extraterrestrial alliances

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:90%
with the cabal?

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And if so, are
there also alliances

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.613 align:middle line:84%
that are supporting the cabal
or maybe fighting the cabal?

00:23:39.613 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: The
situation that you bring up

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:90%
varies quite a bit, Emery.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
There really aren't specific
alliances between humanity

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
beings due to the reasons

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that I explained
a few minutes ago.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:84%
What does exist are
influences, which

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
is something very different.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Today, many
researchers are talking

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
about a secret
government or a cabal

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
or a great human
conspiracy on Earth.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
These conspiracy theories
lay responsibility

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
on this cabal or the deep state
for everything that happens

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:90%
in our world in geopolitics.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
What I can tell you is that
there are many distortions

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and exaggerations in this
information that's circulating,

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:84%
but behind all that fog,
there is some truth.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a power
behind the power.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who
research UFO phenomena

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and have lived
contact experiences

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
know that when attempts have
been made to hide evidence,

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
tamper with
witnesses, misinform.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:84%
This is why I have no doubt
that non-human entities

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
origin that have

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
skeptical intentions
for human beings,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
they try to push, influence,
and act upon these groups that

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
are in power, the power
that is behind the power.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do we know who's
influencing who for the greater

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.897 align:middle line:90%
good of humanity and the Earth?

00:25:04.897 --> 00:25:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: I think that the
great masters in human history

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:90%
taught this perfectly.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
A tree is known for its fruits,
and all non-human influence

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that is in contact
with us doesn't

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:84%
have to destroy your
life, nor should it

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
lead you to do things
that you don't want to do.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing for a
person who has had contact

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to go through a crisis because
the experience was so intense.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
All contact witnesses
have gone through that.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking
about something else.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a
sustained influence that

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
leads you to be
disruptive to yourself

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and to others, that pushes
you or forces you to do things

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want to do.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.390 align:middle line:84%
If you plant apples, you
cannot harvest bananas.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:84%
With the experiences,
with the results,

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.240 align:middle line:84%
you realize what you are
hearing, what phenomena

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:90%
you are living through.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
extraterrestrials' role

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:84%
in evolving human life, number
one, and was life on Earth

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
created or influenced
by advanced beings?

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: As we can
see, extraterrestrials' role

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:84%
has been very close
to the human race,

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
because all of these contacts
and all of these groups

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are analyzing
have not just

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
been involved very recently,
but from the very beginning

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, since before
we human beings were here.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:84%
This makes us delve
quite deep into some

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
information,

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.850 align:middle line:84%
into this great agenda or great
plan that they are part of.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:84%
They say that first,
the planet was chosen.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a type of
experiment where

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
a new species could achieve
new horizons of evolution.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
It had to be a planet located
in a solar system that

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
had only one star, according
to these beings' protocols.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
They call them planets
with blue aura.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And our world is a planet with
a blue aura with only one star.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.040 align:middle line:84%
According to this
extraterrestrial concept,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:84%
it is a laboratory world
with a great potential

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
for diverse life.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So with their technology,
they helped nature to prosper.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, they
may have influenced

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:32.250 align:middle line:84%
the oceans that were acidic to
quickly become more alkaline,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and plant in them
patterns of life

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.920 align:middle line:84%
that later would drive
into the types of life that

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:90%
now lives on our planet.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists have
considered that life maybe

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.935 align:middle line:84%
came from space or a comet or
an asteroid that impacted us,

00:27:47.935 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:84%
planting life here on
Earth hundreds of millions

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
What if beings from
other worlds truly

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who carefully
planted that seed on Earth

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:90%
for life to emerge here?

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
This would mean
that maybe we humans

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
might be their descendants,
descendants from some action

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that they fostered long ago, and
also descendants in the sense

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
that there was intermixing
of our ancestors

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
of human appearance.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, the role
of these beings with us

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:84%
is not recent, but has
been since the beginning.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is their
current agenda, then?

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: In our time,
obviously, this agenda

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:84%
has evolved, this
plan for our planet.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is no longer a piece
of the sun in the cooling

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The dinosaurs became extinct
65 million years ago.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:84%
We humans have only been here
on Earth a few million years,

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and our civilization,
according to the most

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
orthodox archeologists
and historians,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:84%
only began in Mesopotamia
6,000 or 7,000 years ago.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're right
here in the 21st century,

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
trying to colonize Mars,
to go back to the Moon.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So what is the current
stage of this plan?

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
To see how human beings have
developed in this blue world,

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
is growing in the face of
challenges and difficulties

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
in a phase in which
it can use technology

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and how it will utilize it
in this new opportunity?

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And why do I say
a new opportunity?

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Because according to these
extraterrestrial beings,

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:84%
there were other human
civilizations like us

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that went extinct
thousands of years

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:84%
ago that we don't have much
knowledge about, according

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to our archeology and history,
are just legends that didn't

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:84%
exist because for now,
there's no concrete proof

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
that they existed.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But they were human
civilizations with advanced

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and technology
and they disappeared

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
because that technology
was put to ill use,

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and following the catastrophe
that happened on the planet,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:90%
it had to start from zero.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
human beings have
historical amnesia

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and we can only trace
our civilization

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:90%
back a few thousand years.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:84%
They say that we
cannot fail again.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have the Apunians
shared with you anything

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:90%
about the upcoming future?

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: These beings have
talked to us about many things,

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
about the different
possibilities

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:90%
in what we call future.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.080 align:middle line:84%
They told us that
humanity was going

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to face a series of
difficult processes

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:84%
at this time, where we would
face climate changes that would

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:84%
be more intense with time,
wars in places that have

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:47.250 align:middle line:84%
important energy interests
for major powers, plagues

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and diseases and attempting
to successfully overcome them.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
Stephen Hawking,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
the important scientist
from Cambridge,

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:84%
when he spoke of the need
to explore Alpha Centauri,

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
after we talked about our
contact and the message

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that everyone knows
about, Hawking

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:84%
concurred with the
extraterrestrials

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:84%
in saying that a pandemic,
climate change, or impact

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:84%
from an asteroid would
force us to flee Earth.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Impacts from an asteroid.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that we humans

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.520 align:middle line:84%
say when we hear
things like this

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:90%
is, this won't happen to us.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.230 align:middle line:84%
When we speak of Spanish
flu, which happened long ago

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and killed close to
60 million people,

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
about 1918, and when

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you analyze those circumstances
that happened on the planet,

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
they seem so long ago and that
they could not happen again,

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.423 align:middle line:90%
like an unimaginable story.

00:31:40.423 --> 00:31:41.590 align:middle line:90%
That couldn't have happened.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:90%
It won't happen again.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:84%
This generation is
living through it now.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with fewer
deaths than with what

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:84%
we call the Spanish flu, but
a good portion of the world

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.990 align:middle line:84%
shut down, full
of fear and worry,

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.710 align:middle line:84%
the economy being destroyed
in this global world,

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and has taken us time to face
this pandemic or whatever.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.910 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
we add major climate

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.500 align:middle line:84%
change to this, that would
affect our resources, our food?

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:84%
All these things
are happening now.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrials
that are in contact

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
with us had already warned
us that between 2020 and 2027

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:84%
were going to be key
years for our species,

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.170 align:middle line:84%
almost like a trial,
like a final test

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:84%
to see how we would react if
we're able to survive in peace,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.770 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, and
build a better future.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So in these seven years that
we're going through right now,

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
according to the space of time
that these extraterrestrial

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:84%
beings transmitted to me so that
we may analyze ourselves, learn

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and change, this is
a great opportunity

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to transform
ourselves or to fall.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
When the Black Plague
occurred that we all

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.500 align:middle line:84%
remember from the
Middle Ages, it

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
was one of the turning
points that later brought

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:90%
an end to the Middle Ages.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And when the Middle Ages
ended, the Renaissance

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:84%
began that made Florence,
Italy this epicenter

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.410 align:middle line:90%
of new arts and human thought.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.880 align:middle line:84%
When World War I ended and the
Spanish flu that I mentioned,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:84%
we attempted to
recover from that.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We founded the League of
Nations, the predecessor

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:90%
of the United Nations.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And the famous
Roaring '20s began,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:84%
with people experimenting
with fashion, fun, dance.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:84%
You will recall this
especially here in US history.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there were also
dramatic moments, those times

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:90%
of our civilization.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But in these circumstances
that we are in now,

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
we need to have a new
time of Renaissance.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
insist that they

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:90%
see this as an opportunity.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Renaissance
was a transition

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:02.780 align:middle line:84%
between in the Middle Ages
and the modern age, right now,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.290 align:middle line:84%
these seven years have
to be the transition

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to open a new space age, a
space age that has to be based,

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:84%
as we've discussed,
Emery, on consciousness.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.300 align:middle line:84%
We should not waste
this opportunity.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:84%
There's an interesting detail
that I would like to share.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.449 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
this for many years.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.290 align:middle line:84%
It's in several documentaries
on TV, in my books.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:84%
You know that here,
in the United States,

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.330 align:middle line:84%
a countdown clock was
set up in New York

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:39.480 align:middle line:84%
City in the middle of
Manhattan, a climate clock,

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
marking the point of no return,
the deadline, the year 2027.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And they put it there
in New York City

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.170 align:middle line:90%
right in front of our nose.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:53.639 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations models also
specify the year 2025 to 2027

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:90%
for action to be taken.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.220 align:middle line:90%
If not, we're in for trouble.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in the years
of great transformation,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.890 align:middle line:90%
the great change.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have to face
it without fear,

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.110 align:middle line:90%
because fear will control you.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo,
fascinating information.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Thank
you so much, Emery.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
