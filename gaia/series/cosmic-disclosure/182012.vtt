[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Today we
have Tony Rodriguez, who

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle line:10%
claims to have entered
the Secret Space Program.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:10%
Hi, Tony.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:10%
>>TONY RODRIGUES: Hey, Jay.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So let's start
at the beginning.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Where were you living
when all of this started?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I
grew up on a farm.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
We had a 13 acre farm house
that was a 100 year old house

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
in southern Michigan,
on the southern side

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:90%
of Ypsilanti, Michigan--

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Ann Arbor.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I went to old Brick
Elementary School

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and had a normal childhood
for the most part.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I was 9 years old, I
guess, when I started.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.275 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, that's
pretty young.

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Why would they
take a 9-year-old?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: What happened was
it was fourth grade for me.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
In the third grade,
I tested really well

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:90%
on some aptitude tests.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So the school had coincidentally
just been funded that year

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
for a new program, the
talented and gifted program,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.465 align:middle line:90%
TAG for short.

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes, I know this program.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: TAG.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.372 align:middle line:90%
And so I guess it still exists.

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes, it does.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: In my third grade,
they told all the teachers

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to be on the lookout for
kids that were smart,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and so it was the
top 5% of the school,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and I ended up in there.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:84%
In fourth grade, they
sent news to my parents,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and we met every Wednesday
at 9:00 AM in the library.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And what the class was
was advanced learning--

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:90%
how to research things.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
There was no internet back
then, so it was teaching us

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:84%
how to think for ourselves,
be creative, and do

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:90%
your own research.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:90%
That was the class.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I was the
youngest of five children,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and I could hang my hat.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:90%
That was the thing that--

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:84%
the youngest kid really isn't
this oldest, or fastest,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:90%
or the prettiest, whatever.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was like I was
smart, and I was proud of that.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to that class,
I met kids that were smarter

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:90%
than me, and it hurt.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.877 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: One
of them was a kid

00:01:59.877 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:84%
who was ridiculously-- he's
tested something like 200 IQ.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
He spoke like an adult,
and he told the teacher

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:90%
how to run the class.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I was resentful that I
wasn't the smartest kid.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I was the smartest
kid at home, and that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:90%
was where I hung my hat.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So here comes this kid
that was amazingly smart

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and mature, to boot,
but a little off.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we didn't get
along, and I picked on him.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We were rivals, and
I was mean to him.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Teacher would give
us an assignment.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
We'd sit at the
couch in the library,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:90%
get books, and research.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we're sitting
there, and he says,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:90%
my dad's an Illuminati.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.117 align:middle line:90%
What's your dad do?

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said it really
condescendingly,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:90%
like my dad's an Illuminati.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:90%
What's your dad do?

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what that was.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:90%
My dad works for General Motors.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:90%
My dad's got an awesome job.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
anything of it,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
but that stood out, because
his behavior was just so far

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:84%
away from any other
behavior of anybody

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I'd ever met to that point.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So he was
really eccentric.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Very.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
His dad was in town
negotiating a contract

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
between two corporations that
were headquartered in the area.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What year was this
where you went into the school?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It was the
school year of '81 to '82.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
So his dad came later that year.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was in
April, but that's a guess.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a long time ago.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was the judge
for the science fair,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.568 align:middle line:84%
and what our teacher
for that class--

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and I won't mention
her name, but she

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:84%
said he was the most educated
man she'd ever heard of.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.963 align:middle line:84%
He had more PhDs than
she thought was possible.

00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So he was a perfect judge
for the science fair

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:90%
for our fourth grade class.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And we set up our
exhibit in the cafeteria.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.995 align:middle line:84%
I walked by him and his dad,
and he says, in earshot of me,

00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
as I walked by
him, he said, dad,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that's that boy I told you
about that ruined my confidence.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Whoa.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And then they
had a weird conversation.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:90%
They used weird words.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
He said maybe we'll send
him to one of our projects,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.763 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't think
anything of it.

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I just went on about my day.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I was a pretty cocky
kid at the time.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I think
if I would have never

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
been interrupted with
any of this I would be

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:90%
a completely different person.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Probably.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I'm really not
the most self-confident person

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.567 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:90%
So he said, we'll do that.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.715 align:middle line:84%
And he said to his dad, he
doesn't deserve any of that.

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:05.457 align:middle line:84%
And he said something
back to him.

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're going
to have to learn

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
how to manage your assets
better or something.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:90%
He said something like that.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I went on about my day,
and it was that night.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So this was a lesson to
his kid about how to be tough.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Maybe.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lesson to me, as well,
for how to not be so arrogant,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It worked.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It was that
night or a couple of nights--

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
it was very soon after that
night that I woke up with

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
a being in my face in my
bedroom in that farmhouse--

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:90%
in that house.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And I thought it was my dad.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
My dad always did pranks, and
I thought he had a mask on.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, dad, take the mask off.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the middle of the night.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And I reached up and
touched it, and it just

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
stood over me dead silent--
a gray, your typical gray.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And I touched it, and it was
cold, and wet, and very porous,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:90%
like giant pores.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And I went ah, and then as soon
as I reacted, I was paralyzed.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I could move my eyes,
but I couldn't move.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I
saw at the foot of my bed

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
two or three more
reptile looking beings.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to call them
aliens, but they were ETs.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.862 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What did they look like?

00:05:18.862 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: They had hoods on.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
They were reptiles.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:84%
They were probably
three or four feet tall.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Shorter.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They were short,
and they came in, and picked me

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
up, and carried me to
the foot of my bed.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:90%
There was a flash of light.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
going out my window,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
but there was a flash
of light, and it

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.248 align:middle line:90%
was kind of very disorienting.

00:05:35.248 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember
being on a table.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I was basically naked on a
stainless steel kind of table,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:90%
and it was a round room.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I had bad vision back then.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I've had laser surgery since.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:90%
I had very nearsightedness.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So I was in that room,
and everything was blurry

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
just because I didn't
have my glasses with me.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And they ran some tests on me.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
They hit me here,
and it was painful.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And the short reptile was
talking to me telepathically.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.547 align:middle line:90%
It was telepathic.

00:06:03.547 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we're going
to run some tests on you.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:90%
We want your help, and I was--

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was first contact.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:90%
I thought that here is our--

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:90%
ETs are finally landing.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I knew you guys were real.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.078 align:middle line:90%
Finally there are ETs.

00:06:15.078 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to prove that--

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be the kid that
was going to go home and tell

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:90%
his parents there's ETs.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we need
to borrow your--

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:84%
his exact words were we need
to borrow your consciousness.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.362 align:middle line:90%
You're going to help us.

00:06:27.362 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to help us?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:90%
And then the other said--

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.987 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you weren't
scared at all or afraid?

00:06:32.987 --> 00:06:34.112 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: You know what?

00:06:34.112 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They went out of
their way to be very--

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to hurt you.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Nothing bad is going
to happen to you.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:90%
We're going to put you back.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.520 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be fine.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.697 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid when I came
to, but they were very,

00:06:44.697 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
very-- we're not going to
do anything to hurt you.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.687 align:middle line:90%
I said, this just hurt.

00:06:49.687 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But they were very reassuring,
so I thought that I

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:90%
was in good hands at that time.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And again, I was a kid.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd never really been
in anybody's bad hands

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:90%
So I had no reason to be afraid.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we're going to
borrow your consciousness,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.857 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
be gone for 20 years.

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, I can't do that.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I have my mom, and
dad, and my family.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:90%
I have a family.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't be gone.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And he explained.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, you're going to
go right back the next day.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It'll be like you
never left, but you get

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.518 align:middle line:90%
to live with this extra time.

00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
huge blessing to you.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:90%
He had to ask.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The gray that was in the room
was a longer necked gray,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:90%
not like the one that took me.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It had a longer
neck-- taller gray.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.705 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you have to get
his permission at some point.

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
he asked me that.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.622 align:middle line:84%
We need to borrow
your consciousness.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, OK, as long as
you're sure you're telling me.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:10%
It was just like "Fire in
the Sky," the Travis Walton

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:10%
experience, where they
laid me down on a table.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, OK, we're not
going to do anything

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
that's going to hurt you.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be just fine.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And they put a latex or like a
rope thin rubber sheet over me,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:90%
and the table sucked it tight.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.548 align:middle line:90%
There was a vacuum.

00:07:57.548 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I couldn't breathe,
and I opened my mouth and went--

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.215 align:middle line:90%
and it was in--

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:90%
the vacuum had been--

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I was breathing in,
and they took a scalpel

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.825 align:middle line:90%
and cut it so I could breathe.

00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:08.392 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, hey,
I thought you said

00:08:08.392 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:90%
you weren't going to hurt me.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
And they said, you weren't hurt.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.685 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what if I
could have choked on that.

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
How did you know I
was going to breathe

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.393 align:middle line:90%
in where you could cut it?

00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
everybody does.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And then they cut
out around my eye,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:84%
which they had to do a test and
see what was my dominant eye.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And then it was a
gold needle that

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.945 align:middle line:84%
went in right by the
tear duct and went

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:90%
bam, which hurt like hell.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like I
was being sucked--

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
it felt like you know when you
get punched and you see stars?

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It was
that, but times 1,000.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew I woke
up, and I had no memory of mom,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:90%
or dad, or anywhere.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I had complete amnesia,
and I was in the desert.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The memory wiped you?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:90%
They mind wiped you?

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I had no
memory of my family.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Of your entire life?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:84%
You're nine years old, and
now you have no memories.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.903 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: That's right.

00:08:53.903 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you remember what you
learned in school and things?

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: No.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I could speak English.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You could speak.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And I
had a few memories,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
but no, I didn't have
memory of school.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have much ability.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I had no memory of where
I came from or anything.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I woke up, and there was a man,
a tall guy with Coke bottle

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:90%
glasses, curly hair.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.687 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You were in
the desert, you said?

00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I've
found it since then.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.098 align:middle line:10%
I pinned it down to
Inyokern Air Base.

00:09:23.098 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:90%
They were like portables.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: In California?

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: In Southern
California next to China Lake.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It was like old used
hospital equipment.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:90%
There was a nurse, and he said--

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
they're giving me
the reflex test.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
He gave me your standard
checkup, and he said,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
do you remember your mom or dad?

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:40.707 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:09:40.707 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you
remember your brothers

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.998 align:middle line:84%
or-- do you have any
brothers or sisters?

00:09:43.998 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, go
ahead and lay down.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:90%
I felt terrible.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I felt nauseous and terrible,
and they let me go to sleep.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.185 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning it
began your standard--

00:09:56.185 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
which I've researched
since then,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:84%
but it was your standard
MK Ultra trauma based

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:90%
mind control program.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And why would
they do this to you?

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Well, this
is the hardest part

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:90%
of the whole experience.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The whole 20 years
that I went through--

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
this is absolutely the
hardest part to recount,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:90%
because it still hurts.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
program, our behavior

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
was completely different
than what it was.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
That was the last time
that I was myself.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:90%
I was never the same after that.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
They electric shocked us, and
they made us watch movies.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So a little bit like
Stanley Kubrick's "Clockwork

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Orange."

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: A lot like it.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They were like the old
'70s motorcycle helmets,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and they had an electric current
that passed through them.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And it hurt, man.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:90%
He had a dial.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Some days he turned it
up higher than others.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:90%
And he drugged us.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It was like an LSD, some kind
of hallucinogen. I don't know.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't cover this, but
at the time, when he said,

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
do you remember
your mom and dad?

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any memories?

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.437 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's
because you're a clone.

00:10:58.437 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he thought I was.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Whether I was or
not, I don't know.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:90%
I experienced it.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I remember it.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Me right now, I'm me.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I have a birth certificate,
and I'm a normal person.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So I may have been
a clone of myself

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.603 align:middle line:84%
with my consciousness
transferred.

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So then what
happened after this?

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It
culminated-- the program

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that I was in-- they
put us in a oxygen tent

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and lowered the oxygen.
And a bell would

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
ring when you were about to
die, when your heart stopped.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They were
trying to figure out

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
if you could live in
low oxygen environments?

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Well, they brought
you really close to death,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.408 align:middle line:84%
and then once I was about
to die, the bell would ring,

00:11:36.408 --> 00:11:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and oxygen would come on.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:90%
I'd wake back up, and I'd go--

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
in those first few
moments that I had oxygen,

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.803 align:middle line:84%
and I remember-- and
that went on for hours.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it
got to the point

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:90%
where I could feel like I was--

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.712 align:middle line:84%
you know the tunnel
when you're leaving?

00:11:48.712 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:90%
It was that experience.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I got to the point where I
was going farther and farther,

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:90%
closer to death.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that I spoke, and
I said, leave this kid alone.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't me talking
as a little kid.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:90%
It was me talking like myself.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.842 align:middle line:84%
I spoke like an adult. I
said, leave this kid alone,

00:12:05.842 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to
make you regret it.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.985 align:middle line:84%
And then the nurse was there,
and they called me over

00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:90%
to the doctor.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.293 align:middle line:84%
And I made the lights
flicker or something--

00:12:11.293 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:90%
the lights in the room.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And that qualified me
to go to the next stage

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
of the program, the theta
stage of the programming.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they're actually
trying to get your higher self

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:90%
to intrude into the--

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And that's
exactly what happened, yes.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's
really interesting.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.227 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Then I
went into the theta,

00:12:27.227 --> 00:12:29.837 align:middle line:84%
and then that was only a
few weeks of remote viewing.

00:12:29.837 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So somehow
they thought now you

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:84%
were qualified to
become a remote viewer,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
so it has to be a direct
result of the trauma based

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%
mind control programming.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.672 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: What
happened was, after that,

00:12:38.672 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
we did the remote viewing tests,
and then they got to the point

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:90%
where they would give us--

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:84%
they would give me an IV
with a bag of whatever,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and then put a drug in there,
and I would lose consciousness.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up, people were
freaked out by stuff I said.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:90%
That was from probably my--

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
in my age in that
timeline with 20 back--

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
probably from my age of
12 or 13 till about 16.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened was that
he had a military guy came,

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and they gave us a
calisthenic program.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to keep us in
shape, and in the mornings,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.905 align:middle line:90%
we had a pill cup that we took.

00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we did calisthenics
out on the deck,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
or in the wintertime, we were
in the lower basement room.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Eventually one day they changed
the pills, and I was sick.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
In my real life, I'm
allergic to codeine greatly,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and so it must have been
a codeine pill in there.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.615 align:middle line:84%
The first day I got sick from
it, and by the third day,

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
as soon as I took
the pill, I was

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.595 align:middle line:90%
vomiting right then and there.

00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if you can't
get used to these new pills,

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
he's going to have to
go to the military,

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what happened.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that's when you
joined the Secret Space

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Program.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And there were
guys in a van that gave me

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:90%
an injection, and I went out.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I was not on the earth anymore.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:90%
I was taken to the moon base.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I woke up on a base.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Your standard TR3B
lower triangular

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:90%
landed on the runway.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:84%
A staircase went
up to it, and there

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:84%
was 80 people, 100
people that boarded it,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.613 align:middle line:90%
and we walked on it.

00:14:10.613 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And we sat down there.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
It was just like the
inside of an airplane,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.413 align:middle line:90%
but there were wide rows--

00:14:14.413 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:90%
20, 30 seats wide.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:90%
And we took off.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we got close to the
moon, the wall on the right

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:84%
hand side of the craft
went transparent,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot came
over the intercom,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.235 align:middle line:84%
just like in an airplane flight
when you're flying across.

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
If you look to the right,
this is the Grand Canyon.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
He did that.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:90%
He said, here is a base.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
He said something like
there is one of our bases.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:90%
If you look, you can see it.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see it
where I was sitting,

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
but when we went to the next
base where we were going,

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
my wall on my side of the
craft went transparent,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:90%
and we could see it.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:84%
He said that the Pentagon was
designed so robustly that they

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
saved money in this base by
using the same blueprints,

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.500 align:middle line:84%
but it basically looked
just like the Pentagon.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the wall went,
and we landed, and docked,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:90%
and went in.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:90%
So what happens at this point?

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I was in a room
that looked like computer labs

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:90%
on a college campus.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Big room with a pretty tall
ceiling and rows of computers.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was--
it was a gray this time

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and would give me
instructions telepathically.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the mornings,
he'd set you up,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and I got an eyedrop
that was a drug.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a station,
and you rested your head on it

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
right in front of the screen,
and then it would play movies.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
There were speakers,
and it started off

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:90%
with the binaural stuff--

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:90%
a few minutes of that--

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:90%
and then that would quit.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever
drug they'd give you

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:90%
would take more effect.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the movies would
play, and it was training,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't like--

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't being trained
to be a soldier.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
We were being trained to
be fodder for soldiers.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And what it was was a
fight or flight response.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They were movies and weird
clips of things that basically--

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.462 align:middle line:84%
and then recordings
of a man's voice

00:16:05.462 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
like the best thing you
can do for your brother

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:90%
is to give your life.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:90%
You have two choices.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You can run or you can fight,
and the greatest choice

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:90%
is to fight.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was stuff
like that that just

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:90%
played over and over for hours.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're back into a
kind of a mind control program

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Exactly.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Only this
time it's getting

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:90%
you ready for the military.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: That's
exactly what it was.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I have no
idea how long that lasted.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for a while, and
then what happened was--

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.372 align:middle line:90%
and then they did other things.

00:16:30.372 --> 00:16:32.878 align:middle line:84%
There was a machine they put
us in that moved your strength.

00:16:32.878 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
They gave you surgery,
and then there

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
is a machine that would move
me, and see my range of motion,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and test how strong I was.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: But it was
only once in a while

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that anything deviated from
those movies of training.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.823 align:middle line:84%
I never fired a weapon
or anything like that.

00:16:47.823 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were there
windows that you

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%
could see the moon or anything?

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing--

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: No.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.022 align:middle line:84%
It was a hallway to my room
and a hallway back to that.

00:16:54.022 --> 00:16:54.822 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's it.

00:16:54.822 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for quite a while?

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.405 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: A while, yeah.

00:16:57.405 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:90%
A month, a couple months.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:84%
There were drugs involved,
and people want definite stuff

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:90%
like, can you draw us a picture?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I was drugged, man.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And do you remember
what these movies were about?

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Fight
or flight response.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's it?

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
No weapons training
or anything like that?

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: No.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So this was just
merely psychological.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: When it finished,
there were only about a dozen

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:90%
We were taking a smaller craft.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
We went into a hangar,
and we were taken

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
to another base on the moon.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:90%
And we got out.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:10%
This was when your
drill sergeant

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:10%
guys were waiting for us.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Stand at attention.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And they walked us down,
and look down, just watch

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the guy in front of you,
look at nothing else,

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.625 align:middle line:90%
and walk single file.

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We walked a long
ways down a corridor,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.113 align:middle line:90%
and we took an elevator down.

00:17:46.113 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And they marched
us up to a door--

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
to a big gray door and gave us--

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:90%
I guess it was our trial run.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It was an operational
trial run, and they gave us

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:84%
a canister that looked
like a shaving cream can

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
with a red button on top the
size of maybe a small energy

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:90%
drink.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And they said, once
you walk through that--

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:90%
a drill sergeant was there.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:90%
That's how we spoke--

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.770 align:middle line:84%
very, very blunt,
very abrasively.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, once you go through
that door, those will arm.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you see anything that's
a threat to you or your friends,

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
or you or your company, you
should do the right thing

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and eliminate the threat.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:90%
That was our instructions.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:90%
He stepped off.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.333 align:middle line:84%
We stood there, and we waited
a long time, a good while.

00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We waited 30, 40 minutes
at attention right there--

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:90%
a dozen of us.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You were inside?

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: It was inside.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.118 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Or you were taken
from the ship and put into--

00:18:42.118 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It was
in a hallway, yeah.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the door
opened on its own.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:90%
They took us in.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They gave us a
medical examination

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:84%
on a hospital-- in one
big room with beds,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.590 align:middle line:90%
and we slept on them.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And then next morning we were
shipped off on another ship--

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
same one, same with
the wide rows--

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:90%
and I went to Mars.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So we flew into
orbit around Mars.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have
clearance to land.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.748 align:middle line:84%
We were in orbit, and
we got there quickly,

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't have
clearance to land.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
We stayed in orbit
for a few hours,

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot turned
off the gravity

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and said, if you guys want
to experience zero gravity,

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:90%
now's a good time.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.698 align:middle line:90%
You've got about a half hour.

00:19:18.698 --> 00:19:19.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll turn the gravity off.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
There was artificial
gravity on the ship.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was too scared, and
I regretted that always

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to
experience zero gravity,

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and that was my only chance
I really got of that.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And the other boys
on the other side

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:90%
did, and they were doing flips.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:90%
There were poles.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Every few rows of
seats had a pole

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
that you could grab
and orient yourself

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:84%
so that you were never too far
away from something to grab

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.162 align:middle line:90%
in case of zero gravity.

00:19:49.162 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So they were doing
flips and stuff.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:90%
It looked like fun.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.133 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How did the gravity
work on these ships?

00:19:55.133 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: On Ceres
I saw them install

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:90%
gravity plating everywhere.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the floors
had plating in them?

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: There
was a thick gravity--

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Electro-gravitic
plating, or?

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah,
it was powered.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:84%
There was a powered
plating that was thick,

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and it had cylinders inside
of it and a mesh over it,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.303 align:middle line:90%
and that was gravity.

00:20:12.303 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Just for
the record, you're

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
not the first one to tell me
this almost in exact detail.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Well, I was
in awe because I literally

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:90%
saw that stuff go for miles.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.778 align:middle line:90%
For miles.

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And every time they opened up--

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the mine
one day, and they

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:84%
would clear out in
the microgravity,

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:90%
and then immediately install it.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So I saw it piled
up ready to go--

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:90%
the plates.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And they all plugged in.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:84%
What boggled my mind
was the amount of energy

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:90%
that it took to plate--

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:90%
to turn on the floor--

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
to have a powered flooring
the size of a city.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
something that was just

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:84%
always impressive to me, but
again, that was on the ships,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.832 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that's what
they're using in these floors.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.707 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: On ships
I worked on later,

00:20:52.707 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:84%
there were areas in the ship
that had gravity distortions

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
because of the drive
or for whatever--

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:90%
one reason or other--

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that I would always sneak
off and try to play in.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was a place where I
would get into about 55% to 60%

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
less gravity, and I
would kind of drop.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I would be in regular gravity
and drop off, and then

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
fall into the lower
gravity, and catch myself.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That was thrilling.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: It was fun.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.410 align:middle line:84%
It was my little morning
ritual that I did,

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's what made me regret
not experiencing the zero

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.277 align:middle line:90%
G when I had the chance.

00:21:23.277 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you're in this hangar.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.735 align:middle line:90%
You've just landed on Mars.

00:21:25.735 --> 00:21:27.228 align:middle line:90%
You finally got there.

00:21:27.228 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: They immediately
shipped me and the other guys--

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.437 align:middle line:84%
they rounded us up,
and they immediately

00:21:31.437 --> 00:21:34.548 align:middle line:84%
put us on a smaller ship, and
we flew to a forward base.

00:21:34.548 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was immediate.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.617 align:middle line:90%
It was quick.

00:21:36.617 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Again, could you see
out the windows or anything?

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:39.867 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Just sky.

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And we were sat in
rows at that point.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.645 align:middle line:84%
But I immediately went
to a forward base,

00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and it was like 30
minutes later I was there.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And what it was was
an underground--

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I think it had five levels.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The top level was like an armory
area and the medical area,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and then two other levels.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the bottom
level where everybody lived,

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and they gave us a cubicle.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It was an abandoned forward
base or whatever secondary base,

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
ridiculously color

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.567 align:middle line:84%
coded with pastel,
bright pastel colors.

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It was ridiculous looking.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.628 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a kindergarten.

00:22:18.628 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything was color
coded, and there

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:84%
were lines on the wall
that would take you

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to the yellow area or
the orange area, or blue.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
cafeteria in the middle.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So it branched
off where we were,

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and they converted
cubicles-- office cubicles--

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and put beds in them, and
that's where we stayed.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get a room.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Single person to a room?

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.798 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: No, well it
was like a big office,

00:22:44.798 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
imagine, with cubicles
where 50 people could work,

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:90%
and it was empty.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And 12 of the cubicles they
just put beds in there, which--

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:90%
about 12 of us.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And we stayed
there, and we didn't

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
do anything for a few weeks,
I think, or a week or so.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:90%
And one day we were--

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:84%
what they did was they
took six of us at a time,

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and we shared a bathroom across
the hall, a public bathroom

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.825 align:middle line:90%
for showers in the morning.

00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:12.992 align:middle line:90%
And then we-- the cafeteria.

00:23:12.992 --> 00:23:14.367 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
few others, so I

00:23:14.367 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:84%
think the place was
big enough to hold

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
like 200 people or 100 to 200
people, and there were only 50.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It had been abandoned.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
They were United
States soldiers,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and there were officers
with them there and maybe

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:90%
20 soldiers, 30 soldiers.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm guessing.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
What happened was one day we
were told-- we were briefed.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
They took us and
gave us a brief,

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:90%
and then they took us up to--

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:84%
we rode the elevator
up to the top,

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and then we were given
environmental suits, which

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:84%
was a very comfortable, flexible
fabric, like a plastic fabric.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And it had a helmet
that went on,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and it had a cone that
went out, but it was open.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:84%
You could breathe the air,
but it would give you oxygen

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.180 align:middle line:84%
if it needed it, and there
was a small backpack.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you could
breathe the air on Mars?

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And I
don't know if that was

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:90%
a surgery that was given to us.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:84%
In the earlier times
when I was taken,

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I went through surgery,
after surgery, after surgery,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
they were doing to me.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.275 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So are you implying
that this base was

00:24:15.275 --> 00:24:17.918 align:middle line:84%
run by the US military since
there were Marines there?

00:24:17.918 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It was a program
run by the United States.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Absolutely.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And they made it known to me
that this is the United States,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and this is run differently
than what you're used to,

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.887 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be
doing stuff our way.

00:24:27.887 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So who conquered Mars
first, the United States?

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Did they get there?

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I don't know
about the history of it.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, we were
far away from many--

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
where we landed originally
from the bigger area that

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.990 align:middle line:90%
was more densely populated.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
What happened was they gave
us an environmental suit.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:50.080 align:middle line:84%
On the right of the
suit was a square gun.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a rail gun.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And it had the handle here,
and you could grab it.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you let
go of the handle,

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.072 align:middle line:84%
it would snap up out
of the way, but I

00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:84%
could grab it, and bring it
down, and it would arm the gun.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.242 align:middle line:84%
So it was safetied if
I let it go, and it

00:25:04.242 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:90%
was attached to my arm.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.515 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get rid of it.

00:25:06.515 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
They never gave me any time,
target practice, or anything

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.523 align:middle line:84%
And the suit we had was light,
so I was lighter on Mars.

00:25:14.523 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
When we walked out
of the door, we

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:84%
stepped out of the gravity
plating and into the--

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.375 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Really
positive buoyance??

00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:20.667 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Positive buoyance.

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:90%
So it was hard to get around.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The soldiers-- we were always
accompanied by soldiers,

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and they had a
big armor on them.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:84%
They had an armor
suit that was--

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:90%
it had camouflage.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
They had a full face, and they
had electronics you could see.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:90%
They had bigger guns.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:90%
It was impressive.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
They could run and jump the
same like they were on Earth,

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:90%
and we couldn't.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So if we got running, it
devolved into kind of hopping.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.933 align:middle line:84%
Whereas they could just run
because their suit weighed them

00:25:46.933 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
down enough to make up
for the difference in--

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they had more
control over the situation

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:90%
than you did?

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Absolutely.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So we were let out, and I
think there were six of us.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:84%
We were in groups of six
and then two soldiers.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Two soldiers and six of us.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And we walked out of the door
and into the environment,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.285 align:middle line:84%
and it was morning on Mars,
and a very light blue sky.

00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing
that I remember

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.083 align:middle line:84%
is, because of the lighter
gravity, we would--

00:26:13.083 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:90%
they gave us exercise.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
They said, now get out
and run from here to here

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:90%
so that we would get used to it.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
your first couple

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of steps where you
accelerate were OK,

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.475 align:middle line:84%
but then it devolved
into a hopping.

00:26:24.475 --> 00:26:26.597 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.597 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You could hurt yourself
doing that, couldn't you?

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:30.992 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah, we
fell down doing it.

00:26:30.992 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Which I was not as good
as the other guys were.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:84%
There were guys that
were way faster than me.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I found was there
was a nearby small crater,

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.648 align:middle line:84%
and I got in the crater
and ran around it.

00:26:40.648 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That must have been fun.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And I
could run like normal,

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'd say, hey, guys.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And they'd-- knock it off.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Get in line.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:90%
But I remember that.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:90%
That memory stood out.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.403 align:middle line:84%
That was my keystone memory
that's always stood out--

00:26:51.403 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
was running in that
crater because it was just

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.710 align:middle line:84%
fun in the middle of
knowing that I was probably

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:90%
going to die any minute.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.092 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big thing for me.

00:27:01.092 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, and we did
that, and we went out.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:90%
We went on a hike.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:90%
There were ruins.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
There were stone-- you
know people at a beach

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:90%
will stack stones?

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.380 align:middle line:90%
There were tall giant ones.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.838 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole
area that we went

00:27:12.838 --> 00:27:15.817 align:middle line:84%
through that was found that was
a ruin that we went through.

00:27:15.817 --> 00:27:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How tall were they?

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: 30 feet tall--

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I bet that
was impressive.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: --of rock, of
stones that somebody built,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:90%
not us.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
We went out, and hiked, and
we came back, and that was it.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.155 align:middle line:90%
That was our mission.

00:27:25.155 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day
or a couple days later,

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:90%
the other six guys would go.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You keep saying
that you were fodder.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that you
guys were trained to die?

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Is what you're saying, right?

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Absolutely.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You were trained to die.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:84%
You were trained
to commit suicide.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.658 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We were
a bounding maneuver.

00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:90%
We were bait so that the other--

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
the other soldiers
would split off from us

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and stay on higher
ground with bigger guns.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:90%
The first mission went out.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:84%
We went out for a
hike, and we came back.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Then the other guys went, and
in the meantime, we sat in our--

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:84%
with nothing to
do in our cubicle.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Typical military.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.962 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: That was
my life for a couple--

00:28:06.962 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
it was a week or two before I
went out on the next mission,

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.245 align:middle line:90%
and it was later in the day.

00:28:11.245 --> 00:28:12.620 align:middle line:84%
The first one was
in the morning,

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and the next one was
later in the day, midday,

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and the third one was
at night, right at dusk.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they're getting
you used to the environment.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah, or
however they planned it.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.605 align:middle line:84%
It was need to know, and we
didn't need to know much.

00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The second time we went
out, and when we came back,

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:29.600 align:middle line:90%
they were high fiving.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:90%
They were elated.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we went
out and that there were--

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:84%
the insectoids that
live there and just

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:84%
never made it to us because
they were taken out.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I went on a hike in the
desert and hiked back,

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know anything,
but they were elated.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It was high fives
across the board.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:84%
This was a brand new program,
and it was a trial run to them.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So the enemy were
these insectoids

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:90%
that you were fighting.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.833 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:28:56.833 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:84%
The third mission--
and we were supposed

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.350 align:middle line:84%
to go along the
bottom of a mountain,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
right along the bottom
of it, into a flat area

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.735 align:middle line:90%
and then cut across.

00:29:05.735 --> 00:29:07.110 align:middle line:84%
The mountain kind
of went around,

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.068 align:middle line:84%
and we were supposed to
cut across, and meet up

00:29:09.068 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
with the soldiers,
and come back.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think they did
everything in kilometers,

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
four kilometers out

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and four kilometers back,
something like that.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So we did, and the
weather got crappy,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:84%
which then, I mean--
the weather-- it could

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
blow in and be really dusty and
then blow out in a few minutes.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.355 align:middle line:90%
The weather was bad.

00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Mostly dust storms?

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Dust.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Clouds.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And the weather
got crappy, and we

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:84%
started getting away-- the two
soldiers were on the mountain,

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and we were down
along the bottom of it

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.170 align:middle line:84%
so they could see
us at all times.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And we started getting away
from them, and we knew it.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.945 align:middle line:84%
And three of us
got in an argument,

00:29:48.945 --> 00:29:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, we're going
to stay close to the mountain.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we've got
to follow the map,

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.715 align:middle line:84%
and that says go
this way, cut across.

00:29:56.715 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:90%
So they know what they're--

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what, are you
going to get in trouble?

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to go?

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And we fought.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
We got in a big
argument about it.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were they afraid
to go out in the open?

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.955 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We were
mentally damaged people.

00:30:06.955 --> 00:30:10.673 align:middle line:84%
We were not tough
guys by any means.

00:30:10.673 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:84%
We were all-- every
one of us knew

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.825 align:middle line:90%
we were afraid for ourselves.

00:30:13.825 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure, you were bait.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
You knew that if you
went out in the open

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that that could be
very dangerous to you.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And we were told
that you'd be able to hear them

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and to kill as many as you
can if you see any bugs--

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:90%
if you see the bugs.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Three guys went, and
they split off from us,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and the weather started
getting really windy.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And they stayed
parallel to the mountain

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.320 align:middle line:84%
where the soldiers
could see them,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.840 align:middle line:90%
and we stayed on the course.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And we got out a good distance,
and the weather got really bad.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:90%
It got black.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:90%
It got dark.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Not nighttime dark,
but dark from the dust?

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Imagine
a thunderstorm dark.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And we heard them.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:90%
We heard behind us--

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The clicks.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: --something moving.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.990 align:middle line:90%
You could hear.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It sounded like horses or--

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:90%
you could hear it.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.865 align:middle line:90%
You could hear them.

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It sounded almost like
horses, but different.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:84%
We heard them, and the radio
guy got on the radio and said,

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:90%
we need help.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Contact, contact.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
get to high ground.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.945 align:middle line:84%
Get somewhere high
so they could see us.

00:31:24.945 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:90%
They knew where we were at.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:90%
They had they had our--

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:84%
but they needed to
physically see us.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:90%
So we could see--

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
you know on a stormy
day when it's cloudy,

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.497 align:middle line:84%
but you can kind of
see a ray of sun?

00:31:35.497 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
There were rays of
sun coming through,

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.247 align:middle line:90%
and there was one on a hill.

00:31:38.247 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We said, run there
as fast as we can.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
front, and like I said,

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.908 align:middle line:90%
it devolved into hopping.

00:31:43.908 --> 00:31:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were sand
dunes, and we were

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:84%
hopping from the top of a
dune to another top of a dune.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And the other guys passed me
up because they were faster

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:90%
at it than me.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And then from behind us a row
of 30 insects came up behind us.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And they came along
the side of me.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
There were smaller ones,
kind of like a beetle,

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and they flapped their
wings as they ran.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:84%
They had wings that had
them run faster kind of.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:90%
They hopped, and they had wings.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:90%
And I got a shot off.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:90%
I was in the middle.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I was mid air.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I was jumping from
a dune to a dune,

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and I finally shot the gun.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course I
didn't hit anything.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And one came up behind me
and took my arm right off--

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:90%
the gun and the arm--

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:90%
bit it right off.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And I fell, and it stood on me.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was in complete shock,
and I thought, I'm dead.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I heard the other two guys
in front of me get killed.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
They were eaten or
bit up into pieces.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:90%
I later had found their body.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I sat there.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It held me down.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It stood on me.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just
saying over and over,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.380 align:middle line:84%
please don't kill me,
please don't kill me.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.300 align:middle line:84%
All of that psychological
training went out the window.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they
had programmed me was--

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to die.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to die.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I had
somewhere else in life.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Somehow-- I don't know how it
did it-- but it picked me up,

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and a third kind
of bug came over

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:84%
from where the other
two-- came over the dune.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was much different,
and a move different.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
It moved strange, and
it moved its head.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
It had antenna, and they had
balls on top of each other.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.980 align:middle line:90%
It had antenna.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you're bleeding
pretty badly, I would imagine.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I was
in shock from--

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:90%
I had no arm.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.138 align:middle line:84%
It walked up to me
slowly, and it kind of

00:33:33.138 --> 00:33:34.817 align:middle line:90%
moved its head awkwardly.

00:33:34.817 --> 00:33:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And when it got close enough to
me where it was face to face--

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and I was just totally in shock.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
what was going on.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:90%
I was totally beside myself.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:84%
When they say about people in
car accidents and the things

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:90%
they can go into shock--

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:90%
I was in that.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept begging,
please don't kill me, please

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
don't kill me.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.677 align:middle line:90%
Please, I don't want to die.

00:33:55.677 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to die.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.385 align:middle line:90%
Please don't kill me.

00:33:57.385 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:90%
I was just in tears.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And when he got up close to
me face to face with me--

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.060 align:middle line:90%
and it had mandibles.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And the antennas did this.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:84%
They were moving kind of
gently, and they went into me.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a dream
all of a sudden.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
I was back in the place
in Southern California

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:90%
in the Inyokern Air Base.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So now what
happened with the mantis?

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to figure out
whether he's going to kill you

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:22.969 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.802 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I was in
a dream state with it,

00:34:24.802 --> 00:34:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and I mean it was just
like standing-- literally

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.340 align:middle line:90%
just like standing in the room.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.699 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Oh, so he's going
through your memories?

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Yes, and he went
through my entire time up

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:90%
until--

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:84%
he went inside the
base where I was,

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and he showed me the cubicle
where I was sleeping.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It was empty.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else there but me
and him standing there.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:84%
It was like a dream, but it was
a waking memory that he was--

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.875 align:middle line:84%
and the whole time he
was explaining it I

00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:56.250 align:middle line:84%
couldn't hear what
he was saying,

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:84%
but I could perceive
that he was describing

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:84%
the scene to something
else, to somebody else.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Not the other insects around
us, but something far away.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.310 align:middle line:90%
He was describing what he saw.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.362 align:middle line:84%
And it went through
the entire time,

00:35:09.362 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and then it ended
up-- it showed me

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:84%
my living room of
my childhood house

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that I was taken from that
I didn't have memories of.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this
is who you are.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.310 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.150 align:middle line:84%
That was the other
thing he said.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find
out your purpose.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.060 align:middle line:84%

And at the end, he
said your purpose

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:90%
isn't for killing at all.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
purpose for killing.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.750 align:middle line:90%

in a hospital bed.

And they briefed
me, and then they

gave me a checkup and
some other treatment.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.600 align:middle line:84%

and they canceled our program.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:90%
The program was canceled.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:90%

strategic analysis,

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:90%
and they decided to cancel it.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:84%

geared around our program

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:90%
of what was going on.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.810 align:middle line:84%
