00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.210 align:middle line:10%
we're with Tim who is speaking
with us today from Germany.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes,
anticipates, and suggests

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:10%
various strategies connected
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.932 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting to be here.

00:00:42.932 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well, tell us.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
What does a tactical advisor
do in these covert programs?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, a tactical advisor
needs to oversee situations

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and then steers them
into a target direction,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and in my case, you start with
a conventional tactical advisor

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
career, and then way down
the rabbit hole you go.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So I was collecting
information on ETs,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
especially a special type of
ETs and all their breed and also

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
interfrequentials
or interfrequential,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:90%
non-terrestrial beings.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It's my first time
to come forward

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and to talk about
certain topics,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:84%
so I'm still trying to
feel myself through this.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the answers might
be a little vague, but yeah,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:90%
we'll get through it.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Tim, before we get
into the extraterrestrials,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
what was your motivation
for coming out publicly?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.665 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: My motivation has always
been towards transparency,

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:10%
Emery, and I've been
advocating transparency

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:10%
for years and years.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And 10 years ago, it hasn't
been possible to do so.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:10%
I got rebuked in a certain
way, and now things turned out

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:10%
to be a little different and I'm
trying to gain trust, and yeah,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:10%
so let's see if the reactions
and the feedback is positive,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:10%
then I'll happily share more.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Excellent.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Are you actually sanctioned
to share this information?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I'm being
used, and as long

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
as this matches with a
certain belief system of mine

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and the goodness of my heart,
I'm pretty fine with this.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So I know that there
are reasons why

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I am able to speak
about certain things.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, I'm not
being sanctioned.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not being officially
talking about certain things,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
but I know the situation is
so that I can speak publicly

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
while still trying to
maneuver certain topics.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What types of
corporations and governments

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
are working alongside
Germany as far as ET contact?

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's really
compartmentalized.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So you actually don't
have coworkers when you're

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
working with those projects.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
You're pretty much
offered tasks.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
You do those tasks,
you deliver, and then

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the information, the technical
stuff and the results

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:90%
get spread.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Unknown where it
goes then, and so

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
the interwoveness of
supranational institutions

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and corporations and
stuff, this is really

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
something that could lead
to like a doctoral thesis

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:90%
because it's so complex.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
The most people that I
have seen come together,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:90%
and this was about 30 people.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's very compartmentalized.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you talk
about that event?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:90%
30 people in that think tank?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I can't.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
In the last-- let
me put it this way.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
There are four major
events in the last 20 years

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
that were important enough
to be discussed globally

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
and this was one of them.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you offer some
examples of types of projects

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that you're involved with that
involved extraterrestrials?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: For example, you
get called into a project

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and somebody is showing
you a video and suddenly

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
three bug-type,
insect-like creatures,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.510 align:middle line:84%
beings appear, and you have no
audio, but you have the video

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're just bumping
around and somebody tells you,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:90%
what can we do with this?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
What's the message that
we receive from them?

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:90%
And then we try to analyze this.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So we go forwards and
backward in the video.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:90%
We see what we can do with this.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's all
about emotions, what can we

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:84%
do with this, and even though
this is not one of the ET types

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I was working a lot with.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:90%
So this has appeared.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Another example
would be there was

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
a specific type of
reptilian type of being

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that we had a bad
start with them

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and we certainly tried to
improve our relationship.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is when somebody
diplomatically kicks

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in and tries to
communicate with them.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily
want somebody

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
who ray guns their
children to talk with them.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You personally
were in direct contact

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:90%
with these extraterrestrials.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: In this case,
what I was talking about,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
it was just to give another
race the opportunity

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to sniff at somebody
who could diplomatically

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:90%
get involved with them.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, I was sitting
there and just having

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
a conversation, and
those types of beings

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
are very, very sensitive
to certain frequencies.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, I had a
lizard I loved from my heart,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and so I think those
beings sense this,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and this gave me the
opportunity to talk to them.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.450 align:middle line:10%
And the biggest project I've
been working on for years

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:10%
and years onward, I called
it Operation Götter Plan.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:10%
This was just a name I gave
it, but we helped a level 6

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:10%
being ascent and come
into a level 7 being,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:10%
if this makes sense to you.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the audience, Tim,
explain what these levels are.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Sure.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I know we have the
opportunity to come back

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
to frequential harmonics
later in some interviews,

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
but we need to understand
that the universe has

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
a certain structure
to it and it depends

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency, a
being, or an entity,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
a life form it's specific
to, and in this case,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a very
highly evolved species.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Level 6 is really,
really, really

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:84%
high in the realm of
experience and consciousness

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that this being has,
and we helped to ascend.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:84%
We helped to ascend to a
much higher level, and yeah.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The programs that you
mentioned that you worked on,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
did you have direct contact
with extraterrestrials

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
during working on
those programs?

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how did
that make you feel?

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yeah.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I could have a lot of different
emotions to it, to be honest.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there has been direct
contact over many, many years

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
with many key players
of the universe.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
As has been said, I've been
mostly privy to a certain kind

00:08:50.590 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
of ET race with all
the breeds in this race

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and in the frequentials.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:90%
So how did it make me feel?

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The way frequency works is
that, when you approach somebody

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
with a frequency that
is very different

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to your own frequency,
mostly the body

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
reacts kind of automatically.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So even though your
mind is really focused

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and your breathe and you
know what you're doing,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
then when you see
those beings then

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:84%
your body just reacts to it just
like on a roller coaster where

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, oh man, next
curve it's going down

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:90%
but the body is like screaming.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't a case or in a way
something we had to deal with

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.277 align:middle line:90%
and to get around with it.

00:09:48.277 --> 00:09:49.985 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: One of the
things you mentioned,

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Tim, earlier was
that you saw a video

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
with three bug-like
creatures bouncing around.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:10%
And there is a couple of times
when I was in the projects

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:10%
and they showed us
some videos on purpose

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:10%
that were disinformation videos
because not everything was

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:10%
100% correct and
real, and they do that

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:10%
just for protection
in case someone

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:10%
like you and I would go
out and tell the world.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So how do through that video
that was an authentic video?

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I
don't, but the thing

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
is this wasn't my project.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So I got called into it, because
some other tactical advisor was

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
looking at the video,
and this seemed

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
to be a message that
we have received

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and we needed to
make sense of it.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the way
conventional governance works

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
or tactical advisory works
that you have an opportunity

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
to know your talking partner
and you know how they think.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you get
information and you

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:84%
have absolutely no idea
what to do with it,

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.842 align:middle line:90%
so this was the case back then.

00:11:06.842 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many
species are there

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:90%
that you're aware of, Tim?

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Tens of thousands,
Emery, tens of thousands.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So it depends what
you call a species,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
because the way
the universe works

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is that there's
life to everything,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and if you see the possible ways
that can come to this question

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
when you're approaching
higher frequencies of life,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
then you have tens of thousands
of beings and life forms

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:90%
that you can interact with.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: How many
extraterrestrial beings

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:10%
were you directly in
contact with through this 20

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:10%
years of working as
this tactical advisor?

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I certainly
have met about 20 to 25

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:90%
different species.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Some more, some less intense,
and this very specific ET race

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:84%
or being that I worked
the most time with it,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:90%
it evolves constantly.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Almost every day.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is pretty
interesting to see,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
so there are lots
of new breeds that

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
are coming every day from
this special ET species.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you tell
us the extraterrestrials

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:90%
that are working with us?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I could,
but at this moment,

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to answer to
this question specifically,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
but there are lots
of different ETs

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
that are involved
in certain projects

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
around humanity for years and
years, and after World War II,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
we have an accumulation
of certain projects

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:90%
that are going on.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So let me add something
to the question, if I can.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, please.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Because those life
forms I was working with,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:90%
they tend to mostly give advice.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Some eagerly disputed,
some well accepted,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and while most projects
were similar humanoid,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:84%
non-terrestrials are
working with human Terrans.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Those projects are about
money, about resources,

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:84%
about technology, and especially
the interfrequentials or higher

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:84%
frequential beings
I was involved

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
with, they don't really
care about those things

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because they have
either transcended

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:07.720 align:middle line:84%
the experience materialistically
or they're coming back,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:84%
reaching back to us in
a temporal dynamic way.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's unilaterally about
technology and mostly

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
about some different
type of agenda.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.665 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you elaborate
more on the specific agenda?

00:14:28.665 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, especially
the interfrequential,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
non-terrestrial beings are
reaching back to Earth in order

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
to hear certain timelines,
to learn, and to experience

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:84%
certain information, and to keep
the natural overall evolution

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of the universe going.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
kinds of interests

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
that especially the higher
frequential beings have.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you
mentioned these 20

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial species
that you interacted with.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And how did you feel about that?

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what was that experience
like to be with a higher

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:90%
dimensional being?

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM: It's mind
blowing, in a way,

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:10%
because mostly everything I
experience about our universe

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:10%
comes from those experiences,
and it's interesting to me

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:10%
to see how differently species
can think even though we

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:10%
share the same dimension.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, some beings
that I've worked with they

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:84%
tend not to sleep
because they're

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in the multisolar system, so
those planets don't have night.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
They did not evolve any
kind of sleeping pattern

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:90%
so they do not tend to dream.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:10%
So it's just interesting to see
that some ETs are interested

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:10%
just to--

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:10%
some of them were standing
in somebody's bedroom

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:10%
and just watching
humans sleeping

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:10%
and dreaming without even
thinking about being invasive.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So while this is a very
natural thought to us

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that I don't go to my
neighbor and open the door

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and watch him sleep,
this is something

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that some ETs do not
feel skeptical about,

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:90%
they just do it.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: They don't see that
it's very awkward to do that

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:10%
and why we would
judge that if we

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:10%
were to do that to each other.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, the most
awkward thing for them

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:84%
is the reaction we show, because
those beings-- it took us

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
a long time to
educate those beings,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
even though they are
beyond words intelligent,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but to tell them that taking
people outside from the bed

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:84%
and looking at them is something
that could scare a human being.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
It's something that they
don't necessarily think of,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
so this is something--
and they got scared too.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So the thing about
frequential cooperation

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
or dealing or sharing one
common frequential space

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is that, when I
react very heavily,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
the person I react to
reacts heavily too.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So if I get scared, they sense
it and they react upon it.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
They tend to freeze
the person or they

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:84%
tend to try to communicate
with them on a mind

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
basis or psionically, and
they couldn't understand

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:84%
that the reaction a human would
show to this kind of thing

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's behavior, yes.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Behavior, yeah.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that I found really,

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
really interesting,
because to us, it's

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
totally natural that somebody
would react this way.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's very fascinating.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell me, when you
say take them out of the bed,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:84%
are they doing that through
some sort of frequency?

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Is it an astral state
or are they actually

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
just physically taking someone
out of the bedroom there?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the involvement
with extraterrestrials

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
was pretty physical.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of those beings have their
own interest in human evolution

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and they know that
there was some kind

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of starting event that
was necessary to open

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
the minds of people.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning it
was pretty physical.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:84%
While those kind of
abduction scenarios,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and to my understanding are
occurring far less right

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
now because the relationship to
certain neighbors and other ETs

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is much better than
in the beginning.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are they
doing with these humans

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:90%
that they are taking?

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It depends.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the species.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Mostly those I
got involved with,

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
those were the type
of species that try

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:90%
to collect data from one point.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
They try to set
up communication.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, some of these
beings try to teach people.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So there are two kinds of
human beings, let's call it

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:84%
this way, that are
very likely to get

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:90%
targeted for an open contact.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
these are hybrids.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So when a
extraterrestrial species

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
decides to make a hybrid that
is born by a human mother,

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
then they assure that this
hybrid gets all the information

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and they get in contact with
this hybrid and the other type

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
of being might be
interfrequential beings that

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
reincarnate into a
human body, and those

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
tend to get lost
sometimes because they get

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
socialized as a human being.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
A human being that
is coming back

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
from a higher interfrequential
being and reincarnated

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:84%
into a human being and
hybrids, those beings,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:84%
they all have to deal
with human socialization.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So with behavior
rhythms of humans--

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Emotions?

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: --information.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Emotions too.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.430 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of humans ask
theirself, why don't they

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:84%
fit into society,
and sometimes they

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:84%
are hybrids are
reincarnated into society,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:90%
they don't even know it.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So then a manipulator species
try to come back to them

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and try to guide them
on the right path.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:90%
This is the most scenarios.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yes, I see a lot of
that here on planet Earth.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of humans
are very confused.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So how did you
communicate with them?

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a special device
or was it through telepathy?

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Again, it depends.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
There are some
types of beings that

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:90%
are perfectly speaking German.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:10%
Perfectly speaking humanoid
languages, because to them,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:10%
the earthly languages
are not that

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:10%
complex it's pretty much that,
from a source perspective,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:10%
those languages have evolved
a little bit off the track

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:10%
and got simplified around--

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:10%
over the years and
decades and millennia

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:10%
where languages evolved.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So for some of them,
it's pretty easy

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to speak a certain
humanoid language,

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and well, with others, we
tried whatever we could,

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
like starting with
painting stuff

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and showing stuff and
trying to communicate

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
with them on a psionic
basis, emotionally.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So there are a
lot of ways to try

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with them,
because what you need

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to imagine, Emery,
is that you don't

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
have a common
ground of experience

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:90%
when you come to those beings.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:10%
We're talking in English and
we're sharing a common mindset.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:10%
A mindset we both have
because of our experience

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:10%
on this planet, so we can
communicate fairly quickly

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:10%
and easily, but again,
there are sometimes

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:33.713 align:middle line:10%
super interesting ways of
thinking to certain behaviors.

00:23:33.713 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I can see
that, because there's

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:90%
just so many species out there.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They're probably just one
language for them to interact.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:90%
What was your favorite species?

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's an
interesting question.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:10%
So I think I do enjoy working
with interfrequential beings

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:10%
because they have a totally
different perspective

00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:10%
to our reality because they
ascended this experience

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:10%
and they are looking
at our universe

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:10%
from a different perspective.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they have an
overview of temporal events

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
that can happen
or have happened,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:90%
collapsing timelines and stuff.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:10%
So this is very profound
and very interesting

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:10%
to communicate with them.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: In the projects
that you worked in,

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:10%
could you describe any of
the 3D extraterrestrials?

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: We certainly know that
some non-terrestrial life forms

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:84%
or species do look
very human-like.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
While I cannot talk too
specifically about the types I

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:84%
was working with yet, but those
I was involved with were pretty

00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:84%
exotic, and if you are asking
me if I have a favorite ET,

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:84%
then I think integration is
when you're not only invited

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
to somebody's house or contact
but also you get to participate

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and become friends with
somebody who's really exotic

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and different to yourself.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is something I
learn to enjoy a lot.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Name some of these
exotic energies or exotic 3D

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
looking beings.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:90%
What's so exotic about them?

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, in a
way they tend to look

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.540 align:middle line:84%
humanoid in a sense
of walking on two feet

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.280 align:middle line:90%
and having two arms.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.250 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
distinguishable to a Terran

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:84%
person and looking
very exotically.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting
thing, again, to me

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:84%
was just to see how
different their mindset was.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:10%
So one of the species
I got to work with

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:10%
was really convinced that it
was having made us in a way.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So this was something that
was really interesting to me

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to see the belief system of
certain really evolved beings,

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, I was asking
myself the question,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:90%
did my parents make me?

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Did a creator brought
me into existence, or am

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I making myself every
minute constantly,

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.883 align:middle line:84%
and there's some truth to
all of those questions.

00:26:49.883 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that's great.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:84%
That's something I wanted to
go a little bit more deeper.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
The former Israeli space
security chief and also

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:84%
former general had announced
that extraterrestrials

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
were communicating with
us through the Galactic

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Federation.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about this?

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Is there a so-called
Galactic Federation?

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So my take on this
is that building alliances

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
is some of the first steps
in a dualistic universe.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
When you're thinking
about your own family

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and about small children,
they tend to go to the father

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and try to achieve something
and if they get a no,

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:84%
they get to the mother
and say, hey, my dad

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:90%
just told me it's OK.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So building alliance and
federations is pretty natural,

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and those federations
are all over the place.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: All over planet
Earth or in space?

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Both.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:10%
So as well on planet Earth,
we have alliance building

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:10%
everywhere in every situation
where a dualistic life

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:18.420 align:middle line:10%
form is dealing with
another dualistic life form,

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:10%
when they come to a
certain point of agreement,

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:10%
they try to build an alliance.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:10%
And while I'm not a
ufologist, and I'm not

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:10%
too sure about what people mean
when they talk about Galactic

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:10%
Federation, I can tell
that, on the project

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:10%
I was involved with,
there was a lot of effort

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.110 align:middle line:10%
to build something
like this and to set up

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:10%
a Federation for this
interfrequential being

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:10%
that we lifted or
ascended, and we're in it.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So before we
wind up this episode,

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
you've been hearing a lot
about the UAPs, of course,

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
through the mainstream media,
through our government,

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and what is your take on that?

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So what do
you think about UFOs,

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of topics and
emotions associated with it.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But when we're
talking about UAPs,

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:84%
this is a new terminology which
the British tactical team came

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
up with, and the
thought of it is

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that, once we have
a new terminology,

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the brain has the ability
to connotate it differently

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:90%
with different emotions.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And right at this
very moment, the Earth

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:84%
itself is pretty much
locked up by the Earth

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:84%
military personnels, and that's
actually not really a chance

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:84%
for illegal aliens, so to
speak, to come to enter

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:90%
the airspace of the Earth.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we see a
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, then we
can be pretty sure

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:30.027 align:middle line:84%
that it's most likely something
that has been placed there.

00:30:30.027 --> 00:30:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell me your
thoughts on disclosure

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
what that's going to look
like in the future for us.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I got to say that this is
a very fluctorial process we're

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.310 align:middle line:84%
seeing right now in
front of our very eyes.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
There are lots and
lots of reasons

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:53.210 align:middle line:84%
to empirically understand
that disclosure is happening

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening now
right in front of our eyes,

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and we know that we
are very consciousness

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:90%
based in this universe.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I would
like to try, and I

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.520 align:middle line:84%
hope there are some people
around the planet who

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.690 align:middle line:84%
would just do this just
to say something out

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
loud into existence, like
Earth shift happily now.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
That this is something
that we can do

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:90%
to participate in this process.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Everyone at home,
wherever you are,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
just to speak it into
existence as if you mean it.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Earth shift happily now.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Earth
shift happily now.

It was very beautiful.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, Tim, thanks for
being on the show.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.100 align:middle line:84%
You've been a
great, great person.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so excited
to finally meet you.

I'm Emery Smith, and this
