>>EMERY SMITH: Today,
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
Operation Brother's Keeper.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.078 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:37.287 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY: Thank
you, Emery, good to be here.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, what is
Operation Brother's Keeper?

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Operation
Brother's Keeper

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
is a military operation where we
assisted the country of Brazil

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in 1978.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Go back a little bit,
early part of December,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
end of December 1977,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
an incident happened,
or a series of incidents

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
happened, in a location
called Colares in Brazil.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:10%
People or villagers observed a
craft flying around in the sky,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:10%
shooting some type of a
beam down at the ground.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, these beams
would hit people,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
causing excruciating pain
and blistering of the skin.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for days
after days after days.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
The Brazilian military
responded, trying

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:90%
to shoot down these things.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:84%
They were identified
as saucer shaped,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
so the Brazilian
government immediately

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.710 align:middle line:84%
thought that these were
extraterrestrial crafts flying

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.155 align:middle line:90%
around this area of Colares--

00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and why they were doing
what they were doing,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
which was trying to hurt
the people on the ground.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
In over a period of several
days, a number of people

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
were injured and taken
to local hospitals.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Doctors at the hospitals
would examine these wounds

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.685 align:middle line:84%
and figured out they were
some sort of a radiation.

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, no.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They had to figure
out what was going on.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Why was this craft flying
around, doing these things?

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
After a number of
people were injured,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.289 align:middle line:84%
Brazilian military, the Army and
the Air Force, were involved.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:90%
They wanted additional help.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So they asked the
United States government

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:90%
to come in to assist them.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So in January of 1978,
the Air Force Office

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
of Special Investigations
support unit at Brasilia

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and another unit in Argentina
responded to Colares

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:90%
to investigate this incident.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And we started
interrogating people,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
interviewing people,
trying to find

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:90%
evidence of what had occurred.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is after
the fact, of course,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and we found some evidence
of some small particle that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
was found in one particular area
where these beams being shot

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
down from this craft hit and hit
this hard rock area, like shale.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And these small pieces had
embedded into this rock.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have
evidence of something.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So OSI took this material
because the villagers

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
told OSI agents where these
beams were hitting the ground,

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and they packaged it up and sent
it off to a lab to be analyzed.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
They also were able to
get medical records,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and the United States government
brought in an embassy doctor

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
from Brasilia, the US embassy,
to examine some of these people

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and try to determine what these
injuries were caused by, whether

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
it was, in fact, a radiation
burn, a laser burn,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
because, even in the '70s, we
had lasers, or something else.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they found out
was that they don't know.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:90%
They weren't laser burns.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
They were similar
to radiation burns,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
but there was no radiation
found inside the wound

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
or inside the victim's body.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they have
the burns, but there's

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:84%
no radioactive isotopes
that they could find.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exactly,
nothing indicating

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that ionized radiation,
which would have caused

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
these burns because ionized
radiation, either alpha, beta,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
or gamma, could have
caused these burns.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find any evidence
or any remnants or materials

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
indicating that
this was radiation.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do if those
patients later on still

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
survived or died of
any weird cancers?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Some passed
away from other reasons.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a set of people, and
I don't recall exactly how many

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
but probably five or six people,
that all died from liver failure

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:90%
some years later.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if they
died because of this.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
were subjected

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
to some sort of a laser burn
or some burn on their bodies.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
When we talked to these victims,
asking them what they saw,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
what they felt, what they
experienced, some of them

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
said we were walking
down the street.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:90%
We were walking in our field.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:90%
We were planting crops.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm at work.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And these beams came down
from the sky, and they hit us.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And most of the injuries were
either to the face, hands,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:90%
or the thoracic area--

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The
exposed areas, yeah.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exposed
area of the chest.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they were at first.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of the victims said,
we saw these creatures.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
They not only are shooting
from an aircraft or UFO.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
They came down to the
ground, and they got out.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And they chased us,
hideous-looking devils.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:90%
They called them devils.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And in Portuguese, they
named it "Chupa-Chupa"

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:90%
or sucker or suckers.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of these creatures
that came out of this craft

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
actually grabbed victims,
attached to their skin,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and started sucking.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they called them
in Portuguese Chupa-Chupa, which

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:90%
is sucker-sucker.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do they look like?

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.058 align:middle line:90%
How big were these creatures?

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were
5 to 6 foot tall.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:90%
They had hideous-looking faces.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that we
could get from the people

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:90%
were, they were devils.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you know, if a
human brain can't establish fact

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
from what it's
looking at, they're

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
going to relate to something
they already knew about.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And these people
knew of the Devil

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
because they were
highly religious people.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:90%
They're all Roman Catholics.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And so all they would tell
us was that they were devils.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
They looked like devils
with sucking mouths.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:90%
They looked like devils.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:90%
This is 1977.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't give
them pictures which

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:90%
would taint their recollection.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And all we could do was ask them
to explain or draw pictures.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
They drew some pictures
of what they observed

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.765 align:middle line:84%
and what these
creatures looked like.

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ah, amazing.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.420 align:middle line:90%
What about the pilots?

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.628 align:middle line:90%
Did you interview the pilots?

00:06:56.628 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:90%
What did they say?

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The Air Force pilots
saw these crafts flying.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They could never
get close enough

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to get a full
identification on the craft.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
They knew they weren't
conventional crafts.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
One particular Brazilian
pilot said, well,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you right now that
it wasn't any kind of crafts

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:90%
He'd been a pilot for 15 years.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
He actually was trained
in the United States,

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:90%
so he knew different aircrafts.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, we have mirages, and
we have these other aircrafts.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
We know what an
aircraft looks like.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
These things weren't like
anything we've ever seen,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and we could never
catch up to it.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
As we got closer,
it would speed away,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
or would quickly
change directions.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
As we're flying towards it, it
would stop and change directions

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
over top of us, so we can never
fully identify the crafts.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But he said they
were flying saucers.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:90%
They were saucer shaped.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In relation to the
Varginha sighting in the 1990s

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
in Brazil, where people saw
these beings that were red.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying
they were demons

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:90%
and Satan and all this stuff.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Is there any correlation
to this one, where people

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:90%
are saying the same thing?

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's a lot of
similarities between the Colares

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:90%
and the Varginha sighting.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.840 align:middle line:10%
The identification of these
creatures are somewhat similar.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
The beams that were shot at
these people, they're similar.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's some similarities,
and there's some aren't.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we just stick
with the similarities,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:84%
this incident in 1977 and
a Varginha incident later

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.031 align:middle line:84%
on in the 1990s could
be the same species

00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:38.906 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:46.278 align:middle line:84%
So what evidence did OSI find
with the Colares incident?

00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, they found a lot.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:84%
The examination of the victims,
number one, medical doctors

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
examined them, took tissue
samples, blood samples,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:90%
X-rays from the victims.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
The OSI investigation
involved 17

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:84%
of the victims, where they took
blood and X-rays and so forth

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:90%
from them, and skin samples.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:84%
OSI then went to doctors that
examined these victims, trying

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
to get anything that these
doctors had taken as evidence

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and kept for analysis.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
The doctors that were with OSI
wanted blood samples from right

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
after this incident
happened, not a month later,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:90%
when OSI was there in January.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of samples
kept by these doctors,

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and they gave them
to OSI to be analyzed

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:90%
or sent off to be analyzed.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything went back
to the United States,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and everything went to the Armed
forces Institute of Pathology

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the medical
samples were analyzed.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
The samples were taken,
as I said earlier,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
from whatever material
that was hitting the rocks

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:90%
and maintained there.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
There's particles of
some kind of metal.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
That was sent to
another laboratory

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
at Utah, Dugway
Proving Grounds, which

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
has probably the best
metallurgical facility

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they went back
there to try to figure out

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:90%
what these things were.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:84%
At scene, the OSI interviewed
the doctors, getting statements

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
from them, interviewed
the military people that

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:90%
were on scene.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the doctors
that had examined,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
he examined most and
treated most of the victims.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:90%
He died mysteriously later.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
The captain that was in
charge of the investigation,

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:84%
he committed suicide
a few months later.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Two of the people that had
face-to-face experiences

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
with these creatures
committed suicide.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
They went crazy prior
to committing suicide.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So something happened, whether
it was a psychological effect

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
or some other effect
on these people

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that caused them to commit
suicide, which you really

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
have to delve deep into
understanding this.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to figure
out, what did they see

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
or what did they experience
that was so horrifying that they

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:90%
would commit suicide?

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that
was remnants of--

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:90%
that still inside their head?

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, implanted
something, some memories or--

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.895 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I don't know.

00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:24.836 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or just the experience
itself was so overwhelming.

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So traumatic--
this experience

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:90%
was probably so traumatic.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the statements made
by a physician that survived

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:84%
said, if you experienced what
we experienced, the trauma that

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
was placed on this
community and maybe

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that
this could happen again,

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want
to be a part of it,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
if you were
psychologically unstable,

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
that might lead you
to committing suicide

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:84%
to prevent yourself from ever
being involved in something

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:90%
like this again.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there
nonhuman intelligences that

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:90%
were involved?

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
What could you
tell us about that?

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: One of the
witnesses told OSI agents

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:10%
that it was something
like a robot,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:10%
and he referred to
it as a robot that he

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:10%
saw at one of these
landing sites,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:10%
where this craft had landed.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:10%
And these creatures got
out that look-- that they

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:10%
were referring to as devils.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:90%
He said it wasn't on the ground.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
It was more or less in
the air, moving around.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Back in those days, drones
weren't really in a circle--

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --balloons or model
airplanes that you could fly.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And OSI agents were
asking, it could

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:90%
have been a model airplane.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could fly
these model airplanes.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.533 align:middle line:90%
He had never seen or heard--

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, what is that?

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.283 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He didn't
know what they were.

00:12:43.283 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing he
could refer to is a robot.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there was
some other form

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
of nonhuman life or
nonbiological life

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
forms, robotic forms that
were involved in this.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But really, we don't have any
other evidence other than what

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
other people have said,
statements taken from witnesses.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I have heard
reports about citizens

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.127 align:middle line:90%
missing after this incursion.

00:13:09.127 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, there were a
number of people that went

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:90%
missing, and I don't know--

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How many?

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.082 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Eight confirmed
that we're missing.

00:13:16.082 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it during the
event or after the event?

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: After the event,
witnesses or police or family

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:84%
members went to the
residence of these people.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:90%
And they were gone.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, were they abducted?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Did they just flee
and never came back?

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, but
they're missing.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And they were missing--

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
the police took
reports of missing.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.865 align:middle line:84%
And to the best of my knowledge,
they've never been found.

00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:40.665 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:13:40.665 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Other than the radiation
burns, were there

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:90%
any other injuries of any kind?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the liver problems
that people died of later,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know why.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was connected or not
connected, they don't know why.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.957 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a hard call.

00:13:54.957 --> 00:13:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And maybe the
psychological trauma

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:84%
or something that happened
in their brain that causes

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:90%
people to commit suicide.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
That could have been a lasting
effect of having this encounter

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:90%
with these extraterrestrials.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did the OSI
recover east of the forest?

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.360 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They found an object
that they didn't initially

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:90%
connect to this incident.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But later on,
because of some debris that

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:84%
was found at some
other location,

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
they went back to that site
and recovered this object.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And they thought it was some
sort of a homing or a navigation

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
system that was dropped
by the extraterrestrials

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to show other crafts where
to come to, they think.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is just a theory.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that anybody ever
actually ever verified that.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But that was the theory
that this thing-- and I'm

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
sure it was analyzed
later, but I

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:84%
don't have the information
on what they found,

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
because everything we
gathered there was taken back

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:90%
to the States.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there anything
else that was revealed

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:90%
medically after this testing?

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Well, all
the medical tests

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:10%
were sent to the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And what they found there was
some of the tissue samples

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and some of the blood,
the molecular structure

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:84%
of skin of some of the
injured skin was changed.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And some of the blood
had something in it

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
that the Armed Forces Institute
couldn't determine what it was,

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
something strange.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But these were the victims
that suffered these wounds.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And to the best of my
knowledge, we still

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.640 align:middle line:84%
haven't figured out
why or how these beams

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:84%
could affect the molecular
structure of skin or tissue

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:90%
or blood.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was
found at the Armed Forces

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Institute of Pathology.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it wasn't
every single test, but just

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
certain tests from
certain people.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So aside
from this case, Rick,

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:90%
it seems pretty violent.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:84%
This species is
attacking people.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, in the military,
we have shot them down.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:90%
They shoot at us.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We shoot back,
that kind of thing.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about civilians here.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what do you make of
this attack on civilians?

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good question.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:90%
These people are nonviolent.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They didn't threaten these
extraterrestrials in any way.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:90%
They have no weapons.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:90%
They have no guns in Brazil.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Why did they do this?

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Why did these
extraterrestrials do harm

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:90%
on these innocent civilians?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it because
they're so violent,

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
they're such a violent species
that they want to cause harm?

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Or they were trying to
gather tissue samples

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:90%
from these people.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they do it, by
shooting this beam into them

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.990 align:middle line:90%
and extracting stuff out.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing that
these medical professionals

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.748 align:middle line:84%
could figure out because
these are innocent people.

00:17:24.748 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
These species come in and
start shooting at them,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and probably even
abducting some of them.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
For what reason?

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess these extraterrestrials
was just a violent species.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It seems they came
there on a specific mission,

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:84%
just to harvest and
go, because they

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
didn't shoot any craft down.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, they didn't
shoot that I know of.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.355 align:middle line:10%
They didn't shoot
any aircrafts--

00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: And they could have.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And It's
very highly possible

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that this species
of extraterrestrials

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
came here for a
scientific exploration.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
one way that they

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
were using to gather the
tissues of a human being,

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
realize that they

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:84%
were trying to harm somebody
while they were doing it.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess that could be also
an answer to what happened.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what was
the final conclusion

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.523 align:middle line:90%
with OSI with this event?

00:18:17.523 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the
final conclusion

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
was that an extraterrestrial
species was present.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, it was
either scientifically

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:31.460 align:middle line:84%
gathering information or
evidence from a human.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Or they were a violent species.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But they never shot
down an aircraft, as you said.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And they never attacked
a military installation.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it was a full-scale
hostile act, the only isolated

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:84%
everything to this one
little community of Colares.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:90%
They didn't go beyond that.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So we would have to get in the
minds of the extraterrestrials

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to figure out why they
did what they did.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So have we ever seen
this species again, Rick?

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Possibly at Varginha.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
That could have been
the same species.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know as much
about that case.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
OSI was there later on, and
they did do an investigation.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:84%
But that's still
highly classified.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.798 align:middle line:84%
So it could very well
been the same species.

00:19:20.798 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Rick,
it's always a pleasure

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:90%
to have you on the show.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming in.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you for having me.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
