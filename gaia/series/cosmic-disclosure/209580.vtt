>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
we are with David Adair, a
space technology consultant

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
and a retired field
officer from the Office

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:10%
of Naval Intelligence.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Thank you.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is time travel
theoretical, or is it already

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:90%
happening, David?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I can't say for sure.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.015 align:middle line:90%
I haven't worked in.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:90%
And is it possible?

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it probable?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
The reason probably
not is the cost

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that would be involved in this
thing would be extravagant.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking
billions of dollars

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
to get the hardware
assembled up.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But for people to
say it's impossible,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's just a matter of--

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:90%
it's a question of two things.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:90%
How much, and how soon?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:84%
How much will
determine how soon.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm not aware of any
official programs

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:90%
that ever tried to run one.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you
mess up in time travel,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:90%
it's a localized problem.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it's your
problem, not mine.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
If you screw up, your
timeline's messed up.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The rest of us standing around
won't even know it happened.

[CHUCKLES]

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, Germany has a
long history of time traveling

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:90%
attempts, at least.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And is it possible?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes, 100%.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Einstein basically dealt with
the question and other physics.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Has it been done?

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Basically the question is, do
you time travel by technology

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
or do you time travel by
the natural possibilities

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:90%
that the universe itself has?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
that with you, Dave.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
There are other
species that do not

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
have this impression
of time that we have.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So they basically can decide
what time they want to live in.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So time is basically a
temporal dimension for them,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:90%
which makes it a livable space.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So they can basically
walk through it.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You can't
describe if it's a device

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:90%
or is it something mental?

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:90%
If the organism can--

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: For the Greys,
it's a mixture of both.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So what they have done
as a species is they

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
have installed a kind of
pseudo-mental-technological

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
network all over the universe
and across different dimensions

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies as
well, because they

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
are exploring the universe
in a very rapid pace.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So they make sure that
wherever they come to,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
they install these
outposts in order

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
to quick save their own
consciousness, which

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
is basically a kind
of cloud system

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
where they upload
their own consciousness

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and their information.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can redistribute
and get back to that.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are their 3D physical
bodies dematerializing

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:90%
and then rematerializing?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just they walk
through something or they--

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So it's not a technology
where they enter a gate

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:90%
and go through it.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
It's more the understanding
of the universe.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:10%
And by having installed this
kind of network and can--

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:10%
by that I mean upload
their own consciousness

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:10%
into any time
whenever they want.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
They then make sure that
they have these little puppet

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
bodies, which they
artificially use.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And they send them somewhere
rematerializing, I guess,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:90%
and entering them with the body.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's hugely complex.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that's the
way a human could travel.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it needs some
kind of understanding

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
to the universe and the
reality to the universe,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
some connectivity to it.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, humans definitely
have made experiments

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:90%
with time travel.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm informed,
they got pretty successful

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
with shooting laser beams
through temporal dimensions

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and even organic material.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.483 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Dave, what would
you like to add to that?

00:04:49.483 --> 00:04:50.858 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I
have this story.

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
leave the names out.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Because I have to.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'll give you some details,
but enough to where you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:90%
could actually check it out.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:84%
What happened was there was this
woman in Chicago, a Black lady.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And she was at home
in her living room.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And she had her nightgown
on and her little slippers.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And her daughter
was in her jammies.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And the daughter
said, oh, look, Mommy.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's this big white,
swirling disk, light,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the room.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The daughter walks
right into it.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Being a little toddler.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, pretty light, and walked in.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The mother, being a
mother, ran after her.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Dove in and got her.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And now the mother is sitting in
a dorm room in Toronto, Canada.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And the boy studying
for his test

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.365 align:middle line:84%
looks over near this Black
lady and a little child there.

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, what
are you doing here?

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So he calls the
police, trespassing.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:90%
The police check it out.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
they checked out--

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
said, we checked out the
trains, the planes, the boats.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Cars, rent-a-cars.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Every mode of transportation.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
record of anything.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
They're here just
in their jammies.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, we don't
know what to make of this.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But because it's inter-countries
now, the FBI is involved.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:90%
So the FBI is checking it out.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, she
didn't use any obvious mode

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:90%
of transportation.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But then when they
canvassed the neighborhood,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
people saw her only
within 20 minutes.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you get from Chicago to
Toronto, Canada, in 20 minutes?

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:90%
And they go, what is going on?

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.888 align:middle line:90%
So they have us look at it.

00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And I come here go, what do
you want me to do about it?

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, how is she?

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So can you give us
any kind of clue?

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'll
give you a theory.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:90%
I said, I think what happened--

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I've been sitting here for an
hour with you guys talking.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
This planet has moved
100,000 miles through space

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:90%
in one hour.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the speed we travel.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So what could have
happened-- the Earth

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:90%
passed through a mini wormhole.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter steps in, and
she goes after her daughter.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Damn good thing that they only
ended up in Toronto, Canada,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
not on some planet
with no atmosphere

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:90%
or in the middle of the Sun.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And we are left with a
quandary of trying to explain,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and we can't.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:90%
So we just flew the woman home.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I went back for a follow
up only one week later.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:90%
The house is gone.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's flattened.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And there's
a chain link fence

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:90%
around with government fencing.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:84%
This property is now property
of the United States government.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Da, da, da, stay off of it.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's locked up.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.725 align:middle line:90%
And that's all.

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I left and never went back.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But something happened
and even to this day,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:90%
I keep thinking about it.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.055 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
real time travel.

00:08:14.055 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
they locked it up

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
because they maybe thought
it could happen again

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:90%
in the same spot?

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That was a
reasonable thought I had.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Like, boy, you don't want
this to happen here again.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And they think that
wormholes, some theories

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:90%
is that it repeats itself.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:90%
So it may do that.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think they're just
covering their bases.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:90%
But the woman was gone.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find her.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:90%
No trace, no forwarding address.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Just gone.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But it does look
really suspicious,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:90%
like it was a cover up.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Because that situation raised
more questions than they

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:90%
could ever answer.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
first and only case

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I ever come in contact where
somebody physically was gone

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
from their house
thousands of miles

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
away in just a matter
of minutes, seconds.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.260 align:middle line:90%
So what was that?

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the
difference between time travel

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:90%
and changing timelines?

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Tim?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think I
can answer this.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So dimensions are
basically units in order

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
to measure where you
are located in space.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
A temporal dimension
is another dimension

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:84%
that you add to it so you
can basically determine where

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:90%
someone is in time and space.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
about time traveling,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
then basically this is
like modifying and altering

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the coordinates and the
algorithm of your own, well,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:90%
material body.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And your awareness as
well, because you can time

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:84%
travel with your awareness
without your body,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and you can time travel by
readjusting your material

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:90%
body to another position.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
This is basically time
traveling a timeline.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So the universe has
a tree-like structure

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
in regards to time, which means
you have a very big, thick time

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:84%
strain in the middle,
which is a stable timeline

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:84%
for the universe to succeed, to
have a sustainable development.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And you have all these
individual timelines

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
forming around it in
a fractal movement.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Which, if you look
from it from the top,

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.840 align:middle line:84%
it looks a little bit like
a tree that goes down.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So basically every one of us is
on its own individual timeline.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
And you can do whatever.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
You called it a localized
problem, which is basically it.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can mess around
with your own timeline.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But you will not necessarily
affect the time string

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The universe has this
interesting pattern

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that it recorrects
so-called failed timelines.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Which means when your own
timeline gets destabilized,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:84%
you basically get reintegrated
into the major stable time

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:90%
strain in the middle.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's error proof mechanism
that the universe naturally

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:90%
has.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With timelines
and time travel,

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:84%
is there someone
in charge of that?

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Is there an
extraterrestrial race?

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Or have you heard of this?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a governing situation
on time travel and timelines.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: So--

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And laws.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: As always,
those are in charge

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:90%
who put themselves in charge.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
it's their timeline.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's their timeline
and they have the algorithms.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:90%
So is there someone in charge?

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are some species that
have put themselves in charge.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And they correct timelines
and they recorrect.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.667 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what they're doing.

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are these
species that are in charge?

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The most information
I got is about the Greys.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They do it.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They've put themselves
into controlling timelines

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:90%
and recorrecting them.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
A reptile species that are
also capable of doing so.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:90%
The interesting thing is--

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
or the most interesting
thing is what Being Six

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
told us is that we're all on a
very, very old, ancient thought

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Which is basically the universe
at some point at its origin

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
theoretically and expands
from that position.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're pretty much at the
outer end of that thought,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we are
very, very far away.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:84%
What we perceive
here as something

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:90%
that's actually already done.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:90%
It's already solved.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So we're still experiencing
it, because we're inside of it.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's already solved.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And what this
species are doing is

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:84%
they are pretty much
going back through time,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:84%
because they can travel
that, and correct things.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So that in the end,
even though we're here,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
we are all ending up at the
stable point of unification

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.442 align:middle line:90%
at some point, at some time.

00:13:34.442 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware
of any events in history

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:90%
that may be modified?

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we raised the
question and we got the answer.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So they talked about
the Cuba conflict,

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
which is something where they
say they modified things.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it turned out badly
in some other versions,

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:90%
in some other timelines.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And they put it
together so that we have

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:90%
the outcome that we now have.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
The thing about
temporal development

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:84%
is that once it's
done, it's done.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
not possible to think

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:84%
about what has happened if that
has been a failed timeline.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Because a failed timeline
gets reintegrated.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And you have a stable one.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.907 align:middle line:90%
And basically, we're all alive.

00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where does
the Akashic Record

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:90%
fit into this theory of thought?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Oh, the Akashic
Record is basically

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
a cultural term for a
phenomena of the universe

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that the universe itself is more
or less a kind of hard disk.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a big memory system.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.933 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
connected to it.

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, if there's
different timelines,

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
do all the timelines get
saved in this memory?

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, basically if you
think about source itself,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
then everything is
stored in there.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
could have happened,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
will happen, has happened,
and will not happen.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And everything beyond that
is as well stored in that.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How would we
know if an event changed

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:90%
in the past or the future?

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: We don't.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Because once it's
done, it's done.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: People don't realize
what that statement is.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what if Hitler won?

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:90%
That big--

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's exactly
what I was thinking

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.370 align:middle line:90%
when we started talking.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Gee whiz.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: But that raises an
interesting other question,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
because why is nobody correcting
that World War, you know?

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Wow.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: True.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And the answer is
there are certain spiritual

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and emotional learning
processes going

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
on that are necessary for
this to be good in the end.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot go and
erase World War II,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
because this is something-- you
could call it a pop cultural

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:90%
term, like karma or something.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:90%
It created conflict.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:90%
It created solutions.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:90%
The need of solutions.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you take that
away, then humanity

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:84%
loses a lot of its
learning process.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Wow.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what do
you think about CERN?

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:90%
What is going on over there.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I'm
suspicious with them.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:90%
They've got power and money.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:90%
A lot of equipment.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:90%
A lot of power.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:10%
And they're risk takers.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
They could be pushing
that envelope.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:84%
They may be pushing
in time travel.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness,
like I said earlier,

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:90%
it's a localized problem.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if they just want
to mess up their timeline,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:90%
then go right ahead.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Just don't bother us.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But they may be heading
in that direction,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
because the very first thing I
said I would do is cyclotron.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
thing come to mind.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And what do they got?

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
The biggest cyclotron
on the planet.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think they're
thinking in that direction.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When beings master
time travel and travel

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
around changing
time, creating chaos,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
is that going to affect
the future timeline?

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And will we know about that?

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Excellent question.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:84%
You better hope you have
a temporal police that

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
know how to chase people
down like that or beings that

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
stop them before they
cause something so bad

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:90%
that all the time lines go.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I believe there is
something like that in place.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the worst
thing that could happen

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
is if there are things done
in a previous time, which

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:90%
means way back.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Cover it in such a
way that it seems

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to be a natural occurring
or a self-governing process.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Which means basically
what I indicate

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that as humanity has done
some really stupid decisions

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.220 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And the question here is,
did they do it themselves?

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And probably not.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So that is how you create
chaos in the timeline.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the question--
and you asked

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:84%
about a time police, which there
is or at least some species

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:90%
dedicate themselves to this.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
They have to figure out things
that happened in the past--

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
is this a decision that a
species has done to themselves,

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:84%
or is this something
that someone covertly

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:90%
has influenced at that time?

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:90%
And is there a right to it?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Because who came first?

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Is it the species
with the time travel,

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
or is this the natural
development of time?

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there any
correlations between time

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
travel and
interdimensional travel?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Time travel is
inter-dimensional travel.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Because what is a dimension?

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
A dimension is just a way
to triangulate your position

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you take time as
another dimension to it,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:84%
you have two points
that add to that.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So basically if
you move yourself

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:84%
between one time
to another time,

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
you've basically done
inter-dimensional travel.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So when beings
master time travel,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
what happens if they have
their own selfish agenda

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that they want to go change or
influence something of time?

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Are species creating
chaos by time travel?

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
The answer's yes, because
there are so many species that

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:90%
have different agendas.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:90%
As we talked about, policing.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
We've also learned
that there are

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
some sets of laws that
species use in order

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to determine if a modification
in a timeline is correct

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Better species try to influence
timelines as less as possible.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Those who are a little
controversial with timelines,

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:84%
they use their capabilities in
order to create as much chaos

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
in a potentially
cloaked and covert way.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So basically those species
that are overseeing timelines,

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:84%
they always question
if what happened

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:84%
happened naturally out of
itself, or has someone--

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
in Germany you would say
put a flea into your ear?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you'd
say that in English.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Which means--

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I wouldn't want that.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, right.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Like influencing
someone and saying,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
hey, you could go over there
and give them some guns.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Would be nice.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.907 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what turns out.

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think we're
definitely all in agreement

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:90%
that it is possible.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But what's the
likelihood that's going

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:90%
to happen in this lifetime?

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Unless they're
already doing it, pretty slim.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is that?

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's because of
the basic infrastructure

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:90%
you would need.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And infrastructure for time
travel just really don't exist.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:10%
If it did, we would have
structured classes on it.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:10%


00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:10%
In our universities, we'd be
teaching and putting degrees

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:10%
into it.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So you could
manipulate and use it.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:84%
At best, right now, it's
just all theoretical.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do you think, Tim?

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:90%
What's the likelihood here?

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: From what I've
observed from humanity,

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that whenever
there's a great technology

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
with some advantages
to some thing,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:90%
groups try to hold it back.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not that humanity
shares well enough.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.465 align:middle line:90%
It should.

00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well,
the talk out there

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:84%
is we're at this high point
of acceleration in time.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a possibility
of bifurcation

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:84%
of timelines with consciousness
and unconscious being.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that's possible?

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, because it
would be a consciousness that

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:10%
would dictate which
way you're going

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:10%
in your timeline for
good effect, bad effect.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:84%
For personal gain,
not personal gain.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Altruistic and whatever
you want to be.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, consciousness
definitely

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%
would be determining how
you apply the science.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I see that
happening in the world today.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Every day I see more and
more consciousness movement

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:90%
and activity.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: And which,
it really seems to be

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.430 align:middle line:10%
accelerating quickly.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:84%
If it did bifurcate, we
wouldn't even know, would we?

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: No, because the
way humans perceive time,

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
it's a lineal,
logical structure.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
It's basically where you see
some glitches in time when

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
timelines get reintegrated
into the time string

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't make quite sense.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So you find double information
that contradicts itself,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have stories about
the past that do not fit in.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:90%
They are paradoxes, for example.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I've stood pretty close to one
of the most experienced life

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:90%
forms in the universe.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And even they don't have the
capability to exactly influence

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
temporal dimensions on point,
which is because if you throw

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
an impulse into the
temporal dimension,

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
it's more or less like
the surface of water.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
It creates certain
temporal ripples that get

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
reflected by all those other
timelines and decisions

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:90%
that's been made.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really determine
what's the result of that.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If you could hit
a button and time travel,

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
David, what would
you go back and do?

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: God,
whatever you would do

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:84%
would have massive
repercussions.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I'll go back
and stop the assassination

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:90%
of John F. Kennedy.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.315 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a good one.

00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Imagine
what that would do.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:90%
It could go either way.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
You can have race
wars and everything

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:90%
going terribly wrong.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Or it would be a fabulous event.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you pick, you'd
have to weigh it out,

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.255 align:middle line:84%
because there would be
guaranteed consequences.

00:25:33.255 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You might not come
back to the same place.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.923 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:25:36.923 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know which
way it's going to go.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It could blow up in your
face or blow up behind you

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and push you
through a good door.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:90%
But you don't know.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.015 align:middle line:90%
It's a roll of the dice.

00:25:47.015 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, yeah.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I
would do anything.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I would just observe.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.560 align:middle line:90%
How about you, Tim?

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: You would just observe?

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, just observe.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Wow.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating
question, because you

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:90%
could go really far back.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, what
would you do then?

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So quite often, I'm thinking
about if I had the chance

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and could go back to
the 1930s and just

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:84%
have a history book and show
someone in the right chancery--

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Books.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.928 align:middle line:90%
A good idea.

00:26:22.928 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, and not to
win the war or something.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Just to show what's
happening with Germany.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
He might see what's
happening in the world.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:84%
After that, it hopefully stops
immediately all sorts of war

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I hope.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do any of you believe
that you have time traveled out

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.270 align:middle line:90%
of this reality?

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I haven't
had any evidence.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Ironically, you.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I've never had that
case that's so strong,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:90%
stepping out in the hallway.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Turn around and meet somebody
you've never met before,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and you got recall.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:90%
All this memory.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
what is that about?

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've never ran
into that before.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Not like that.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Man, I knew you.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
You could tell by
my face I knew you.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I know.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.835 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it's like,
man, what's going on?

00:27:19.835 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I've never met this guy.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:90%
But I had recall.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.746 align:middle line:90%
Not like you owed me money.

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:28.598 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:28.598 --> 00:27:29.398 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:84%
It was good ventures,
whatever it was.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're tapped
into multiple timelines.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I guess.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And
dimensions that you--

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That
would explain that,

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.108 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing else
that would explain that.

00:27:41.108 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it wasn't just,
oh, he reminds me of somebody.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:84%
No, it's like an old
friend with, yeah, it's

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
an old friend and recall.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:90%
You're recalling it.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:10%
And like, whoa, that was
a real reality somewhere.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:10%
I've never had
that happen before.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:84%
It just came right
out of the blue.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Last thing on my mind.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Beautiful.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How about you, Tim?

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I
don't feel right--

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel completely
integrated in this reality, so.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You got one
foot in, one foot out.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I don't think
it's possible to not

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
be time traveling as long
as you are inside of time.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So I completely cannot integrate
the thought of no time travel,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:84%
where you're actually moving
towards time literally every

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
second, every moment.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: He brought something
really interesting about--

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think of it
applied to time travel.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:10%
But I never felt I have ever--

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:10%
I've never been
at home anywhere.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere at any
time my entire life.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:10%
And I never thought that
could be due to time travel.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Who would know?

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
whenever I'm sat in a room

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
with people and a house, in
various homes, nice places,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I never feel at home.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:10%
You know when people say, oh,
I'm right where I should be.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:90%
This is home.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'll sit there, god,
I wish I could say that.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt at home
on this planet, ever.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well that's why
since you were young,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:84%
you've been building
rockets to get--

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I guess--

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: GTF out.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.818 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Trying to
get out of here.

00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was with
my family, they never

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:90%
felt like they were family.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
They were great to me.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:90%
I got along.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:90%
They loved me, I loved them.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Did things.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Had a good relationship.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Had a good family.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:90%
But they never felt like family.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I always thought, my
family's somewhere else.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't seen
them in a lifetime.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It'd sure be nice to
meet up with them again.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And you know
what Being Six said?

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
It said the whole
reason why we all

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.580 align:middle line:84%
have this from
their perspectives

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:90%
is that we find home.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:84%
That we find the
feeling of home.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Every particle, every
consciousness unit

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:84%
of everything, needs
to rearrange itself

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:29.200 align:middle line:84%
until it's in that feeling
of, wow, I'm so at home.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And once that's done, the
universe knows how it looks.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Wow.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.050 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.520 align:middle line:84%
In our community,
I've had people

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:84%
come up and tell me, oh,
you chose to come here.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I'm going
to tell you how it happened.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:10%
I lost a bet.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm paying it off.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm paying it off by
being here in this place.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.280 align:middle line:90%
And it was a terrible bet.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So I'll pay up.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.660 align:middle line:84%
But do you think I
asked to come here?

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:84%
You're out of your
friggin' mind.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There's no way I
asked to come to a place like--

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I lost a bet.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.162 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what possessed
me to make a bet like that.

00:31:07.162 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to make the best
out of it and do what I can

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and try to leave the
place better off than when

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I found it.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good way
to approach it, I guess.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Tim and I just
saw you getting in the cab,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:90%
so we just jumped in with you.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Next time, you can pick
that blue planet, the big water

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.830 align:middle line:84%
one with the mermaids and
mermans running around.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Or somewhere a little bit
less hostile and greedy.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Exactly.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But this place
here, man, this is a planet--

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:90%
this is a school of hard knocks.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It is.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: This is it.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's a big
educational process.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.578 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Oh, man,
people, if that's

00:31:40.578 --> 00:31:42.730 align:middle line:84%
what you were looking
for, you've got it.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.340 align:middle line:90%
You made it.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And that makes it so
interesting to all the ETs.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Because that creates a high
evolutionary potential.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Agree with that.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you come out of here, you
will be evolved or devolved.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.290 align:middle line:84%
But something will
happen to you.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And lot of problems make
lots of room for solutions.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.172 align:middle line:84%
And that creates
diversity again, you know?

00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And you don't
interact with this world

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.060 align:middle line:90%
without repercussions.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it sticks
to you like glue.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So you better make
the best of it.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, guys,
that was a great episode.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.835 align:middle line:84%
I can't thank you more
enough for being here, David.

00:32:23.835 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: My pleasure.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And Tim, it's always
a pleasure to have you here.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.490 align:middle line:10%
>>FEMALE VOICEOVER: Next
on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.948 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where do you guys
see the UAP narrative going?

00:32:37.948 --> 00:32:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I think they're
really concerned they're

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.908 align:middle line:90%
about to get busted.

00:32:41.908 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get caught
in one of the biggest

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.990 align:middle line:90%
lies in world history.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:49.538 align:middle line:84%
And when it starts unraveling,
it's going to keep going.

00:32:49.538 --> 00:32:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: But what's interesting
is when you mention corruption,

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.195 align:middle line:84%
some of these species
don't even have an idea

00:32:54.195 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:90%
or a concept of corruption.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They're
going to get it.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.290 align:middle line:90%

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That is true.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Next thing
you know, we're

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.445 align:middle line:84%
going to know about
people on the moon.
