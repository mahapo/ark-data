00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on
"Cosmic Disclosure," we

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:90%
have Sergeant Clifford Stone.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Today he's going to be
taking us to Southeast Asia

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:84%
to tell us his experiences
with extraterrestrials

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and their craft.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Stone, welcome
to the show again.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.725 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD STONE:
Thank you, sir.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It's my great
privilege to be here.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sarge, you were
in some crash retrievals

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:90%
in Southeast Asia.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell me about that?

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, actually,
we were involved

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
with actually recovering
a B-52 there in Cambodia,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:84%
only we didn't know
it at the time.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And what really went
on at Nui Ba Den, where

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
we went into the
mountain, I have no idea

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
what that was all about.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But both of them
involved our visitors.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You saw
extraterrestrials there

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:90%
at the site?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I was to later learn that we
did in fact have UFOs, which

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
everyone is directed do not
use the term "UFOs," do not use

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:90%
the term "extraterrestrial."

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
We would refer to
the UFOs that we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
were seeing as enemy helicopters
or unidentified aircraft.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
That was very hard for
particularly the people

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:90%
who worked the radar.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Very simply put, on radar,
they have what's called an RCS,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
radar cross-section.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can pretty much tell
even what type of aircraft

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:90%
you're picking up.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:10%
When you had these blimps or
the RCSes that were showing up,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:10%
they were totally unidentifiable
as to what type of craft

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:10%
they might be.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that part of the
cover-up for these people

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.703 align:middle line:84%
is saying that the special craft
was a helicopter, so no one ask

00:01:54.703 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:90%
us any more questions?

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the entire
purpose behind that,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:84%
it's to make it to where,
oh, it was just a helicopter,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
oh, it was just a
plane flying over.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't know whether
it was Army, Air Force,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Vietnamese, or the Thai.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.312 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't gone to Vietnam.

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I was still at
Fort Lee, Virginia.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
They came in and said, OK,
we're going to go ahead,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to do a field
training exercise in Florida,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be
using selected individuals

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
from various units
here at Fort Lee.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So there was me and another
person by the name of Skee.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:90%
He was Air Police at the time.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
He was with the MPs,
but with our unit.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So we were the only two
from the 36th Civil Affairs.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:90%
So we were selected.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And there were other people.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
No one really knew one
another on the plane.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:90%
So we took off.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And we were flying for
quite a few hours--

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
six, seven hours-- before
we landed to refuel.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knew this
was way too long to go

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:90%
from Virginia to Florida.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But that right there
was just a cover story--

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I know.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: --to get us where we
wouldn't ask any questions.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
But now, when we
landed to refuel,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:84%
one of the soldiers that was
sitting directly behind me

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle line:84%
looked out the window and says,
if this is not Oakland airport,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:90%
I will kiss your hindside.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So with that, the one I
always called the Colonel,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
he pulled out the .45 and
very loudly, very firmly said,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I will personally shoot the
next SOB that opens his mouth

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:90%
and says any questions.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
At this time, you will
close your windows

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:90%
and you won't say anything.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Once we're airborne, I will
go ahead and explain to you

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:90%
what mission we're really on.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You were
on a plane, sir,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
not knowing where you're
going, being threatened--

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --and close those
windows and keep your piehole

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:90%
shut.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very,
very quiet aircraft

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.512 align:middle line:90%
that when it took off--

00:04:09.512 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You could
hear a pin drop.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Even with the engines running.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.565 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So I'm assuming
no one opened their mouth

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the flight.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Mm-mm.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
happens when you landed?

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, before we
landed, they went ahead

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:90%
and they gave us plastic bags.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Then they gave us a razor blade,
a single-edge razor blade.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And Skee, he had
a sense of humor.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
He went ahead, says, you
know what this is all about,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.672 align:middle line:90%
I says, I haven't a clue.

00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:43.755 align:middle line:90%
He says, it's real simple.

00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We're to take the single-edge
razor blade, cut our throats,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.580 align:middle line:90%
and bleed into the plastic bag.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, don't
joke like that.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:90%
You may be right.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.707 align:middle line:90%
Anyhow, we went ahead.

00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the Colonel
went ahead, says,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.558 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's what we're doing.

00:04:58.558 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
We're heading to a country that
is not friendly to the United

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:90%
States government.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:90%
We had a bomber go down.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are going in
to see if there are

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:90%
any survivors on that bomber.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
If they are, we are to go ahead
and call in for helicopters

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
to come pick up the survivors.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Then we are to come on
back to our staging area,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
be picked up by the
helicopters that's

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.472 align:middle line:84%
going to take us to
that staging area,

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be picked up by them,
brought back to the airbase

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that we landed at, get
back on this plane,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and we'll come back
to the United States,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll be debriefed.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Said, but at this
time, I need you

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead, take everything
out of your pockets

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
that might identify
you as an American--

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:84%
wallets, everything,
family pictures.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything has come out.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
After you do that, I want you to
go ahead, take the razor blade,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
where you have US
Army or US Air Force,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
we want you to go
ahead, take that off.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Your name on the other side,
want you to take that off.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Your military patches, such as
your unit patch, your combat

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:90%
patch--

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and we still had the
rank at that time--

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.905 align:middle line:90%
and take the military ranks off.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:16.598 align:middle line:84%
Says, you take all that
off, put it in the bag,

00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
put your name on the bag.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
little sheet that you

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
had that was affixed
to the bag that you

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.315 align:middle line:90%
could write your name on.

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Said, you're going to put it all
in that, and we'll collect it,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and it'll remain on this plane
till you all get back here.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that time,
I didn't realize

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:90%
why we're doing all that.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.502 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was real simple.

00:06:31.502 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
If you got killed,
they could not

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:90%
tie it to the US government.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:90%
So we went ahead and did that.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So who was
on-board and what

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
was it made out of, what
team and names you can maybe

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:90%
give us?

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.402 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: As far as the
people on the plane,

00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
it's always you were not to
know who the other people were.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
The intent was so
you would never

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
get together and make notes.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You'd never get two people
involved in the same situation

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
to where they could go ahead
and say, this happened,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and the other guy could
say, I know it happened,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:90%
because I was there.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is what makes it
very difficult for people

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:84%
to come out and talk and have
confirmation by other people

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:84%
coming out and saying,
yes, I was there.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
On this mission, even
though you didn't

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.810 align:middle line:84%
know who the guy was sitting
next to you-- in my case,

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I did, because he
was from my unit.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:90%
And we sat down together.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite sure if they saw that,
they may have said, no, no, no,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:90%
you guys split up.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:90%
But no one hit us up on it.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
But Skee knew what
his mission was.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
His mission was to go ahead
and provide perimeter security

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
around the craft
once we got there.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:10%
My job was to go ahead,
use radiological equipment

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:10%
to carry the PRC-25, the field
radio telephone, and was also

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:10%
to assist to check to
see if any of the people

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:10%
on-board the craft were
still alive or injured,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:10%
then assist in rendering
first aid as good

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.585 align:middle line:10%
as I could to any
of the survivors.

00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't thinking
about having anything

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to do with trying to communicate
with our visitors or anything

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
like that, because at that
time, I did not know this

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:90%
had anything to do with UFOs.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I should have guessed,
because the guy that I always

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
called the Colonel, he was
the one that was in charge.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
think about that.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I
didn't think about that.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: From my experience,
I would be thrown on a C-130

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.517 align:middle line:84%
with 20, 30 people I'd
never met in my life.

00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
And they make sure it's
that way, of course, so--

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.308 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --nothing
gets slipped up.

00:08:38.308 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But we all knew what
we were supposed to do.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Oh, yeah, I knew
what I supposed to do.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they would
call us and say, hey,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
you got to be at the tarmac
with the go bag in 15 minutes.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.978 align:middle line:84%
So we would get there
and go, and it'd

00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
be a group of people
we did not know.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.205 align:middle line:84%
But in your case, you knew a
couple people that were there.

00:08:55.205 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: I knew one person.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
knew who he was.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But they went ahead, told
us to get off the plane,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:90%
go to the helicopters.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We got to the helicopters.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.322 align:middle line:84%
We flew for, I'm saying,
an hour, maybe better.

00:09:10.322 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
We went to a place
where I now know

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:90%
was Parrot's Beak in Cambodia.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we got there, we had
this little stream that was--

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I used to know the name of the
river, because it was a river.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:90%
We set up a staging area.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the staging
area, you're briefed on,

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to
go over here, I'm

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
going to show you
where the site is.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
At there, you're going to
do A, B, C, D. So we all

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
knew what our mission was
when we got over there.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
We went over, and it looked
like there was a big hole

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:90%
damage to the B-52 up front.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:10%
And it was as though
it was a SAM-7,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:10%
a surface-to-air missile--

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.233 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Surface-to-air missile.

00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: --of Soviet origin that
actually went into the aircraft

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:10%
and killed the people there.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.735 align:middle line:84%
But not everyone
died, because I firmly

00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
believe that they
were trying to fly it

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
back to the airbase from which
they came from, which would

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
have been in
Thailand, and everyone

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
died as a result of their wounds
before that was to happen,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and the plane was
about to crash.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason, some
other higher intelligence

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
took over and had the plane, as
though as some big, giant hand

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
picked it up and set it
down on the jungle floor,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
because the plane was totally
intact except for that one area

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
where it appeared that
the SAM went into it.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was it a craft?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Was it an ET that
helped this craft?

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I think it
was our visitors that

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:84%
set the craft down, because
they wanted to understand

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of what happened
there of that little missile

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:84%
killing everybody
on-board that aircraft.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
While we were there where the
B-52 was, after we accomplished

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:84%
what we were supposed
to accomplish with it,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I saw the B-52.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I felt
the B-52 should be

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:90%
much larger than what it was.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason,
it looked smaller

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
than what I thought
it should have been.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So I slung my M16
over my shoulder,

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going around
looking at the craft.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I go around to the tail
section, looking at it,

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:90%
go around to the other side.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
When I get around
to the other side,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
there in the shrubbery
coming out of it

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:84%
are little gray entities
about 4 foot tall.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:84%
As they came towards me, I'm
looking at them and thought,

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't say anything.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But till the day I
die, I'll remember

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:84%
what the little entity said
to me and the way he said it.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It was like, Clifford,
what are you doing here?

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:90%
You are not supposed to be here.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I got
my M16, pulled it up.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
You normally don't carry your
weapon on full automatic.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I put it on full automatic,
and I started to fire,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.795 align:middle line:90%
and I yelled out, VC, VC.

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
No reason for us
to believe that.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.633 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea why
I was yelling that.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was to alert
the other troops that we

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:84%
were no longer alone, that there
were a number of little guys

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:90%
there, I'll put it that way.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, everyone else
started to shoot.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But our bullets was
having no effect.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
You should see where the
bullets would bounce off of them

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
or where they were
going through them.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
All we saw was the
flash from our weapons.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:90%
This was daylight.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't tell
what was going on.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were other people
witnessing these little beings?

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Oh, yeah, every
soldier there was a witness.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many
beings were there?

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: There were
about 15 or 20.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And normally, you wouldn't
think there'd be that many.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason, they
followed us all the way back

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to that little stream
where you had to cross it,

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:90%
then they stopped.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.967 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you just exhaust
your firepower, and nothing

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
happened, and said, what are
we going to do now, they're

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.133 align:middle line:90%
still looking at us?

00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.127 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:13:13.127 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:90%
But maybe we'd have--

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.597 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What'd
the commander say?

00:13:15.597 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: --to walk back.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't saying anything.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:90%
He was with us going back.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Later on, he just
asked me, do you

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:90%
have any idea what happened?

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a clue.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And once again, I don't have a
clue, Colonel, because that's

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:90%
what I always called him.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But when we got back across
there, he said, OK, look,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
we need to have somebody
go back and make sure

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that everything's all
clear, that we're not

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
going to any more
surprises back there.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:90%
So I need a volunteer.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And I went ahead.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:90%
No one volunteered.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.738 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the point
where I felt I had to know.

00:13:54.738 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I had to know what was
going on back there.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So without saying
anything, I got my M16,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and I got my bandoleer
of ammunition,

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and crossed back over
the little stream.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Then the guy I always called
the Colonel, he says, Stone,

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.932 align:middle line:90%
where are you going?

00:14:12.932 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, you said
you needed to know

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.515 align:middle line:90%
what's going on over there.

00:14:15.515 --> 00:14:18.097 align:middle line:84%
He says, yeah, but I did
not want you to volunteer

00:14:18.097 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:90%
and I don't want you to go back.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.622 align:middle line:84%
I says, Colonel, look, I did
not know what we were really

00:14:22.622 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
coming here for, I didn't
know we'd run into anything

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:90%
like this, but I got to know.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I got to know what's
going on back there.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Something I got to
know, was it these guys

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.665 align:middle line:90%
that brought this down?

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it is these guys
that brought it down,

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
then we have problems.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I says, but I got to know
and I got to find out.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:90%
So I started to go back.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, each
of the other soldiers

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:84%
grabbed their M16,
their bandoleer,

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and started following me.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And the Colonel then last,
but he would have come anyhow

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:90%
if it was just me.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
He went ahead and came on back,
and he crossed over with me--

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:90%
with us, should I say.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%
We went on back.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing there.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:84%
There was some people who
talk about this story,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
say there were big gapping
wounds on the-- no.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
There was wounds that was
consistent with shrapnel

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:90%
from the missile--

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: From the missile.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: --that hit it.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was obvious that
some died instantaneously.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:90%
So we went ahead.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.045 align:middle line:84%
We took the bodies
out of the plane.

00:15:30.045 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we took the
bodies out of the plane,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
we went ahead and put them
on blankets on the ground,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
have any stretchers,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and we called in
for the helicopters

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.017 align:middle line:84%
to come pick them up,
and they picked them up.

00:15:43.017 --> 00:15:45.883 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.883 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And these were
medical helicopters

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:90%
that picked them up.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But they picked them
up, took them on back

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
to process to bring
them back to the States.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.975 align:middle line:84%
When this happened,
we had some engineers

00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
brought in on a helicopter.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Then we had about
four of the Skycranes

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:84%
there, CH-54 helicopters,
which are big utility copters.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Huge.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: The engineers cut
off the wings of the B-52,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:23.930 align:middle line:84%
cut off the tail section,
and each of the CH-54s

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
picked up a wing, the
fuselage, and the tail section,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:90%
and flew them out of there.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
We walked back to
our staging area.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
At our staging
area, we picked up

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
everything we had
back there, trying

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to make it look like
we were never there,

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
got on-board the helicopters
they sent to pick us up.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
By the time we got back,
it was the next night.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We got out of our helicopters,
went to the same plane

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that we came in
on, and took off.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they went
ahead and debriefed us,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
telling us, OK,
here's what happened.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Enemy fire brought
down the B-52.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it
went down in a country

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:84%
that was not friendly to the
United States government.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
We went in as a
recovery team to recover

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
any survivors that
may have survived

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:90%
the crash of that B-52.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:84%
This is the cover
story we are going

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to be releasing to the media,
to the public at large,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
if this becomes public that
this incident occurred.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, this incident never
occurred, nothing happened,

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and you were never, ever here.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
If you say you were
here, if you repeat

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
the story of this
incident, we can

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:90%
prove that you were never here.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What happened
to the extraterrestrials?

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Was that the last
time you see them?

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.625 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah, that was it.

00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And did your
commander comment

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:90%
on the extraterrestrials?

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: [LAUGHS] Yeah,
but he was guessing,

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.638 align:middle line:90%
I think, too, same as I was.

00:17:55.638 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You're in shock.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everyone was.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yeah, I didn't plan on
anything like that to be there.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.737 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did the
extraterrestrials

00:18:00.737 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:90%
have clothing?

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They had the one piece,
almost skintight clothing.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like the
clothes breathed with them.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was to cover up their
modesty, as I always said.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But I was trying to figure
out how do they even

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
get into these, because
there were no zippers.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Nope.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They went
around up to the neck.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
How the heck do
they get into them?

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.553 align:middle line:84%
I never got to see
if they stretched

00:18:27.553 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't about to
go, do you care

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:90%
if I see if this stretches any?

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I never did anything like that.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's unlike you
to bring out your gun

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:90%
and start shooting ETs.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, this was
one of my first experiences

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.310 align:middle line:84%
with them being in
a hostile situation.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was unsure what was really
going on there, and the fact

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that they were
calling me by name

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and asking why I was there.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe the
medical problems I

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
had to keep me out
of the military,

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:90%
maybe it was by design by them.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But because I love
my country and I

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
felt that I had a
moral obligation--

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:84%
because I believed
that my country could

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:84%
do no wrong, that
if we were fighting

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
a war in Vietnam, that they were
getting their orders directly

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:90%
from God.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it was the old adage
of God, mom, and apple pie.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So I had a moral obligation
to serve my country.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.588 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think every young
soldier feels this way.

00:19:33.588 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: But I knew there
were a lot of people fighting

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
against the war
that didn't think

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:90%
it was right and all that.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted in.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But who were they to come
out to tell me I'm not

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:90%
supposed-- what was going on?

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And a million different mixed
up thoughts just running

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:90%
through my head at the time.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
when we went back, I

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:84%
didn't know whether we were
going to be confronting weapons

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that was going to end our
existence on this Earth above

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and beyond anything we'd ever
seen before, whether they were

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:90%
hostile toward us, whether--

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:84%
did they really bring
down this craft,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
which I was praying to God
they had nothing to do with.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And I felt in my heart they
didn't, because I already

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:90%
saw where the craft was hit.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:84%
It was consistent
with a SAM hitting it.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I saw the wounds on the
airmen that were killed,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.602 align:middle line:84%
and those were consistent
with shrapnel wounds.

00:20:31.602 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'd already
seen some of those,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
because we don't cut out
the parts of training films

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:90%
that might be bad to show.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
You were to get the gore of
war from the training films.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.155 align:middle line:84%
You were being trained so,
when you got over there,

00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
you would do
everything you could

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to minimize your
mistakes, so you would

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:90%
survive and get to come home.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But I knew what
I was looking at.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this wasn't
some exotic weapon that

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:90%
brought this plane down.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I
didn't understand

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
was how did it just set
down on the jungle floor.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
I couldn't understand.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And once this happened, I knew
we were in a hostile country.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there was not a
debris field going into this?

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: No debris field.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
There were no-- any of the
treetops that were lopped off

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:90%
as the plane came in.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like that at all.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that was
the situation there.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I would not know
that it was Vietnam

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:90%
till I was assigned to Vietnam.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The first place I landed coming
into Vietnam was Bien Hoa.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I would not know
till later on when

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:90%
we weren't going into Vietnam.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Officially, we
went into Cambodia.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
We went in, and I remembered
some of the areas around there.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.495 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, I know
you have some experience

00:21:59.495 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:90%
with the tunnels over there.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate for the
audience what you experienced?

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: There was one
time that I went ahead.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And we won't go into detail why
I would go off post at night.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd go, and people say,
oh, oh, you can't do that.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, you can.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And the troops there knew
why I was going out that way,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
but I could go out undetected
in our own kill zone.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.290 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:90%
But anyhow, I went out.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And the place I went out was
real close to this rubber

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.942 align:middle line:90%
plantation.

00:22:30.942 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, when I went
out that night,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.983 align:middle line:84%
there's this helicopter
sitting there.

00:22:33.983 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, OK,
what the heck is this?

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And the same guy I always
called the Colonel,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.017 align:middle line:84%
he went ahead and told
me, he said, you're late.

00:22:41.017 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
We've been waiting
20 minutes for you.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.558 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, I'm late?

00:22:43.558 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
How the heck did you even
know I was coming out here?

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But anyhow, he said,
you're to go with us.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, OK, what
are we going to be doing?

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:90%
He knows what I'm out here for.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:90%
So we go ahead, we take off.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:84%
When we take off, he says,
we're going to Nui Ba Den.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And there at Tay Ninh, they
have this big mountain.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And most people hear
of it as Nui Ba Den.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
That translates to the
Black Virgin Mountain.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:84%
We went, I'd say, roughly in
the center of the mountain.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
We landed there, and there's
this big, huge open-- big cave.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And we were wondering, OK,
what are we doing here?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.285 align:middle line:84%
Well, they decided that we
were going to go from there

00:23:24.285 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to go back.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's other
troops already there.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.610 align:middle line:90%
So we start to go into the cave.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.145 align:middle line:90%
We take a PRC-25 with us.

00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And we start going back.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:84%
As we get further
and further back,

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:84%
it gets more difficult
to use the radio.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So we dropped the radio off with
a person there with the radio.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Then we'd do relays.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So if we had to get
radio messages out,

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
we'd send a soldier back to
say, OK, send this message out.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:90%
But we continued to go back.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
We continued to go back,
the entrance got smaller,

00:23:54.610 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
then it opened up into this
big cavern, huge place,

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:84%
which looked like some type
of laboratory of some sort.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And we got in there.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't see no
lights like we have here.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:90%
But it was lit.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:90%
It was well-lit.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to explain
how it looked.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a luminescent
black and white scene.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like bioluminescent?

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Was it glowing?

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't really
glowing, but that

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
was the impression you got,
because this is at night.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:84%
There's no moonlight
coming in, nothing.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Then we looked out on one side,
and we saw some of the soldiers

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:84%
on the outside that was on the
other side of where we were,

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and it looked like they
were walking on air.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.235 align:middle line:84%
And the guy I always
called the Colonel says,

00:24:48.235 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:90%
can you explain that?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't know
what type of technology

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
the NVA could have
that's doing this.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I says, why do they
need a laboratory here?

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:84%
He says, so you
think this is NVA?

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, this is Vietnam, right?

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
He says, yes, yes, but
we need to find out

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.650 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Make a couple points
clear about seeing them

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:90%
like they were walking in air.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
We actually sent message
out and told them,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
can you folks go ahead,
take your entrenching tools,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and just take one or
two scoops of earth,

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
and dig, and see what happens.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, we could see them
put their entrenching tools

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:90%
on what seemed like air.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
When they brought them up and
threw them over their shoulder,

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
there was earth on
them, there was dirt.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:84%
When they landed back into the
earth, they simply disappeared.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So we had no idea what
we were looking at.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was like
somehow, some way, there

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
was some type of
technology there

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that would let us see through
the side of the mountain

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:84%
to where it appeared
that it was just

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:90%
like a big window of some sort.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, once
again, a typical Gray

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:90%
started to show up.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And when they started to show
up, no words were uttered.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But immediately,
the other soldiers,

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:84%
without even being told
to, they started to fire.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Once that happened,
it was like you

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.450 align:middle line:84%
could hold your hand that
close in front of you,

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:90%
you would not be able to see it.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's yelling,
cease fire, cease fire.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, I got a
pain in my head in my left eye.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And I went down.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
last I remembered.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You were shot?

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: No.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up, I'm
outside of the cave.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the Colonel,
how did I get out here?

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
How did you guys
get me out here?

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
He said, we didn't.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea how
you got out here.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, you patched my eye up.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Says, well, yeah, but
you were unconscious.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh?

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:84%
He says, yes, but there
was a patch over your eye

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:90%
when you got out here.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered that
there was this voice

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
while I was still in a semi
state of a coma that said,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
if we don't take
care of his eye,

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:84%
he will lose the
sight in the left eye.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was the last
thing I remembered.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And my medical records reflect
that a bug sprayed a spray

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
into my eye that like a surgical
instrument cut the cornea out

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.640 align:middle line:90%
or the retina of the eye.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
It took almost two weeks
for it to go ahead and heal.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.895 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was this a craft in
this cave system or was it

00:27:40.895 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
really just a built-out
laboratory that

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials--

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: To the best of my
knowledge, it wasn't a craft,

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
but I can't say it wasn't,
because the whole situation is

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:84%
several days after that,
the cave no longer existed.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:84%
The big cavern under
there no longer existed.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:90%
And the way it was put--

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:90%
there was never a cave there.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
There was never
an opening there.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:90%
We never went there.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But we had an officially
sanctioned deception story.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Should anyone ever find out
that an incident happened there,

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that it was the communists
that had a laboratory there.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
They were going to use
germ warfare on us.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.793 align:middle line:84%
They were working on
the bubonic plague

00:28:23.793 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to go ahead and try

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.918 align:middle line:84%
to introduce to the
American armed forces there.

00:28:29.918 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:84%
But then they
concluded that it would

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.920 align:middle line:84%
hurt some of their people, too,
a whole lot of their people,

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and it may create an
epidemic there in Vietnam

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that they may not
be able to control,

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
so they went ahead and
decided not to do it.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, the story never got out.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have to
use the cover story.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.690 align:middle line:84%
However, many people
knew of the cover story.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So there at Tay Ninh base
camp, a lot of people

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.790 align:middle line:84%
were talking about that, and it
became that it was a VC camp.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, elements of the
25th Infantry and elements

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of a couple of the special
forces troops that were there

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
went ahead and
went looking for it

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and could never find it,
even though it was clear

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:90%
exactly where it was.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do
you think happened?

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: I don't know.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Here, again, I do know that
they can go ahead and displace

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:90%
time-space.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.060 align:middle line:84%
They could go ahead
through a solid wall.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.130 align:middle line:84%
They can come
through it, and just

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:84%
like what we'd say a ghost
walking through a wall.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But this is technology.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:90%
This isn't supernatural.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And possibly there in
that particular area,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
they had a craft there, and
that's what we were seeing.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But here, again, they were
displacing time-space.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:90%
So the mountain was still there.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
There was no digging
out of the mountain.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:90%
The opening was there.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure the
opening was there for a reason,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
necessarily have

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to have that opening
if that was the case.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole lot
of questions to which we

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:90%
have no answers for.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And until the governments of
the world-- not just the US

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.360 align:middle line:84%
government, but the
governments of the world

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:84%
start talking about the fact
that UFOs are a reality,

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:29.947 align:middle line:84%
they're here, and starts
telling the people,

00:30:29.947 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:84%
here are some of the
things that we do

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.910 align:middle line:84%
know, and we can have
an open dialogue--

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:90%
they might be surprised.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:84%
There may be people in
the civilian sector that

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.180 align:middle line:84%
know a whole lot more
about our visitors

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.090 align:middle line:84%
than any government on the
face of this world knows.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But until there is that
confirmation from authority

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that, one, they're
real, they're here,

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and there's
interaction going on,

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and we really have
nothing to fear--

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
because to date, we
have no indication

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
of them being hostile.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Till that happens, people
who may know a whole lot more

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:90%
aren't talking.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned a
couple different incidences

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:90%
of species, mostly Grays.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
it's these Grays?

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: Well, first
of all, we identified

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:10%
three types of Grays.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:10%
The other thing is that
they may be more active

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:10%
in some of this
stuff, particularly

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.180 align:middle line:10%
than what the others are.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:32.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you have where
they are just like pure energy

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.440 align:middle line:84%
entities, well, people may
identify those as supernatural,

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:90%
ghosts, things of this sort.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they get
thrown to the side.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Other of the entities look
very much like us, like humans.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So we might go ahead and
decide, well, you know what?

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.808 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
is weird, but very human,

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:90%
because these people are human.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.187 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.187 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But the Grays, for whatever
reason, are very, very--

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.710 align:middle line:90%
how do I put this?

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say nosy.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Very curious.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's probably why.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.250 align:middle line:10%
But the whole situation
is, like the one

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:21.510 align:middle line:10%
that I have contact with,
people want me to say he's gray.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.370 align:middle line:10%
I wish I could.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:10%
He's green.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.400 align:middle line:10%
They want me to say
he's about 4 foot tall.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:10%
Wish I could.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.330 align:middle line:10%
But he's about 5 foot
tall, a little over.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Very few of them are reported.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But I'm happy to say that in
my search for certain things,

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I found out other people have
seen the green types also.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.115 align:middle line:84%
And I always worry,
what happens?

00:32:45.115 --> 00:32:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Do they get you?

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, no,
we have a means where

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:90%
we're never going to be caught.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.285 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to take
us and hold us as prisoners.

00:32:55.285 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they're
going to know about us

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:84%
is what we tell them
what they want to know.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Says, now we need to
make it clear to you

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that we are not hostile.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:84%
We are interested
in learning as much

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:84%
about your world civilization
as possible, because we want

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
to find everything good and
try to help you hopefully

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.230 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate all the things
that are evil in this world,

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:84%
but not come in and
force it upon you,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:84%
but make it to where
this is your decision

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and this is where you
want to go as a species.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, like I say,
there are many things

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't have answers for.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.770 align:middle line:84%
These are a couple of the
incidences that happened to me.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:84%
There are now
documents that exist,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that were just released
here about two years ago,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:90%
talking about UFOs in Vietnam.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:84%
That's how I know about the
meeting that took place there

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:84%
at MACV headquarters
in June 30, 1968.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how I know that
the Air Force and the Army

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
was trying to make efforts,
particularly in II Corps area,

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of the UFOs that
was being picked

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:90%
up there on a nightly basis.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:17.030 align:middle line:10%
Up around the DMZ, the UFOs
that were being picked up there,

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.340 align:middle line:10%
that were mentioned in the
documents that have surfaced,

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:10%
we were making every effort
to identify these objects.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It makes it clear
that they were told

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
not to go ahead and
call these UFOS,

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:84%
but to call them
enemy helicopters

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:90%
or unidentified aircraft.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It makes it clear, we were never
able to identify these objects.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It makes it clear
that they never gave

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:90%
any sign of hostile intent.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
The UFOs stayed with us all
the way to the end of the war.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:10%
General Brown, I
think it was in '73,

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:10%
was asked, what can
you tell us about UFOs

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.200 align:middle line:10%
at a news conference.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
General Brown said, we
didn't call them UFOs then.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.410 align:middle line:84%
We called them
enemy helicopters.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.100 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we stopped-- we
started to ignore them,

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and the problem went away.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The sightings didn't go
away, but we no longer

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:90%
perceived them as a threat.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But the reports
were still there.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
the requirement in Vietnam

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
was that units made a
monthly report of the number

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.970 align:middle line:90%
of sightings of UFOs.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know how
many sightings were reported?

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It was numbering
into the thousands.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, once again, that
information, it was classified,

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:90%
but it's never destroyed.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:90%
That is never released.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Also, the documentation
that has been released

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:84%
makes it clear that there are
higher classified documents

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:84%
than what was released,
that to this day

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:middle line:90%
have not been released.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to start
asking the government,

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.910 align:middle line:84%
look, you have this stuff
about Vietnam classified

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:84%
at a secret level or higher,
the American public have a right

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.290 align:middle line:90%
to know.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And that hasn't happened yet.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there anything
that you learned in Vietnam

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:84%
from these extraterrestrials
that you took home with you?

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, from the
experiences I had in Vietnam

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and the things that I learned
that I could go ahead and put

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
in my memoirs, so to speak, is
that they were very much trying

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to understand how a race
of people, a race of beings

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:84%
such as us, capable of so much
good, helping one another,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.280 align:middle line:84%
making this a much better world
to live in, how we could be

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:09.440 align:middle line:84%
also of such a nature that we
could kill innocent people,

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:84%
literally murder in the name
of war, in the name of glory.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And they can't understand war.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And horrible things
happened in Vietnam.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And I witnessed a
whole lot of that.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And the situation is
they witnessed it.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying
to understand why.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that I took away

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and I think the rest
world needs to think about

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:84%
is that little, what,
one or two sentences

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that here we are,
a species capable

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:53.720 align:middle line:90%
of such good, honorable things.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we can be
the same creature that

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
can be capable of such horrific
things that we do in war?
