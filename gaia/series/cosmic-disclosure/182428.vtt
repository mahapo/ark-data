00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.360 align:middle line:90%
My name is Jay Weidner.

You're watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

And we are back with Jason Rice.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:10%
How you doing?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: I'm
doing great, Jay.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:10%
Thank you again for having me.

>>JAY: Since your
last appearances here,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
have you had any memories
return of any other things that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:84%
happened to you while you were
up in the Secret Space Program?

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There have been a number
of memories that have returned.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the instances
in which I'd recalled

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
was a shuttle explosion
on the launch pad.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:90%
It was on Callidus 3.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And during their
rebuilding efforts,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:84%
part of the problems
that started coming back

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
was that there were
a certain number

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
of the humanoid population there
that were not happy with how

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:90%
things were going.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
They were not happy
with the centralization

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of all of their
civilization into cities,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
giving up their old lifestyles
and the way that they'd lived.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And so a certain rebellion had
started amongst the citizens.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
able to do was

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
infiltrate the spaceport

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and create an explosion
in the power cells

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:90%
on one of the shuttles.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And the result was a series
of very, very large antimatter

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:90%
explosions.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
The first one that
went off destroyed

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the shuttle and
everything around it,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:84%
including some of the shuttles
next to it that were on the pad

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The containment systems that
were holding those power cells,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:84%
which were the
antimatter containment,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
started degrading
and also failed,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
which resulted in
more explosions.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And the whole process
lasted about 30 minutes

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:84%
from the first explosion
to the last one.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was showing up
to work because I was working

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:90%
for the local government.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were responsible for
helping the locals consolidate

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
their control and get
information to the people,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:84%
to the citizens, so that the
citizens could be involved

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
in the governing, so that
they would know where

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and what they needed
to do, because we

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
had a centralized work
program for people

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
so that they would all be
involved with the rebuilding

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of that
related to getting

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
rid of some of the fraud
that was starting to show up,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
in which people were, again,
black marketing certain items

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
or certain technologies.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were these
shuttles IDARF shuttles?

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, they were shuttles
that belonged to Callidus 3,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and they were
responsible for moving

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
people and goods from the planet
to the new orbital station.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
The rebels, what they
were trying to do

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
is they were trying to
make their voices heard

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and destroy the move
towards a space society.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that, I
guess, what they could do

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:90%
is destroy the shuttle port.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, they
would end the process.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Well of course, that's
not the way it worked.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How did
the rebellion end?

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, this particular
day, I'd shown up for work,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and we were on the
outskirts of town.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And myself and my
partner, a staff sergeant

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
had an office
right next to mine.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
We heard the first
explosion and felt it.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I got
up out of my chair,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:90%
walked into the hallway.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And little known to
me, but the sergeant

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
in the office next door had
done the exact same thing.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So to an outside
observer, it would

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
have appeared that we'd been
choreographed because we

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
both arrived in the hall
and both made a right turn

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
towards the exit
at the same time.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
Went out to the vehicle
that had been assigned

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
to us, which was an
electrogravitic ground car,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and it was a troop carrier
that we were using for whatever

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:90%
we needed to travel around.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
He climbed into the
back, because the SOP was

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:84%
if we felt that we
were under attack,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
we were to report in and
try and consolidate back

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
at the headquarters,
which happened

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:90%
to be at the spaceport.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So he crawled into the
turret that was at the back

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and manned that while I drove
the vehicle the 15 or 20

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:90%
minutes over to the airport.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was another explosion
that had occurred on the way.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were going
towards the explosions?

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We were going
towards the explosions,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.167 align:middle line:84%
because, well, that's
where the base was

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:90%
and that's our rally point.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And along the way,
we came to a point

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:84%
where we were close to the
border of the spaceport,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and another shuttle had
set down on the broadway

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:90%
that we were using as a road.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It was an opening
essentially that

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.075 align:middle line:84%
was large enough for vehicles
to move in either direction.

00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
It was grassed over.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And had set down there
because it wasn't safe

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.340 align:middle line:84%
for it to be in the air
because of the concussion waves

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:90%
from the explosions.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And I had
heard over the radio

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that I was to meet up with
the shuttle and pick up a VIP

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and bring her with me to the HQ.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled up next
to the shuttle,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
got out, and went
through the entrance

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
to the shuttle, which was
an airlock, went inside.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got
to the control room,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:90%
there was another explosion.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And we were close
enough that the shuttle,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
if it had not been
locked to the ground,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
that it obviously would
have moved it around.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But it had its
shields protecting it.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
The problem was that
where I had parked,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle was in a shadow,
blast shadow, most of it,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:90%
from the shuttle.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
The part that was not
in the blast shadow

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
happened to be the turret
where the Sergeant was sitting.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched, I witnessed
the rear end of the APC

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
get destroyed and watched my
partner die in the process.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What's APC?

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Armored
Personnel Carrier.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I saw
that happen and went

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
through the full
range of emotions of

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
should I have done more,
could I have done more,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and being completely enraged
by just watching it and being

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
helpless, completely helpless,
with what was going on.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So how many people died?

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were a number of
deaths on the spaceport itself,

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:90%
between 50 and 100.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This have any
effect on the rebellion?

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It brought
a greater force

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
to bear on rooting them out
and destroying the rebellion.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And who did that?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: By this time,
the civilian authorities

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:84%
had established their own police
department and security forces.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones that
routed them out and found them

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and tried them and
convicted them.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.238 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the
rebellion was ended?

00:07:34.238 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The rebellion
was ended eventually.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't overnight.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
It took a matter of
another year or so

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.328 align:middle line:84%
before it was
completely finished.

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But there were those among
the population that were not

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
happy with the direction that
the civilization had turned

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and the direction
they were going into.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: When you
arrived on Planet 2,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:90%
it was a low-tech civilization.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But now you're describing
anti-gravitic cars

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of weapons.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, spaceport.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Spaceport.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Space shuttles, yeah.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So what's going on?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.728 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: At the
start of the war, we

00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
weren't allowed to share
advanced technologies.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
war, when we left,

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:90%
that policy was still in place.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
In the intermittent time that
I was redeployed to Planet 3,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
was there for 15 months,
was injured, and was then

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
transferred back to
a medical facility

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to go through healing,
repair, and rehab,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
after departing that
medical facility,

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I returned to Callidus 3.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
And when I returned there
to help with the rebuilding

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
efforts, the policy of
sharing technologies

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:90%
had completely disappeared.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And they were now interested
in moving the civilization

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as possible towards a
space-faring technological race

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as possible, which
included moving facilities

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:84%
into space, giving them a
space platform in which they

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:84%
could operate, sharing with
them advanced technologies.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The APC that we were riding in
was an organic IDARF vehicle.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:84%
That vehicle didn't belong
to the civilization.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
That was one of ours.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's not to say they
did have advanced vehicles

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and transportation that
they were using as well.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why do the
Draco want this planet

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to go out into space?

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They wanted them to
become as technologically

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
advanced as possible
as quickly as possible

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
because the ultimate goal of
merging being with technology

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.325 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately where they
were heading towards.

00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are they still
heading that way?

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.617 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Still heading
in that direction.

00:09:50.617 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we keep coming
back to this same cultural

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:90%
psychological problem.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:84%
We know that when advanced
societies come into a lower

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
tech society, it has a dramatic
effect on the psychology

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and the culture of
the low-tech society.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Draco don't care
if it's devastating to them.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But did you witness the effects
of this sudden shift or culture

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:90%
on these poor people?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I venture to say that
some of the effects that we

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
were witnessing was expressed
in the form of the rebellion,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
those that were fighting
the moving forward

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and the technological
advancements, the abandonment

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of their old social
system, their abandonment

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
of their old way of life in
which they didn't have a fiat

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:90%
currency system.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
centralized government

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
telling them what and
where they could live,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:90%
what they had to do it each day.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.855 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I did witness some of
that rebellion, some of the--

00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there
suicide attempts

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:90%
go up, murder rates go up?

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
expression of tension

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:84%
was there in the society
while this was going on?

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I can tell you upon
my return, they had bars,

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:90%
they had more alcohol.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
They had more fights.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
They had a need for police
and security forces.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They had a need for security
systems and security personnel

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
because there were
increases in murders.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:84%
There were increases in violent
activities against each other.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a society that
was having to adjust

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and reeling from
just getting out

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:84%
of a global war, in which
a significant portion

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:90%
of the population had perished.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And now they're being brought
in from all remote corners

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
of the planet to larger cities
and being told where to live

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and this is the house
that you're going to have

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.885 align:middle line:84%
and this is what you're
going to be doing.

00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And it, at first, went from
a shellshocked population

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:84%
to I'm just glad that
the fighting stopped.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And then once they had
accustomed themselves

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to a certain amount
of peaceful existence,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
especially compared with
what had been occurring,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
it allowed that recoil to
happen and for the people

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
self-evaluation of what's

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
This is not the same world
that we used to have.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And a significant
portion of the population

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
were accepting enough because
they had survived the war

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that they were
willing to relinquish

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous amount of
their own personal freedoms

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:90%
in exchange for that safety.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But there were portions of
the populations that didn't.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:90%
They didn't accept that.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This is very close to
a UN project called Agenda 21

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to
implement before the end

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:90%
of the 21st century.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
To essentially,
the planned states

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that they want to take people
out of the country and move

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
everybody into
large urban centers.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Is this part of this
larger plan, do you think?

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well having seen it in
action in person on Callidus 3,

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
because Earth has

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
gone through a different
preparation stage

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to try and bring
about those end goals,

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
the Agenda 21 goals
are to also reduce

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:84%
the population of the planet
by a significant portion

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.030 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:90%
What happens to those people?

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.568 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well even better,
are they going to use a war?

00:13:48.568 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Is that how they do this?

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Right.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
It's that inch by inch
movement towards a goal, where

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
the whole theory behind
putting a frog in boiling water

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.027 align:middle line:84%
or putting a frog in
water and then boiling it.

00:14:02.027 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
He's going to jump out
of the boiling water.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But if it happens that he's in
there while it's starting off

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
cold, he's not going to
notice the difference.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And the application of that
concept towards the population

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
of, OK, we'll make it so bad
that you will accept just

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:84%
about anything else
that's different,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that was part of the
psychological process

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:90%
that they'd used on Callidus 3.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.163 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Any other memories?

00:14:29.163 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: One of the other
memories that I'd had

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
was of working on the orbital
platform for Callidus 3.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And part of my job
and my responsibility

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
was to help with the
utility distribution

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
within the conditioned
spaces on the space station.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And part of the problem was
that they had not accounted--

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
because of the
speed and necessity

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
in which they built it, there
was an error in the design.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
They had overlooked the need
for additional conditioning--

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:84%
water, air, the services for
certain parts of the station.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And so part of
the problem was we

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
had to figure out a
way to now include

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:26.390 align:middle line:84%
this in a structure that
was already finished built.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.192 align:middle line:84%
The station hadn't
been completed yet,

00:15:29.192 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but we had to figure out a
way in which we were going

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to add on the air
conditioning, if you will,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
for certain parts
of the station.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And the way the
station is built is

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that it was a series
of elongated spheres

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:90%
that were connected at the ends.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And the aspect
ratio was very long,

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
so it made it look like a
lobbed cylinder in the length.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And then all along the
entire length of the station

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
were landing pads for
shuttles to mate to.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And so what we ended up
doing was we ended up,

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
instead of having some of
the equipment inside, which

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is where it was
supposed to be, we

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
ended up dedicating and taking
over some of those landing pads

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
for locating the
equipment and then

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
creating the enclosures for
them so that we could distribute

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and put the air conditioning,
the air, the gases, all

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
the different services
that they needed.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You were only
gone, what, a year

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:90%
and a half when you came back?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: About.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How did they develop all
the engineers and technocrats

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.093 align:middle line:90%
with no background?

00:16:46.093 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:90%
How would you do that?

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It would seem to be
almost impossible.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the space station
experience was at the very end,

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
so that was even a couple of
years later after coming back.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:90%
But you're absolutely right.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
They have to develop an
infrastructure for training

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:90%
the people to begin with.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they have people that
learn and through experience.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
Well what they did
was they utilized

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
some of the advanced
technology training systems

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that we had learned
from in order

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to train the civilian
population to be

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:84%
able to do any of
the advanced jobs

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
or work categories that were
required for the space work.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
For the construction
on the planet,

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
it was a little different.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It still required some
of the advanced training

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
that they needed because
they went from a largely

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
agricultural society to now
an advanced technologically

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:90%
advanced society.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they built antimatter
engines for their shuttles.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Did they use resources found
on that planet to do that?

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So now we're mining.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they've created
a whole mining system?

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.613 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Then they're going
to need a transportation

00:17:59.613 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:84%
system to get the stuff to
wherever it needs to go.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we're talking
about a lot of work.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A lot of work.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it was automated.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't necessary to have
a person-operated mining

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:84%
operation or a mining cart or
a person-operated mining drill.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
The technology that
was shared with them

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
was jumpstarted because
while I was gone,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
they provided them with
the basics and necessities

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
for getting it started, for
giving them a leg up on getting

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:84%
it going, and the training
programs that had occurred.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a number of stages
that they had to go through.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
They had to build the
manufacturing facilities,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and some of those came in
as ready-built facilities.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So the IDARF provided them
with a ready-made manufacturing

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
facility that was just put
together by IDARF forces,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and then the local people were
trained on how to operate it.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, then
they could create and expand

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:84%
on their own
manufacturing abilities.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So did they switch
to centralized food

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%
production at the same time?

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So now mass farms
were all over the place?

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: There were mass farms.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
They also utilized replication
technologies for their foods.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
They had a phase-out of
farming because that land would

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:84%
eventually be changed
over for other uses.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have to
devote a whole large area

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:90%
to agricultural purposes.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But they would
still need to mine

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that would
go into the replicator

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.207 align:middle line:90%
to replicate the food?

00:19:52.207 --> 00:19:53.007 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Correct.

00:19:53.007 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it's
still a lot of work.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Still a lot of work.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And you got to
keep in mind, too,

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that the entire planetary
population that was left,

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:84%
which was around 2 billion,
was all dedicated and devoted

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:90%
There were no other professions.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Every person, abled body,
was dedicated and devoted

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
towards the rebuilding efforts
and towards the modernization

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:90%
efforts.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't a matter of
having 10% of the population

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:90%
doing it.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.627 align:middle line:90%
It was everybody.

00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was involved, which
is another reason why there were

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people unhappy
with being forced into doing

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:84%
a manufacturing job when
their entire life has

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:90%
been spent on a farm.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you're
saying that these top 13

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
families were giving out
the orders to the 2 billion?

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they were getting
their orders from the Draco?

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.878 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
They're already
on the war footing

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
by the time of the end
of the war comes around

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and the need for moving
into the next phase, which

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:90%
is the rebuilding efforts.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got
an entire population

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that has already
been participating,

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
experiencing advanced
technology, the--

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Higher organization.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Higher
organizational structures.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
They had already seen
the fact that there

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
was an invading army from outer
space not from that planet.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Had in so many levels
and ways helped

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:84%
them to change their
mind and mindsets

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
from a largely agrarian
society to a society that

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
is technology dependent
or technology assisted.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And so to make the
transition, most

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
of the psychological
aspects had already

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:84%
been addressed from the
war because they'd already

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
seen advanced technologies
destroy their planet.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.285 align:middle line:84%
They had already encountered it
helping to defend their planet.

00:21:54.285 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
They had already seen examples
of it for the prior years

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:84%
before the transition
to rebuilding.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we know
from psychology

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that fear is an
incredible motivator.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's an
unbelievable motivator.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yep.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So they created an aura of fear
with these beasts coming in.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Then you guys came in
and defeated the beasts

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and slowly converted the
population through the process

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:90%
into a new psychology.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was also the
underlying fear that,

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:84%
what if there's another
invading force out there?

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't want this
to happen again.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So how do we best
protect ourselves?

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, we embrace
technology and move

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:84%
as fast forward as we can
so that we'll no longer have

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
to be faced with the
same kind of war that

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:90%
destroyed our planet before.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Now these are some
of the changes

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that they would have
employed over and over again

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.350 align:middle line:84%
because of its
success, and it worked.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
The psychology involved
with using fear

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to motivate an entire population
to embrace new technologies

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.455 align:middle line:84%
and moving forward
technologically,

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:90%
it would have worked.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So they would have been
using this over and over

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:84%
again on one planet
after another

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:90%
because it was successful.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And fear is an
incredible motivator

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to get people to move forward,
to embrace technology,

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.660 align:middle line:84%
to do things differently, and to
accept things that they may not

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:90%
have accepted before.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Because now in their
own eyes, they're

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
seeing themselves as
being better protected,

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
better guarded against for
a future invading army.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:84%
They now have the
technological abilities

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to defend themselves
because they have advances.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The Draco secretly
control this planet,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and they're letting the planet
defend itself against invaders.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So isn't now the planet
ready to defend itself

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:90%
against the Draco?

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There is a certain
irony in there, isn't there?

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Draco's
plan, keep in mind,

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is the bonding and
melding of being

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
with technology, what Earth
refers to as transhumanism.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And once they are
able to replace

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:84%
a large portion of the
biological processes

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
with technology, that
is their ultimate goal

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
because then they
can individually

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
control in the fullest extent
every single being that's

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.410 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't
matter if they think

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
they have the ability to
defend themselves and stand up

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:90%
to the Draco.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:84%
If they remain on that path
of becoming mostly machine

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and partly live
being, then they are

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:84%
handing over their free
will and relinquishing it

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:90%
to being controlled.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter whether or not

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:84%
they've got all the tanks or ion
cannons or defensive structures

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:84%
because each and every person
within have that control

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.470 align:middle line:84%
mechanism in place where they
don't have the free will.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if you have 13
families running a society,

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.870 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get a stratified
society, a class system,

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really have a
class system before the war.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Correct.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But now they're
going to have one.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How do the
population react to the idea

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that they are now entering
into a class system

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and some people are going to
be more elite than others,

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.595 align:middle line:84%
have more riches, have
more freedoms than others?

00:25:39.595 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
There must have been
some resentment.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The resentment was
expressed through the very

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:90%
short-lived rebellion.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the
population were either

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
too shellshocked to
realize it, or they

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:84%
had consented because they
were no longer in fear of being

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:90%
killed by an invading army.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And so by relinquishing those
rights in exchange for safety,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.748 align:middle line:90%
they had accepted that.

00:26:10.748 --> 00:26:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They had
accepted that they're

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.253 align:middle line:84%
going to be ruled
by these 13 families

00:26:14.253 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't even
know about before.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Correct.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well that's
quite a trick.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Keep them busy, keep
them distracted, and keep them

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:90%
occupied elsewhere.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And then before you
know it, there's

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:84%
an entire system in place
that's controlling them

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that had been
around for decades.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do they have
media on this planet?

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, they did not.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No media.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
No newspapers, no radios,
no television, no magazines,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:90%
no books?

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nope.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Just educational material
that was needed for training.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Because again, you got to think
during this transition period,

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
people were working for extended
periods of time contributing.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And there was an amazing amount
of co-creative contribution

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:84%
to rebuilding the
planet, and everybody

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:90%
was interested in helping.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And so hiding it behind
let's rebuild our planet,

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
people weren't focused on
what are the politics going on

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes that we're
relinquishing our control,

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and there is now
a divided society

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:90%
which we have two classes.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:84%
People weren't
thinking about that.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.860 align:middle line:84%
They were occupied with
the rebuilding efforts.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Usually after a really
big war where a lot of people

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
are lost, there
is a big huge boom

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
of children following that,
as it was after World War II.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Was there a population
boom after this?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a
great question, Jay.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was no
exception to that.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it was encouraged
because the population had been

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:84%
so decimated that
there were within each

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:84%
of the small communities--
because they didn't have

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
mainstream media
or media outlets,

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
the way that they were able
to disseminate information

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
were like neighborhood
groups in which

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
there were families
that were neighbors,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and that neighborhood
group had information

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and they disseminated
amongst their neighbors.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: This was after the war?

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: After the war.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you didn't even
have media after the war?

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nope.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well how are you
getting mass orders and people

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.092 align:middle line:90%
telling people what to do?

00:28:30.092 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's where the
neighborhood groups come in.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.592 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That would take forever.

00:28:33.592 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well you've
got to figure,

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
they also had the benefits
of communication technology.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
communicate in real time,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and so they were able
to transfer information

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.280 align:middle line:84%
in the form of, OK,
here's the production

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.898 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have, and
it was written out and something

00:28:57.898 --> 00:28:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that they were able
to take with them

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.285 align:middle line:84%
and share with their
neighborhood groups.

00:29:01.285 --> 00:29:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You would
need blueprints.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:90%
You would need all sorts of--

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: All digitized.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they had digital--
did they have pads, anything?

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had small
handheld computer systems

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to share,
and every single family

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:90%
had one.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.148 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well that's
kind of a media.

00:29:18.148 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep, true.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.080 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But I guess I was thinking
along the lines of--

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Television.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --Television or
newspaper or a magazine print

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:90%
media.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.752 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did they have internet?

00:29:28.752 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They did have
a form of internet,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and it was specifically
and very strictly

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
regulated just for the
rebuilding purposes.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you needed information
on a particular element

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
because you were going to be
mixing two metals together

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and you needed to know
the right combinations,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:90%
that information was there.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And how much help did
you, IDARF, give these people

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the war?

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I wasn't there for
the initial stages when

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.490 align:middle line:90%
they had set all this up.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I found out about how they
set it up after the fact

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and had seen some
of the legacy issues

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:90%
that were still being used.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So I found out about
that after the fact.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did corporations
here on Earth

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
exploit poor countries and poor
people for their resources?

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Did that happen on this planet?

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Did American corporations
or Earth-based corporations

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.123 align:middle line:84%
move into this planet
and start operating?

00:30:29.123 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, they did.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They did?

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And there were a number
of the mining operations

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that were operated by Earth
corporations, four Earth

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.280 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And the way they
got away with that

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:84%
was that they were
able to donate

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:48.712 align:middle line:84%
a certain portion of the mining
materials and the raw materials

00:30:48.712 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that they produced towards
the planetary regrowth,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:90%
towards the regrouping.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did these
corporations sell the things

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that they produced to
the people of the planet?

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:90%
They sold them elsewhere.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:84%
They donated a portion of
their mining or their resource

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
production or whatever it
was that they were doing--

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't just
for mining of minerals--

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:84%
they donated a certain
portion of that as a payment.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine that a
large percentage of that

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.510 align:middle line:90%
went to the 13 families.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of it was
taken off planet for sale

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Would it be fair
to say that the whole idea

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of corporate culture could be
a result of Draco interference?

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well based on the
information that I had

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and the complete infiltration
by the Mars Germans into every

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
major corporation on the planet
from one end of the spectrum

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to the other-- aerospace to
agriculture to petrochem to gas

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.520 align:middle line:90%
to oil--

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.410 align:middle line:84%
they were already infiltrated
by the Mars Germans.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Now the Mars Germans,
as we've discussed,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:84%
are, in a certain respect,
proxies of the Draco.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the Draco controlling
those proxies so that they

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:90%
can further their efforts.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say that those
mining and the resources that

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.680 align:middle line:84%
were taken weren't
used by the Draco

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to help create some of
the other hybrids that

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:90%
were used elsewhere?

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say that
they weren't using

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:84%
those materials for
producing or building

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:90%
new ships or new facilities?

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Or spiders.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.125 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Or spiders, exactly.

00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we really wouldn't
know, because the corporation

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.640 align:middle line:84%
is an entity unto itself,
what they're really doing.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Especially if they're
off the planet

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and out of the way of any
laws, rules, and regulations.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And since the 13 families
are running the place, that's

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:90%
going to be a norm.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.663 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's going
to be their norm.
