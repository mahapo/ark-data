>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:10%
we are with Tim who is
speaking with us from Germany.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a Tactical Advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:10%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you so much
for having me again.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, who are
the ground people?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And what can you
tell us about them?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well,
interestingly enough,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
most people assume that humans
are the only intelligent

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:90%
species on this planet Earth.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And a growing number
of people are actually

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging the fact that the
universe is full of other life

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
forms, but most people
do not have a clue

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
that humans are not the
only species inhabiting

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:90%
planet Earth.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
There's another species living
deep down in the ground,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:90%
below the surface of Earth.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves
the ground people.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do we
know of their origins?

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, they are pretty
passive about their existence

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and they do not interfere
with humanity as much as other

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
animals on this planet or other
life forms on this planet.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
But there were times, if we're
talking about 10,000 years ago,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
where the ground people were
actually more communicative

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and in conversation with
humans, surface level

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.325 align:middle line:90%
humans at that time.

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason why we find

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
ancient descriptions of very
powerful insectoid beings,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
ant-like beings actually
all over the place.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did these ant
beings pre-exist humans

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:90%
or are they more recent?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah, 100%.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So this planet actually is
much more of an ant planet

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:90%
than of a human planet.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:90%
So humans actually are here--

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
well, the Homo Sapien is said
to be here for 70,000 years,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
but those ant
beings are actually

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
they preceded the dinosaurs.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If they
preceded the dinosaurs,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
are they considered a
highly advanced species?

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
How do they compare to the
intelligence of humans?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, they
are super intelligent,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
very smart beings that evolved
hundreds of thousands of years

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:90%
into a highly evolved species.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
They're walking upright
but that's more or less

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:84%
the only similarity that the
ground people have with humans.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
They're very exotic
in their thinking

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and very exotic in their
social cultural system,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
very far away from what
humans would consider

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:90%
a civilization in that way.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
technologically advanced

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:90%
compared to humans?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yes, they are using
a certain type of technology

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but compared to humans,
it's very little.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So they inhabit huge
cities in the cave-like,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
what we would call the
honeycomb structure of Earth.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Which is also being portrayed
in mainstream more and more

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:90%
lately.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So mainstream
basically acknowledged

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:84%
that there are huge cavern-like
structures below the surface,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
while still not acknowledging
that they're inhabited but they

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:90%
are actually inhabited.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And those ant-like
beings, mostly they

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
are structured about-- around
their own abilities, what

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
they can do with their bodies
and their work ethics that

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
is very high.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But they also have a
very strong spiritual

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:90%
or energetical psionic ability.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they ever come
up to the surface of Earth

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:90%
or do they stay underground?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Very rare, actually.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So there are here,
and there are cases--

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I've actually talked to
someone who's dear to me.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
She hasn't anything to
do with ET presences

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
but she actually met a giant
ant in Indonesia lately,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and hearing this voice, the
ground people, in her head.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, there are
reported cases of sightings,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:84%
but it's very, very,
very rare to see them.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But lately since this
shift that's going on

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:84%
is accelerating, they
are more and more

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:90%
preparing for certain scenarios.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:90%
And they are also--

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
they have been active
around 15,000 years ago

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
when the last shift happened and
this flood occurred on Earth.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty
active around then

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
because they are also
inhabiting this planet

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and they are prepared
for what's happening.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
They've been through that, they
know what's going to happen,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and they are benevolently
helping out humans.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're prepared to,
in any case, whatever might

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.565 align:middle line:90%
happen, to assist humanity.

00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There are
cultures on Earth,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
like the Hopi, who describe a
species, possibly the ground

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Do they have an
influence on Earth today?

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, it's
true that the Hopi--

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
not only Hopi but the Hopi
do it very explicitly.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
They describe this ant
species to have helped them

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:90%
in times of the flood.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:10%
They actually appeared
on the surface

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:10%
and they took a lot of
the humans underground.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
the reason why we still

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
have human civilizations
underground

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:84%
within the so-called
Agarthan network.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
But the communication with the
ground people and governments

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:90%
is very, very rare.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
almost no communication

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
because they are so
exotic in the way

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
that they perceive
life and the way

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
that they build their
society around it, which

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
makes it super difficult for
humans to even understand

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:90%
what they're about.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that is known is

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that humans used to be much
more of a traveling species back

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:90%
in the days.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And the invention
of agriculture,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
actually, was introduced to
humans by the ground people.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So the ground people itself
has, well, very evolved,

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and like species, they actually
have the technique in order

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to agriculturally
harvest certain plants

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:90%
and grow food from that.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And humans at that
time did not have that

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
so this was one of the exchanges
that took place in history.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If the ground people
are aware of agriculture

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and know they need light
to grow organic life,

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:90%
how do they exist underground?

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: As far as I've read
documentation is that they are

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
aware and technologically
advanced enough to know

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
the effects of ultraviolet
light and other light sources.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And they have actually used
artificial lights in order

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to grow certain plants
and agricultural products.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So they are indeed
using technology,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
but it's kind of integrated
into their whole lifestyle

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's not at all
as much as humans,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
even mainstream human humans
are using technology right now.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If they have tech,
do they also have factories

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:90%
and other manufacturing plants?

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.025 align:middle line:84%
What else do we know about
their underground life, Tim?

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So the interesting
thing is that they do not have

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:90%
factories.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So that is one of the reasons
why the ground people are not

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
of interest for the
human governments

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:84%
at all, because their
way of producing things

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:84%
is much more around their
work ethics, their structures.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So what they have is
they dig huge tunnels

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and use those caverns in
order to build cities.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And they using natural
material for that in order

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
to grow more or less houses in
a very exotic way that is not of

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
use for any kind of human
infrastructure in that way.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
similar to ants in terms

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:90%
of creating structures?

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah, very much so.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So basically the planet
itself is dominated by ants,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's not at all
the human species

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that is the most predominant
species on this planet at all.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, the ants that we
find on the surface level

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:84%
are actually very far related
to the evolved species

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:90%
that we found underground.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:84%
What we also see is that
there are certain cities--

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's in South
America or in the Middle East,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I guess--

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:90%
if I recollect correctly--

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
where you have
certain structures

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the Earth
where archaeologists claim

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that they are human made
but they are actually

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:90%
surface hives and buildings.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
The remainings of what
the ground people actually

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:84%
left on the surface
before they completely

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:84%
vanished from the surface
and went underground.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: During the
last Earth shift,

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
some myths and cultures suggest
that the ground people helped

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:90%
humankind survive.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Was a new culture
created in association

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:90%
with the ground people?

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Oh, it's a
fascinating story.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for asking that.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So basically the
last Earth shift

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
happened 12,500 to
15,000 years ago.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can see in
the iron particles

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:90%
that a pole shift happened.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So that caused the
flood actually.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
There used to be some kind of
knowledge about those beings

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So ancient civilizations
were much more open

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:84%
about their knowledge of other
highly intelligent beings,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
ant-like beings living
together with them.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Somehow humanity has forgotten
that these beings are there

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and there seem to be no
mutual interest between them.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But there are still mysteries
and stories about them,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
talking about ants
that could actually

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:90%
alter the fabric of reality.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they can
do because they are very

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:90%
much evolved around psionics.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was that when
the flood actually occurred,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
those ants are
very, very sensitive

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:90%
in terms of natural phenomena.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
They know what's happening, they
are here for millions of years,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and they are prepared
for the Earth's shift

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:90%
and they're benevolent.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is
they took several types

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
of human civilizations into
those underground caves,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and they are producing this
kind of ant bread, I would say.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's a specific
form of food where

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
they are growing from
plants and then composing it

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:90%
with their saliva, very yummy.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But that was actually
what they feed it

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:90%
to the humans at that time.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And very much indeed,
so the question

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
is leading into
the right direction

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
because most of those
human civilizations

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
did not come to
the surface again.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.860 align:middle line:84%
They remained underground,
and that's actually

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
the reason why we do have those
underground civilizations that

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
have been found in the, I
guess, 1960s where humans were

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
actually building underground
bases around Mexico

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and in the Nevada Desert,
and were actually hitting

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:90%
into those cavern systems.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When the
humans were saved

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
by the ground people, how many
years were they underground?

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And why did some
people choose to leave

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:90%
and others choose to stay?

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.945 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about that?

00:12:47.945 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah, we know that.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So actually the
natural phenomena

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in
the last Earth shift

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
was that the poles actually--

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
well, they did not switch
but they aligned differently.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And that basically
caused the magnetic field

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth to turn
in some way, which,

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
of course, caused those giant
waves coming from the ocean.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So basically we're
dealing with a situation

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
where those civilizations
back then had multiple ways

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:90%
to deal with what's going on.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
15,000 years ago there
was an open exchange

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
between those civilizations and
different other civilizations

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:90%
across the cosmos.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So basically all these super
significant and intricate

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
buildings that we have,
for example, the pyramids

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
or different other temples that
could not be replicated today,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
they were all influenced
by this relationship

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that they have and had with
different other civilizations.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So basically the
majority of people

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
were actually rescued in a way
that some of the species that

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
are already and still,
and for this moment

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
are also prepared to step
in, they were using huge,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
gigantic crafts in order to
lift people away from that.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is option number one
that some of those people

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:90%
lived through.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Option two was because
of the solar flash that

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
occurred in that,
transmuted and transformed

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
the human consciousness,
some of those people

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
were just elevated into another
realm of higher consciousness.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
human civilizations

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:84%
back then are actually known
to still exist but outside

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
of this realm in other places.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
know that there used

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to be a civilization
a little West

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:90%
from England, today's England.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And their civilization
completed-- the island

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:90%
completely went underground.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not even there yet.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Still we have maps, ancient maps
that are telling us about them.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And we still have
or in the project

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
we've received
messages from them

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that they were warning
humanity that another Earth

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:90%
shift is coming.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:90%
So they still exist.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And the third option is actually
what we're talking about,

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
the more or less the
leftovers of humanity

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that they were integrated
into underground caverns.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
the reason why

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:84%
we have around 80 million
houses in South America,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:84%
but we've actually
over time have only

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:90%
found like below 10 bodies.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So we've not-- we
have no idea where

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:84%
all those people of
mainstream archaeology

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
had no idea where all
those people vanished,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.045 align:middle line:84%
why they went vanished,
where they went to.

00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where did the ground
people have their civilizations

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: They have caverns
and huge cities, for example,

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:84%
in South America, in the
desert areas of the US

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and in the Asias but because
they're ants they are building

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
all these kinds of tunnels
so they can actually appear

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:90%
everywhere on Earth.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So what we-- the
reports that we get

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
are especially Asia
and, well, the area

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:90%
around Nevada and Colorado too.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there are
reports and actually cities

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:90%
around Nevada and Colorado.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can we find
these cities and caverns

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.805 align:middle line:84%
through the ground penetrating
radar technologies?

00:16:57.805 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah, 100%.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:90%
So I think that--

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:84%
so it's not my expertise
but as much as I know,

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
the conventional technology
is not able to go that deep,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:90%
but I think that--

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
so basically the
advanced technology

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
can detect them because
it goes so deeply.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I think I remember the amount
that the US technology can--

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
how deep it can go, but I'm not
quite sure because it's miles

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not 100% sure.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, they could
detect those cities.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And also there's an
existing map that

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
has been given to the
governments around the--

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- 1990s, I think,
where all the bigger locations

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
are marked so that upcoming
projects would not terribly

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
destroy certain buildings and
cities that are on the ground.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So where are the ground
people's exits and entrances

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.745 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, Tim?

00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Beautiful question.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So the entrances and exits
are pretty much everywhere.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So basically the whole Earth
has tunnels all over the place.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So there are ant tunnels,
digging everywhere on Earth.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And every major area on the
planet, on the surface planet

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:90%
has those entrances and exits.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But what we know
is that there has

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:84%
been an initiative
from the human side

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:90%
to mostly hide those entrances.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's some technology in
use, which is highly advanced,

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and is using magnetic fields
that would actually make you--

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
well, you wouldn't even see the
entrance in that perspective.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And you would probably
be repelled from it.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that
they have placed onto--

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to hide those entrances
so people would not by accident

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:90%
walk into there.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With all
the underground bomb

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
testing our
militaries have done,

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
how has that affected
the ground people?

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Oh, yeah, very much so.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Basically surface
governments did not

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:84%
know about their existence
until quite recently,

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:90%
like 30 years ago or something.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And those underground bombings
and pretty much digging tunnels

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and building
underground bases, it

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
was pretty much destructive
to their society

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:90%
and their buildings.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So the communication between
those humans in the Agarthan

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:84%
networks underground
is pretty much better

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:84%
than the communication between
surface governments and ground

00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So that is actually
the moment when

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
people came together and marked
all the different locations

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
where there should not be
any underground activities.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Or if there's
underground activities,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:23.025 align:middle line:84%
on a fairly low
height in that way.

00:20:23.025 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are we aware of any
conflicts between ground people

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:90%
and governments worldwide?

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I would assume
that, here and there,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
there might be some aggression
from human side but I

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:90%
don't know.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I know that the ground people
communicated their concerns

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
about the aggression
on human side,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:84%
but then again they're super
benevolent in that way, not

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:90%
oriented towards war at all.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, again,
they're super advanced.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Especially what their
defensive mechanisms

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and their psionic
abilities, which

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is enormous because through
the way their antennas

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:84%
are structured,
they are pretty much

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
able to manipulate
and be sensitive

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.985 align:middle line:90%
around electromagnetic fields.

00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do the ground
people communicate with humans

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:90%
when they have concerns?

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Basically they
can appear telepathically.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are a
lot of people that have

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
telepathic contact to those--

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:90%
the ground people.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that
they are more in contact

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
with those Agarthan
network civilizations,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and they are indeed in contact
with the surface governments

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.053 align:middle line:84%
so there's this kind
of maneuver going on.

00:21:51.053 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a relationship
between the ground people

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.316 align:middle line:90%
and ETs who engage with humans?

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Very little actually.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:90%
So they're pretty much isolated.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
We know that they appear in
different other realities

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and dimensions as
well because they

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.240 align:middle line:84%
have this very profound
spiritual side to them.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:84%
That they can use portal
technology and very advanced

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
other technologies, but
we don't see an exchange

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
or a trading program
between humans or other ETs,

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
reptiles, or something
like that, and those--

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:90%
the ground people.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Because their social
structure and the way

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:84%
they form their
reality is super exotic

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:90%
compared to other species.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you're
saying the ground

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.945 align:middle line:84%
people have a stargate
technology to go off planet?

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It's less technology
and more that they are

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
incorporating their own
psionic effects because--

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
so the interesting thing
is that humans are always--

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:84%
when they think about
reality modifications,

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that they instantly
think about technology.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, your own
spiritual understanding

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
of reality and the way you can
bend reality through psionics

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
is actually just as much
valuable as technology.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a
different approach.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And they are actually
using much more

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
of their own spiritual
abilities in order

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:31.020 align:middle line:84%
to move quite smoothly
between different realities.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's a lot of
discussion about insectoid ETs.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection
to the ground people?

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: It depends.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is that ant
species are-- the ground

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
people in general are
much more isolated.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.550 align:middle line:84%
There are hives and big
networks of kingdoms and--

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
so they basically have
either a queen or a king

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
building their
hives around that.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And they are on other
planets as well so there's

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:90%
communication between them.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking
about insectoids,

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:84%
we're often talking
about the mantis beings

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and different species
that come into mind when

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:84%
we think about that, and there
seem to be very little contact.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be very much
isolated in that way.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If the ground people
are prepared for the next Earth

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:84%
shift that we are
currently facing,

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.835 align:middle line:84%
how will they interact
with humankind this time?

00:24:26.835 --> 00:24:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Oh, we know that they
are prepared to help again.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So they have done
their homework in that,

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:90%
if you want to put it that way.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:84%
They are prepared for
what's going to happen,

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
they are prepared for the
upcoming physical and natural

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.570 align:middle line:84%
phenomena on this planet, very
much so because there's so much

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:90%
integrated into their society.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But they are also able
and do have plans,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
communicated plans that
they are willing to help.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen an
increase in sightings

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:84%
in the last three to five
years on the surface level,

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
but we've also seen that
they communicated much more

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.875 align:middle line:90%
about their existence to many--

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:90%
in many contexts scenarios.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And offering through that
their help and the assurance

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that whatever could
happen that they are here,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:84%
that they have a place for
people to basically take them

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:90%
as refugees and to help out.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Will this help
be more for civilians

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
or governmental and
leadership types?

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: No, they are not at all
oriented towards governmental

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So basically what they're doing
is they value the individual

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:90%
much higher than that.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It's almost cute in
the way that they

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:90%
perceive humans in that way.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So they think of us
more like the way

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that we would help a helpless
animal, that we would

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:90%
love to assist in that way.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
meant for people

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
that are able to resist
the challenges that

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:84%
come with meeting
a two meter ant,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:84%
but they would do that for the
benefit of the unorganized.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the takeaway
from the ground people

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.745 align:middle line:90%
that we can benefit from, Tim?

00:26:35.745 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Maybe two thoughts.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The first thought is
become aware of the reality

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that there is another highly
intelligent and benevolent

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:90%
species on this planet.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So in ET beings do not
need to be ET in that way.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And the other thought
is that whatever

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
happens and could
occur, the ground people

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:90%
are there and are here.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:06.470 align:middle line:90%
And they are benevolent.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.356 align:middle line:90%
And even if the--

00:27:09.356 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
an ant does not usually fit
and suit the typical aesthetics

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:84%
that humans have,
they are benevolent

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and, yeah, they
are here to help.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, Tim, how can
we be proactive and contact

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:84%
these beings to secure
ourselves as individuals

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and our own individual safety?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So take into
consideration that ants,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
because they have those
antennas and those capabilities,

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:46.130 align:middle line:84%
they are very sensitive
around the frequency that you

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:84%
irradiate, the attributes
and the inner understanding

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and the way you react to them.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So if they sense that you
get along with this reality

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that there could be a two meter
tall ant that stands in front

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:90%
of you, they will sense that.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you could prepare yourself
for that, that would be great.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And other than that
I would say, well, I

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:90%
would love to meet them.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think the approach
that I would choose

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:90%
is going into meditation.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:90%
But other than that, let's see.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:23.865 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:23.865 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many humans
can fit underground

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and be accommodated?

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I think around
three million was the number

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:84%
of humans that they could
effectively take underground,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.410 align:middle line:84%
but don't forget that there are
other species that have major

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:84%
plans for whatever
could happen to step in.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So basically we know
that those from Orion,

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.090 align:middle line:84%
they have communicated
that their ships have

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
this white outer glow.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And that people should be
prepared that if ever they

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:84%
see a craft that has
a white outer glow,

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:90%
then it's trustworthy.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, Tim, is this Earth
shift thing going to be gradual

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:90%
or is it going to be drastic?

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I'm quoting, "It's
always gradual, gradual,

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.400 align:middle line:90%
gradual until it's not."

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So basically that's
what I've been told.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So basically what we see
is a gradual preparation

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that will take place
over the next few years

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
until we hit a sweet spot with--

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:90%
just happening.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.692 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:29:31.692 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you so much,
again, for having me.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:10%
