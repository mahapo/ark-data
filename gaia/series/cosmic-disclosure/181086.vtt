[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:19.362 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hey
everybody, Jay Weidner here.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:10%
We are back today
with Jason Rice,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:10%
who purports to be in
the Secret Space Program.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Thank you, Jay.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:10%
Appreciate you having me here.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Yeah, it's been great.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:90%
So let's get back to--

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
you were just finishing up
your duty on Planet Two.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was the same
kind of false flag scenario

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Cabal, using
conflict and post-conflict

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:90%
to have things go their way.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And you served almost six
years in this dire situation.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Eventually your side
overcame the enemy

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:84%
through the use of
high tech weapons,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and now you're done
with that planet.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: What happens
next is the aftermath,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:84%
there are units that
remain on the planet

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to help with clean up,
reseeding, restarting

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.725 align:middle line:84%
their civilization in the
ways that those in charge,

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:84%
the Cabal, want to have it done,
that best suits their needs.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And when we say
the Cabal, we also

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:10%
mean they are puppets as
well of the Draco and the AI.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So setting the planet
up takes more time.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And our work there,
being done, they

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:90%
redeploy us to another planet--

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, no.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.304 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --to repeat the
process, Planet Three.

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did it have
any other name?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.915 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not that I recall, yeah.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so what was the
situation on this planet?

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This planet was
unique from the other two.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And Planet Three just
so happens to have

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
had three distinct races on
the surface of that planet.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.424 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Indigenous?

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Indigenous
from the standpoint

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
of, as far as we knew,
they had originated there.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The chances are, of
three separate species

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
as widely different as
they are having originated

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
on the same planet, I have
suspicions that they did not,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and that there was at least
one or two of them that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
originated elsewhere
and were either

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.726 align:middle line:84%
seeded or brought or
transferred there.

00:02:29.726 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Can you describe
these three races?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
The first race would
be human-like, very

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
similar to any human you'd see
out and about on Earth today.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
The second race was an
insectoid-like race.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They were about 3
and 1/2, 4 feet tall.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:90%
They have an oval-shaped head.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
They have silvery,
round-shaped eyes.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
They have very small
mouths, very small noses,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:90%
almost no to zero ears.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
They're telepathic, and they
communicate telepathically.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Their teeth are very
sharp pointed teeth.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:90%
They have reverse jointed legs.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.835 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They stand
up on two legs?

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They stand
up on two legs.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
At some point in their
past, they crawled as well

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
because we saw evidence of
them crawling or walking

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
on walls and ceilings.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.555 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had
that ability still.

00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Because
they're an insect,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
they look more like than
another insect on Earth?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, nothing
like them at all

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:90%
in our cornucopia of insects.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Not praying mantis or--

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --ants?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were round faced.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:90%
They had shoulders, arms.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Their arms were longer
than the typical.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What was their skin like?

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was like a green,
light green, yellowish green,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:90%
semi-transparent.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: In that you could
see into it a little,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't like
looking through glass

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:90%
through their lens.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.175 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Translucent kind of.

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, kind
of translucent.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.409 align:middle line:84%
Then the third race
being a race of cyclops.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Cyclops?

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.346 align:middle line:90%
One-eyed humanoids?

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: One-eyed humanoids.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So do they have any
peculiar characteristics

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:90%
besides having one eye?

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That was it.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: These three
races did not get along?

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, they
did not, which meant

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
our job of trying to
unite them and get them

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
as a combined front was
that much more difficult.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So one more time,
there's an invader coming.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You've been sent in,
you and your guys.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And you made friends
with the indigs,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
only the indigs are now
three different populations.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.438 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Who were
the most difficult?

00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The insectoids.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Insectoids, why?

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't trust
any humanoid, period.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of
the first instances

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
where I was trying to arrange
a meeting with their equivalent

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:84%
of the mob, they had
criminal elements

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that we were trying to
get involved with as far

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:90%
as arranging coordination.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was to meet with one of
their mobs, the insectoids,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and was taken into a cave
area and was taken prisoner.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.083 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Why did they
take you prisoner?

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't trust
humans or humanoids.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.333 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were foolish
enough to go into their area,

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:90%
and so they arrested you.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.697 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So they were supposed
to meet me, but it was a trap.

00:05:41.697 --> 00:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
that I was there just

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to spy on them as part of
one of the other humanoids.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And how long
did you spend in jail?

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was three days a
POW before my comrades came

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and rescued me.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, at least
this group takes POWs.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The other two groups
that were before did not.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Did not.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And everything
turned out OK after that?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I spent
three days as a POW

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:90%
and was tortured and beaten.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You were?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And spent a couple
weeks after that recovering,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:84%
even though physically
I had healed

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.764 align:middle line:84%
within the day of the wounds
that they had given to me.

00:06:19.764 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It still took me a
couple weeks before I

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
was ready to get back
and go into the field.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And how was
it finally resolved?

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
able to get most

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:90%
of the populations onboard.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.550 align:middle line:84%
When I left Planet Three, it
was following a shuttle crash.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
The shuttle was brought
down by indigenous fire

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
because, again, they
didn't trust us.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was the insectoids that
had taken shots at the shuttle

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:90%
that I was on.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they brought
the shuttle down?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They brought
the shuttle down.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.983 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And you were in it?

00:06:51.983 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was in it, crashed,
suffered a tremendous amount

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
of physical damage,
and was medevaced

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:90%
to what they told me was Mars.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I have strong
suspicions that it was,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
where they replaced two of my
limbs and repaired the third,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and I spent the next
eight months learning

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
how to reuse my
limbs and reconnect

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
with the nanite
enhancement therapies.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And following all of that
therapy and treatment,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I was then reassigned to a new
unit back on Callidus Three

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
for part of the
cleanup operations,

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:90%
the retraining, the rebuilding.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you had been
in a battle or something,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
or were you just taking
the shuttle as a ride?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.245 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was catching
a ride from one part

00:07:41.245 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:90%
of the planet to the other.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
The enemy invaders
had not arrived yet.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd been on the
planet about 15 months

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and had run a number of missions
in which we were trying to,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
again, get buy in
and gain confidence.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
There were problems
with smuggling,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and they had a larger criminal
element on that planet.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
criminal elements

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
had taken to trying
to steal technology.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: From you guys?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, from some of the
other elements of the planet.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
There were humanoids and the
insectoids and the cyclops,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and so getting them involved
with defense preparations

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and building up
arms and stockpiles.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of it involved
very, very mild

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:90%
technological advancements.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, anything that was
above their standard base

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
was immediately a
black market item.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
noticing that some

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.826 align:middle line:84%
of the weapons that they were
building started disappearing.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we were
investigating that.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Who was the most
advanced of the three races,

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:90%
as far as technology?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
all pretty even--

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
even as far as where they
were at technologically.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.986 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the cyclops had high
technology for that world?

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they
were all three

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
about the same level, the
cyclops, the humanoids,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:90%
and the insectoids.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
There was no one that
was more than the other

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
because they'd been at war
off and on for a couple

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:90%
of centuries.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.956 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there were
skirmishes on the borders?

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Skirmishes
on the border.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They'd reached a
tentative peace agreement,

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:90%
and then it lasted for 20 years.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And so they had armaments.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you know what
the wars were about?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.421 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Race differences.

00:09:29.421 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you arrived
on this planet

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and there's practically
a mini civil war going

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:90%
on between three factions.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Correct.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.766 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Your job is
to unite these people

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and get ready for an
invasion of something.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
By now, you're not sure what's
coming because at first, you

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
thought they were going
to be the werewolves.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.387 align:middle line:84%
So now, you don't
know what's going on.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, we have no idea
what's going to be coming.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, a deliberate
intelligence blackout.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
If they knew, they
weren't telling us.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And these people
have weapons already?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you didn't have
to worry about that part.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had projectile
weapons, chemical weapons

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
from the standpoint of
chemicals being black powder.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How did you
finally unite them?

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I don't
know how they did.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I was gone by the time they
would have united them.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.056 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, that's right.

00:10:15.056 --> 00:10:15.856 align:middle line:90%
You got wounded.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So you really didn't
see much action then.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Most of the action
that I saw on that planet was

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:84%
related to the working with
the indigenous, training them,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:84%
going out to remote
villages or remote cities,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
getting them prepared, so a
lot of the same things that

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:90%
we'd done before--

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
helping them with
stockpiling and helping

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
them to get
organized and be more

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
efficient in their
agricultural operations

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
or planning out
fallback positions,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.284 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And while you
were there, did you ever

00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:90%
make peace with the insectoids?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.406 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, I never went back.

00:10:54.406 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You never went back.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:90%
You don't know?

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.145 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:10:58.145 --> 00:11:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, so you were in
the space shuttle minding

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:84%
your own business,
and the insectoids

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:90%
hit you with a missile or what?

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't
trust our presence there.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we were humanoids,
and immediately we

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
were enemy, persona non grata.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And so our efforts
at trying to get

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
them united with the rest of
the planet were not working.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're
afraid and scared,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:84%
their first response
was to attack.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So that was what they
did, was when they saw us,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.910 align:middle line:90%
they would try and attack us.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.880 align:middle line:90%
They took me prisoner.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.790 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
first interactions

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.085 align:middle line:84%
that my unit had had
with the insectoids.

00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
understand, there

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
were similar occurrences
in other parts

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:84%
where the other
people were trying

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to reach agreeable outcomes
with the insectoids.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So we never know what
happens to this planet, do we?

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.014 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I don't.

00:11:58.014 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Sounds like
a rough ordeal.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, it was--

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
the decision I
made not to go back

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
was based on-- it was
definitely a nightmare

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:90%
amongst the nightmares.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.019 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you got blown up.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:90%
The space shuttle got blown up.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Did people die in
this total explosion?

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But you fortunately
didn't, but you lost limbs.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And they medevaced
you back to Mars,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.619 align:middle line:84%
where they used
advanced technology?

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They used
advanced technology

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:90%
to regrow and reattach limbs.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you regrew your arm?

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow, that's amazing.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the
process is not perfect.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Again, they're not God.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it didn't
totally heal it up?

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:90%
They fixed the bone.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
They replaced the bone,
but the tissue, the nerves,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:90%
some of the softer tissues--

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
it's still not a
perfect science.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot better than
the conventional medicine

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:90%
that we have here.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And you're still alive.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: And I'm still alive.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you got
medevaced to Mars.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:90%
So you're back on Mars.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.625 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I don't
remember most of it.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I was in a coma for a lot and
under the medical treatment.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And then once I
was out of the coma

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and started going
through the therapies,

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it they use, which
is another great benefit

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
of augmented and
virtual reality,

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is being able to use it
for medical treatments.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And being able to use it
because during the process

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of the therapies,
they're able to isolate

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
signals between your brain and
different parts of your body.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So they can help you
with identification

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
of limbs that are newly
attached or learning

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to reuse limbs or reacquire
the use of muscles or muscle

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.576 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you finally
got better, eventually.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I did.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.632 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And one more time--

00:13:55.632 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Back into the--

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Back into the fray.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And this time, you went
back to Planet Two.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I went back to
Planet Two, Callidus Three.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.391 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Which is a cool
thing because you're

00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
going to see the results
of what happened here.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, I got a chance
to see close hand what

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
some of the rebuilding
efforts were involved, some

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the effects on the
native population,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:84%
how the people really
felt. When after the end

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
of the war and they're not
being invaded and faced

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
with imminent death,
what do they think?

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:90%
How do they feel about it?

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.884 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And?

00:14:27.884 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were
mixed feelings.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
We had some sabotage issues.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the shuttle ports
was destroyed completely.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: By the indigenous?

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: By the
indigenous population,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
had sabotaged one of the
fusion bottles on the shuttle.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And when those
things go, I mean,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
it will destroy just about
anything and everything nearby.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.297 align:middle line:90%
So it's an antimatter explosion.

00:14:52.297 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And why did they do that?

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:90%
They're angry at you?

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
angry at what was

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.459 align:middle line:84%
happening to their
civilization, understandably.

00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their entire world
had been turned upside down,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:90%
shaken, stepped on, and rebuilt.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you taught
them how to kill.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.435 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there's got to be
some feedback on that too.

00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:15.768 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There's going to be
some backlash on that, yeah,

00:15:15.768 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.824 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Anything else that you
discovered on your return?

00:15:20.824 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Another
thing on my return

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is the sudden appearance
of livestock mutilations.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Really.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
most bizarre things

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that I'd come across in the
aftermath of the rebuilding.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
At first, we were worried
that the enemy had returned.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It was strange livestock
mutilations out

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere,
all the fluids gone,

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:84%
strange mutilations on the body,
no signs of wildlife or anybody

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
or anything else in the area,
and the sudden appearance

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:84%
of what I believe were either
etheric entities or another ET

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.026 align:middle line:90%
race that was there.

00:16:07.026 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That was doing the--

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That was doing this.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's all you ever
found out, was one of these two

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:90%
and that was it?

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't know why
they were doing it?

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Don't know why.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I suspected it was for
psychological reasons.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to torment some of
the population that was there,

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.375 align:middle line:84%
and that was one
way of doing it.

00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You think the
cattle mutilations

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that happen on Earth are
for the same reasons?

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I strongly believe that.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Because of some of the
negative consciousness,

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that it gets seeded into
the human population

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:90%
through those experiences.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what was life
generally like now?

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Before semi-rural, this
was all upended by the war.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So now, what is life
like on this planet?

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was very much
a rebirth of a phoenix,

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:90%
if you will, of a civilization.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
They came from their plowshares
to building cities and starting

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
to build off-planet
installations in orbit.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And helping them
do that and seeing

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:84%
that, it had its rewards
in and of itself,

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
seeing them rebuild and restart,
jump-start their civilization.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they became
a spacefaring race?

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a thing.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, well, they
were all still controlled.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But still to advance
that quickly, that's--

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were
helped, very much so.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
But to advance that
quickly is something else.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But you look at the advances
that we've made here on Earth

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:84%
just from the 1930s through the
'40s before things went black.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Very similar.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Very similar.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Anything else that you
noticed about this new society

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:90%
that is worth repeating?

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Their social
structures changed--

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.836 align:middle line:84%
very regimented,
almost militaristic.

00:18:12.836 --> 00:18:14.210 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot
of things that I

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
was proud of in seeing
get rebuilt and renewed,

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
but seeing those kinds of
changes was not one of them.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they were
building up their military?

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.213 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Whether they're
building up their military

00:18:28.213 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or not, seeing a civilian
population get regimented,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
even if they're not in uniform
or building up weapon systems,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:90%
it is somewhat disturbing.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very Orwellian, and to see
an almost police state created.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Fair to say that
that was the point?

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How long did you
stay on this planet trying

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:90%
to help out this time?

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was there helping
with the cleanup and rebirth

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
operations for another
couple of years.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Two years?

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mhm.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And was the
population happier or sadder

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
than it was when you
arrived the first time?

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Both.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
There had been a tremendous
amount of deaths after the war,

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and so there wasn't
a single person

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:90%
on the planet that hadn't lost.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And so there was that
underlying sadness,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and how do you
recover from that?

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%
That takes probably
a generation or two

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
before those kinds
of wounds get healed.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't
a single day that

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
went by that people weren't
reminded of the losses,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
even though they would see
new things or things being

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:84%
built and repaired, and
things getting new or better.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So there was both happiness
and sadness there.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And of course, we felt it.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:90%
We saw it.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can't help but feel for
them, at least I did anyway.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
soldiers that I worked

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:84%
with that were part of my
unit were of the same mind,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and that was one of
the driving factors

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
for us was to help improve
that, to help whatever way we

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:90%
could to make it better.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Could you rekindle
any relationships

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that you had from before
when you came back

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:90%
with the indigenous?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
They had me in a completely new
place, new area, new people.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
The people there were,
when we first arrived,

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.774 align:middle line:84%
were very open,
caring, thoughtful.

00:20:44.774 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:84%
They'd give you the
shirt off their back

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.815 align:middle line:90%
without a second thought.

00:20:47.815 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:90%
They had no subterfuge.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
When I returned as part
of the rebuilding process,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:90%
it was realpolitik.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%
It was in full force--

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
backstabbing, political
moves, and intrigue,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and this person doing that
bad thing to that person.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of the worst
political fraud

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and events that you see in the
mainstream media today, that

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
was what they'd
learned, unfortunately,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:90%
and part of the plan.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So in the end
when you did finally

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
leave the planet after
helping to rebuild,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:84%
did you feel that it'd been
a good thing or a bad thing

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:90%
that you had been involved?

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I felt good
in that I'd helped

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
them to rebuild a number of
the things that they'd lost.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I did feel the loss from
seeing all the realpolitik,

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
seeing it in action, seeing it
born, watching it rise and take

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:90%
hold of all their leadership.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before, they would
work together cooperatively

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.678 align:middle line:84%
without any thought or
care of any repayment.

00:22:03.678 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that when I left.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Was it top down?

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.636 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:22:08.636 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And so seeing that
was disappointing.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So did the indigenous
turn on you when you returned?

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, they did not.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
When we first returned
to help them rebuild,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
there were units
specifically dedicated

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to going around and policing up
some of the technologies that

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
were left on battlefields
from one side of the planet

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Their jobs were to collect
not only the dead aliens,

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
but also the dead human
or humanoids, or mark,

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:84%
at least mark their location
so that any families,

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
if they were
surviving, would know

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:90%
where to go for the remains.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Part of the job was to
collect technologies

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that were spread and laid
out and strewn everywhere

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
from one corner of the
planet to the other.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge black
market in the technologies,

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.550 align:middle line:84%
the alien technologies,
alien biological life,

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and planetary
government was real

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:84%
worried about
collecting all of that

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and having control over it.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So the people that
were still there,

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
because they did develop
a burgeoning underworld,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
if you will, a criminal element
for these black market items,

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
the people that
we dealt with were

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
very interested in making
sure that they didn't

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.460 align:middle line:90%
take control or get control.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So these indigs had
a barter system before,

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
but now they've
developed a black market.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's an indication
of the economy deepening.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The economy
deepening and broadening.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The supply and demand economy
that they've been set up with

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
was based on manufacturing
goods and manufacturing

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in an economy based on a fiat
currency, in which you worked,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.054 align:middle line:84%
you made money, and
you bought things.

00:24:03.054 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
You worked, you made
money, you bought things.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you
can't buy something,

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:84%
or what if you want something
that's not readily available?

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, they've had
their eyes opened to,

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:90%
what are these alien things?

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:90%
What can they do for us?

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can
tinker with them.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
bulk of the black market

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
interested in doing.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that there were
off-planet corporations that

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:84%
were extremely
interested in attaining

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
additional alien
biological stock,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:90%
as well as alien technology.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
We boxed up, by the
thousands of tons,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
of alien biological samples,
as well as alien technology,

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and shipped it off planet.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
They told us it was going
to R&D bases on Mars.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I can guarantee you that was
not the only place they went.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And so my suspicion is that
there were also corporations

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
there, probably from
Earth and/or Mars.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So were you
given special training

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.770 align:middle line:84%
before you went to
these planets to make

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:90%
sure you blend in better?

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Part of the training
regiment that we went through

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:84%
before planetfall included
a tremendous amount of time

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
in neural education
chairs, in which we

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.770 align:middle line:90%
were downloaded the language.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
We were downloaded what
they called a package.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And it included the
intelligence that they

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:84%
were willing to share with
us about the civilization,

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
the people, and as part
of that neural download

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
included some of the things
that we would go through

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
or that were regional.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Cultural.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Cultural
sayings, information.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Clothing.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Clothing.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Art.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Art, yeah, the
dos and don'ts, nuances,

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:90%
as far as what they knew.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Now where did they get
this information from?

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that they
probably got it

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
from the Draco, who'd
been there for a long time

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and at least had feelers out
to be able to have collected

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We know the Cabal
doesn't trust the Mars Germans,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and we know the Mars Germans
don't trust the Cabal.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.790 align:middle line:84%
They're in an uneasy
alliance, clearly.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Is there a chance of
a war breaking out

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:90%
between the two of them?

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that the fact
that the Mars Germans still

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
called the Cabal Earth
[INAUDIBLE] royals

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:90%
is plenty enough.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Now the protocols preventing
the use of Earth troops

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
against Earth, I certainly
hope that that would never

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:90%
come to pass.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you
that the blockade that

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.670 align:middle line:84%
is preventing the
passage of ships

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:84%
into our solar system, at
least until the near future,

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
decides what and where and how
things are going to happen,

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:84%
would prevent a
bulk of their navy

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:84%
from coming and taking part
after the event or the changes

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:84%
that we expect to happen
sometime in the next decade

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Who's to say?

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Will humanity be united?

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Will it not matter that there
is a breakaway civilization that

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:90%
lives on Mars?

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Those are questions
that we need to address.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:84%
My suspicion is that
there probably are

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things going on now.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:84%
The animosity between
them has always

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:84%
been kept barely
contained because one

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:84%
believes the other is
below them or beneath them.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And so those battles
that are ongoing,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:84%
are they between Earth's
SSP and the Mars Germans,

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:84%
or are they between
German factions?

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Because not all the Mars
Germans are spiteful of Earth.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
My friend Johan is a
clear example of that,

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and I had met others.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Granted, they were a small
percentage of their military,

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:90%
but they're there.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.237 align:middle line:84%
You can't judge all
of them by that.

00:28:18.237 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: We got to be careful
because things are not

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.755 align:middle line:84%
as monolithic as
we think they are.

00:28:21.755 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They are not.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.922 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It's easy to think
that way, but it's not right.

00:28:24.922 --> 00:28:25.721 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:28:25.721 --> 00:28:26.749 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:28:26.749 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you think you have
someone watching over you?

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, I know
that the creator is

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:90%
watching over me every second.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And part of my mission has been
to experience the things that I

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
have and to tell
the stories of those

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that gave the ultimate
sacrifice, as well as those

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that have come back and
just don't remember it.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's my mission as
part of what I'm here for.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, Jason, it's been
really great having you on.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.103 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thank you for having me.

00:28:56.103 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:90%
It's all about disclosure.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It is.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm Jay Weidner,
and thanks for watching.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.510 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.500 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that you see today
that's electronic has something

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:84%
in it that we did not
find out for ourselves.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Once the memories
started coming back,

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
it shed a whole new light on why
there were people watching me.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> They'd been trying to modify
the environment and the planet

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:90%
for the Draco open rule.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:41.739 align:middle line:90%
