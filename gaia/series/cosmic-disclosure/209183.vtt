00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are with Ricardo Gonzalez,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
author and researcher from Peru,
who has experienced multiple

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:10%
direct contacts with an
extraterrestrial species called

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:10%
the Apunians.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're talking about the
origins of contact protocols.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient hieroglyphics appear
to have shown contact with

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:90%
the ETs.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Even up to the recent
events of Roswell in 1947,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
which has been popularized,
has shown some sort of contact.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
How have contact protocols
changed over the centuries?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Certainly contact with these
beings comes from very ancient

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we've talked
about on other occasions,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
these beings have
different agendas.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:10%
Usually, these protocols of
contact and communication

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:10%
with them reside specifically
with those civilizations

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:10%
that are kinder or desire
contact with humans.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:10%
For civilizations that do
not want contact with us,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:10%
there are obviously
no protocols.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, as we've
talked before,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
there are different
agendas surrounding

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:90%
these beings' visits.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But here, I'm talking about
those extraterrestrial beings

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:90%
who do want contact with humans.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in that
type of relationship,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
there are contact
protocols or methods.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, those
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that do not wish to communicate
with us, in those cases, there

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:90%
are no protocols.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And all this, Emery, has
been around for a long time.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And it has remained to
some way to this day.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
If we look at, for example, the
stories of the ancient prophets

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, the way they
contacted higher entities

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
through preparation
with prayer, retreating

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
to special and remote places,
processing the information

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that they received
and then sharing it.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not much different from
current contact protocols.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
We find this in different
cultures around the world.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
With the protocols
of today, there

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
seems to be an emphasis made
by these extraterrestrial

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:84%
entities, so that
extraterrestrial contact groups

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
today may, in some way,
maintain communication

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:90%
with these entities.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
In reality, these
protocols are not

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
designed to be common knowledge
for humanity for everyone

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
to go out into the field to try
to contact extraterrestrials

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
work like that.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It is important to make these
protocols public in order

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
communication with these beings

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
works, but not to
irresponsibly encourage

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
the pursuit of
contact in the field.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
This full experience
should obviously

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
be approached more seriously,
starting with the concept

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that it is these beings who set
the agenda for the experience.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
With that said, Emery, there's
something very important

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:90%
within the protocols.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:84%
These protocols follow a
very particular pattern.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
It is based on awareness,
intuition, and the ability

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:90%
to elevate our frequency.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I would say
contact protocols have not

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
been conceived just to
have an external experience

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials, but also
a way to prepare from within.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I try to keep that focus
for contact protocols, which

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I reiterate have existed
for thousands of years.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
They were put into
practice already

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:90%
at the time of the 1950s.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of Peru
and several Latin American

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
countries, these protocols
are projecting an intention

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
of thoughtfully preparing for
contact with extraterrestrials

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:90%
were already being applied.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I've been doing this
with many groups in the United

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
States for more than 20 years,
where we have taken groups,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
especially, to Mount Shasta,
to practice concentration,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
meditation, projection
of positive intentions,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
to create the best conditions
for bonding with these beings.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And remember that I'm talking
about the beings we've met.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Human-looking beings who have
kind intentions towards us.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Those are the contact protocols.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
A methodology to create the
best conditions for liaisons.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Protocols based on
awareness and sensitivity.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like abracadabra,
and you apply these protocols,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and these beings appear.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I reiterate, they are methods
to create the best contact

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But these protocols
are associated

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
with the agenda and the
decisions of these beings.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there different types
of contact protocols that you

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:90%
could describe to us?

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There are different types
of protocols for coming

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%
into contact with these beings.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:84%
These protocols can
change according

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to the context and the
kind of experience that

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:90%
could be developed.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
For example, something I've
seen in the United States

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is that the protocols that
they're putting into practice

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to contact
extraterrestrials, which

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
are very similar to
the ones we developed

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
in Latin America
many decades ago,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
are associated for the
most part with sightings

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%
of strange lights.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
A first approach
through UFO sightings,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
sometimes receiving mental
or telepathic messages

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
or capturing images of
luminous figures, probably

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the projection of these entities
with night vision equipment.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Or capturing images of these
entities through technology.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But contact protocols are
much broader than this.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
There are contact
protocols that apply

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:84%
to the projection of your subtle
vehicle into other realities.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:10%
I don't just mean what
is called remote viewing

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:10%
or the projection of your
consciousness to another place,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:10%
but to the total detachment of
your physical body to connect

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:10%
with other realities.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
There are also protocols
that are associated

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:90%
with dimensional portals.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:84%
A topic we have discussed on
a previous occasion, where

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:84%
in addition to the
intention or meditation,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
in the case of
dimensional portals,

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
a lot of active
consciousness is required.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Not entering those vortices
in a state of meditation,

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
but in active consciousness,
because the vortex

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:90%
is meditation so to speak.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And also within the protocol
for this type of contact,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
there as a physical preparation
that even includes diet,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
to make your body
as subtle and less

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
stressed as possible
before being

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:90%
exposed to these energies.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
types of contact

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and different
types of protocols.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Ricardo, can we
initiate contact,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.530 align:middle line:84%
or is it only
offered by the ETs?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to answer this
question because you can't say

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:90%
yes or no.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It depends a lot on the
contexts and the beings

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:84%
with whom you are
in communication.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
According to my contact
experience and my own research,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
you can create the contact
conditions, try to initiate it,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it can work
if these beings agree,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:90%
or it is part of their agenda.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Think about it this way.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
If contact witnesses
could always

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
initiate the contact
themselves, the behavior of UFOs

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
would not be so
elusive, so fleeting.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
They behave in that
way because they

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
try not to encourage
us to be dependent.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:84%
They have a greater perspective
on how to manifest themselves,

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and they follow very specific
manifestation programs

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
that humans do not understand.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So we could try to
contact them if we like,

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
but we would have to wait for
an answer from the other side.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So to a great extent, contacts
are programmed by them.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Many contact groups have
flocked to the desert

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
or to the mountains,
seeking out sightings

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of phenomenon
with these beings.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And they have said, I was here
on this mountain with Ricardo

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Gonzalez a few months ago.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's do awareness,
concentration, meditation

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's prepare our cameras
and our laser pointers.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And we will observe the sky
in the state of meditation

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to see if these
beings answer us.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And some groups have
spent hours or days.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And they have seen
absolutely nothing.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And there are other people
who have gone for a picnic

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
on a mountain, playing the
guitar and being very happy,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
transmitting joy,
tranquility, happiness.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And an object
appeared above them

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and illuminated them
with great energy.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
There are also
groups that have gone

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to meditate to try to have
an experience, for example,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:90%
in the forest of Mount Shasta.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And they've had sightings,
and they videotaped them.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But this does not
happen in all cases.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So it is important to understand
that this is not a game, not

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.140 align:middle line:84%
entertainment, where
through a cell phone app,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
you can have contact
with extraterrestrials.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So what protocols do you use
when you go out with your teams

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:90%
around the world?

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> With my research team, we've
traveled to different places

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Throughout these almost 30
years of contact and research,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled to nearly
100 countries in the world,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen experiences
replicated in different places.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:10%
And when I've entered
into communication

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:10%
with the guardians
of those places,

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:10%
whether they are natives, or
for example, monks in the Gobi

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:10%
Desert, these wonderful and
sensitive people, lamas,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:10%
shamans, Indigenous
peoples, have

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:10%
followed the same protocols.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I was surprised.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to seem
very mysterious,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
but there are some things
that I shouldn't say publicly.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to share
some of the information

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that we had in this
contact experience.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the past,
our ancestors, the Indigenous

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
guardians who have had
contact with the universe,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
they have managed to
identify certain places

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that serve as vortexes,
so that these places are not

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:90%
forgotten.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:84%
They left marks or signs
that we have learned of

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and now know of.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It could be cave paintings,
or it could be petroglyphs,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:90%
writing on rock.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Also, the placement of stones
in a purposeful, organized way,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
that marked certain places,
where there were contacts

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
or where the pulse of the
Earth's energy is at work.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
When we approach
those kinds of places

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
at the suggestion of
these protocols delivered

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrials, we
follow a careful diet.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
We eat very light and
very healthy at least

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
3 days before
approaching these places.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to those
spots that have been marked,

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
we do concentration and
meditation practices.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:90%
And we try to establish contact.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:84%
In those places, communication
flows more strongly.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Another type of protocol
that we apply is sound.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Something that in US
groups is not applied much.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of sound?

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Through mantras, through the
vocalization of certain codes

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:90%
or certain words.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Codes that have been received
through automatic writing

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
or communication
with these beings.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to ancient
mantras from India or Tibet

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that are well known and help
harmonize groups of people.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:84%
There are many
scientific studies

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that show how mantras generate
powerful psychological effects

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
on people, allowing people to be
attuned, focused on a purpose.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And through sound they
raise their frequency,

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:90%
their vibration.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
The issue in the United
States from what I've seen

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is that some extraterrestrial
contact groups

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
try to live these
experiences, but shy away

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
from doing sound or mantra
exercises because they see it

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.030 align:middle line:90%
as a religious thing.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:84%
This is bias, which I admit
I also had in the beginning.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But it is one of
our main techniques.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I remember that in the
Chilca Desert in Peru, which

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
is very famous in the
world for the UFO sightings

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that are recorded there,
we did a mutually agreed

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
upon experiment with
extraterrestrials.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
If I remember correctly, we
lived this experience in 1995.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:10%
We approached a
certain area close

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:10%
to the beach that
is along the coast.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And on a large rock
wall, a bright haze

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
emerged, as if the rock was
emitting a phosphorescence.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And we thought clearly
that energy, that anomaly,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and the extraterrestrials
had told us

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
that it was an
experiment with us.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And they opened a wrinkle, a
kind of portal on that rock

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:90%
there in Chilca.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
These beings told
us to concentrate

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:90%
on that portal they had opened.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And they alone would
open it, but they

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:90%
weren't going to keep it open.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:10%
They suggested to
us through messages

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:10%
that we should stand in front
of this luminous anomaly

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:10%
and concentrate on it
and recite mantras,

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:10%
meditating and vocalizing
at the same time.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:90%
And we started doing that.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And while we were focusing
and vocalizing the mantras,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
the vortex remained
bright and constant.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But if any member of the
group got distracted or tired

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and stopped
vocalizing the mantra,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that energy began to
waver somewhat and fade.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm embarrassed to say
this, but we were only

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
able to keep it going
for about 10 minutes.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:84%
We ended up exhausted,
very, very tired.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Did this wall of
energy and the door,

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.470 align:middle line:84%
did you feel like it
maybe downloaded you,

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
or did you get more
energy from it?

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like you
became more lethargic.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
This energy field was opened by
these extraterrestrial beings.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was somehow
connected to us.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So as we felt, or thought,
or followed these protocol

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
practices, the anomaly reacted
as if we were united with it.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the basis
of contact protocols.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
When you have a contact
with these beings,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
or you enter into these
dimensional portals,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
you are not alone anymore with
your thoughts and your energy

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
You enter a kind of
beehive of consciousness

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
where these beings are inside
you, and you are inside them.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
That is why they insist that
we raise our consciousness,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
our frequency, in order to
maneuver appropriately and not

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You talked about contact
protocols with individuals

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and groups.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
government's covert protocols

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:90%
through their agencies.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:90%
What are they utilizing?

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We've talked about this
issue privately, Emery,

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and you know very well
that this happened.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:84%
According to the
information I have,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
agencies dedicated to
investigating these phenomena

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%
have realized that they
are limited by technology,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and they try to explore
the human psyche regarding

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:90%
these phenomena.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:90%
This is not something new.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:90%
It's been going on a long time.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
The experiments that were
done during the Cold War,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:90%
for example, are very famous.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But today's agencies
have been able

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate contact
groups with agents

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
to see what the dynamics
are of their exercises,

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:90%
their practices.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:84%
How sightings, experiences,
or the manifestation

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:90%
of dimensional portals occur.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Although it may
surprise you, I've

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:84%
received emails from people
linked to these agencies.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I have renowned
investigators as witnesses

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm telling you.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to accompany
me in my research

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
around the world to see
how this phenomenon worked.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, I refused, but
that doesn't stop anything.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Because they continue
with their investigations.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that they
are specifically

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
interested in the location
of the places of contact,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
to see how they
transform and how

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
they change with some stimuli.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
How to absorb energy
for their experiments.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.960 align:middle line:84%
If this were to allow
them some breakthrough

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
in their laboratories and
their study of physics

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
or even human
consciousness, connecting

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:90%
with Earth's vortices.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
There are agencies that
have attempted contact

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But they are forgetting
something elementary.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much
of all this knowledge

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that they absorb and
develop great technology

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
in their secret
labs, if they do not

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
have good intentions, whatever
they do, whatever they learn

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:90%
will be in vain.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree, Ricardo.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
They have to have
the intention of that

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
love to not hurt and be peaceful
to go amongst the stars again.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you define the J. Allen
Hynek typology and how that

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:90%
relates to close encounters.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:10%
>> As we all know, Dr. Hynek
was the father of ufology.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:10%
A great scientist.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
He first started
out as a skeptic

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:84%
due to his academic
background and collaborated

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
with the US Air Force to
investigate UFO sightings.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Dr.
Hynek became convinced

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of the reality of the phenomenon
and that many witnesses

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
in the world were coming
into contact with something.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:90%
He admitted it publicly.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I gave a lecture, and
Paul Hynek, one of his sons,

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:90%
participated in it.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
He is a dear friend
and a great researcher.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And we discussed the typology
that his father created

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
to understand close encounters.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:84%
A typology based initially
on three scenarios.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:90%
It is simple, very simple.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
The close encounter of
the first kind, which

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:90%
is the sighting of the object.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:84%
The close encounter
of the second kind,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
when there is another type of
interaction with the object,

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:84%
like physical
evidence, a landing.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And the close encounter
of the third kind,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
when the witness comes face to
face with the being associated

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:90%
with that object.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was precisely this third
category of close encounters,

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
physical contact,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that inspired a
20-something Steven

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Spielberg to make
his famous film,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Close Encounters of the
Third Kind, where Dr. Hynek

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.460 align:middle line:90%
participated as an advisor.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
In my humble opinion,
the best film about UFO

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon of all time.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:84%
If there are young people
who are watching this show,

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that you see it
because more than a science

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
fiction film, it is
a historical document

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that also reflects some
of the contact protocols.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be a spoiler for
those who may not have already

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
seen the movie,
but the film shows

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:90%
at least two classic protocols.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.230 align:middle line:84%
One of them, the
harmonization of contact

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
through sound, which
we have discussed

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:90%
on a previous occasion.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
That in the wake
of a sighting that

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
occurs in India and
a sound that arises

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
from the ship that had appeared,
a mantra arises in people.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that
these people interpreted

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:84%
the sound, the vibration
of the ship as a mantra.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And then that sound was the
key to the contact happening

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
on the mountain at
the end of the film.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Sound, vibration is
a contact protocol.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's also another
element of contact protocol

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:90%
in Steven Spielberg's film.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Watch for signs that show you
the place where it will occur.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.630 align:middle line:84%
These signs can be
very powerful and can

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
evoke an almost irrational
impulse in the contactee

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:84%
because you are being summoned
to a particular place.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
This was depicted very
well in the film, when

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:84%
there were people painting the
mountain where the contact was

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
going to happen or other people
who took everything they could

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
find around, dirt,
mud from pots,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to practically create
a sculpture of the mountain.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And finally, that is
where the contact was.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:90%
But no more spoilers.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I will reiterate.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
This film is a
historical document

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
about close encounters and
not just science fiction.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Two real quick
things, Ricardo.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the main scientists
in there was playing Hynek,

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
is that correct?

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And didn't the President
of the United States

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
have a private showing
with Spielberg?

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And could you comment
on what he said to them,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
or do you know what he
said, you want to say it?

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I know there were private
screenings of the film

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:90%
for important authorities.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
a lot of information

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:84%
circulated about what
these authorities said

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:90%
about the film.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Even as you say, the President
himself was involved.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
According to the information
I have, and I'm sorry,

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.080 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to let
another spoiler slip,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
there's a scene in the movie
where extraterrestrials return

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
people who had
disappeared in plane

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:90%
crashes or strange phenomena.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, this
really happened.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was a historic
exchange at a US airbase.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And quite simply, the
film tried to depict that.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I see that you are
informed about that.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
But Hynek's typology
was expanded.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Not only are there
three types of contact

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:90%
according to the typology.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is that continuation
of the Hynek typology?

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1977, there was an
important ufology conference

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:10%
At that time, important
researchers and scientists

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:10%
such as Dr. Jacques Vallee
and Dr. Hynek participated.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Already in those years, the
Hynek typology was well known.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:90%
His research was far reaching.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:10%
So a renowned researcher
from Argentina, Fabio Zerpa,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:10%
who also participated as a
lecturer at this conference,

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:10%
told Dr. Hynek that the
typology of close encounters

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:10%
had to be expanded.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
He told Dr. Hynek, we
have close encounters

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
of sightings, landings, and face
to face encounters with beings.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But what about when that
contact happens inside ships?

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
In which of the three
typologies does this

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.370 align:middle line:84%
fit because close
encounters of the third kind

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
is the display of the entity
associated with the object,

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
but you are not
inside the object

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
because there are many
cases of witnesses

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:90%
who entered these ships.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Then Dr. Hynek
admitted in private

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
that his typology of
cases had to be expanded.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Then Fabio Zerpa suggested
two more categories.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Close encounters of the fourth
kind, when the witness enters

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
the ship, and close
encounters of the fifth kind

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
or psychic communication
with these beings,

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:84%
like telepathy or the
power of intention

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
of groups working to attempt
communication with them.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:84%
All this was published
in those years

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.780 align:middle line:84%
in Fabio Zerpa's ufology
magazine in Argentina

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and also in several books.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So the creator of the term close
encounter of the fourth kind

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and fifth kind was Argentine.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is not common
knowledge in the United States.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do you see contact
going as we move into the world

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:90%
of disclosure?

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I think contact intentions
by civilians are important.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Not seeking the experience
with extraterrestrials

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:84%
in a crazy way because,
as I have explained

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
throughout this
interview, there are

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
many factors that contribute
to the possibility

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:90%
of that contact.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Some factors are beyond
us, such as the very agenda

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:90%
of these beings.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
However, I believe that
seeking out contact

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is appropriate, at
least as a first step

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:90%
to open our consciousness.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Interest in establishing
communication with other worlds

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I consider to be positive
in terms of intention

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
because it speaks of
acceptance by a human being,

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that you are not alone
in this universe,

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
establish an exchange

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:90%
with other cosmic cultures.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Later, we could also
discuss whether the way

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
you want to establish
contact is ideal or not.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
The dangers, the dynamics,
and the list goes on.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But intention is
the powerful thing

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
because we are talking
about open mindedness.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is positive for
extraterrestrial manifestation

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
in the world because the
more open minded people there

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
are on the planet who consider
extraterrestrial contact

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:84%
a reality, we will
be more prepared

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
for a definitive manifestation
that we are not alone.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:90%
And I think we're on our way.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Many decades ago, the discussion
of life in the universe

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:90%
was practically absurd.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But opinions are changing,
even through statements

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
of prominent scientists,
through statistics,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
or through the study of
the possibilities of life

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:84%
We may not be alone
in the universe.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But if these beings exist,
they haven't made it here yet.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's also changing now.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Different surveys that
prestigious universities

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
have done show that
a large percentage

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:84%
of the population polled
consider that we are not alone

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, but that these
beings have not yet visited us.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:90%
So everything is changing.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, we've
moved on to a third question.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're not alone
in the universe.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And maybe these beings
could reach Earth.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:90%
But if they come, they are bad.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Avoid contact with them.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:84%
As Stephen Hawking
himself said at one time,

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a mistake to
put all these experiences

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and these interpretations in
the same bag as I said before.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So there will be a
great manifestation.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't know when
it's going to happen,

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
but this extraterrestrial
manifestation

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is starting with people
searching and their desire

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
to make contact
because the time has

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:84%
come to embrace each
other again as a family,

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.297 align:middle line:90%
as our cosmic family.

00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Ricardo, thank you for
being on the show again.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Then I saw a small object,
like a kind of metal egg

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:90%
in the garden.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It had a luminous opening,
as if a door had been opened.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And out of it came a child.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And this child, with big
eyes and a very tender gaze,

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
told me that he had
come from the stars

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and that he wanted
to be my friend.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
This is how my contact
experience began.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:38.442 align:middle line:90%
