00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:21.169 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: We're
here with John Lear.

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.628 align:middle line:10%
And today we're
going to be talking

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:10%
about Secrets of the Moon.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:10%
John, for the longest time,
I've been studying the moon.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And after going
through the projects

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and being in the Air Force,
I came to the realization

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that there's definitely a lot
going on up there that they

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:90%
don't want us to know about.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN LEAR: The
moon is a spaceship.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
It was built on Jupiter
about 38 million years ago.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And between the
time it was built

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and 15,000 years ago,
it's been touring

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:90%
around our solar system.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Our solar system, we're told
by NASA there's nine planets.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:90%
There's actually 40.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:90%
There's the Earth plus 39.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And each of those planets
has a civilization

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and each of those planets has
moons that have civilizations.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
going on out there

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that we could not possibly
grasp how much is going on

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:84%
There's so much air
traffic control.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's fantastic the amount
of trade that goes on,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
both technologically
and sociologically.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing all the
stuff that's going on.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So it was made on Jupiter.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: By who?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:90%
By what race?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.012 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: By I didn't know.

00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Just some
ET race, yeah?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And it's
been towed around

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to the different moons doing
exactly what it's doing now.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is monitoring
whoever lives on there

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and abducting or doing whatever
it is they would like to do.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't have its own
propulsion, it has to be towed.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And our moon was towed into its
orbit now about 15,000 years

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
ago just after the Ice
Age, the last ice age.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.205 align:middle line:84%
And when man first
became aware of the moon

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:84%
or aware of the skies,
there was no moon

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and then there was two moons
and then there was one moon.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And we think that the two
moons was the vehicle that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:90%
towed our moon into space.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:10%
There's a guy named Norman
Bergrun, who's passed away now.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:10%
Very knowledgeable, had
so many degrees and works

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:10%
with so many of our
aerospace companies

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:10%
doing different things.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Los
Altos Hills, which

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
was south of San Francisco
and worked at Lockheed.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Retired in 1986.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And got a hold of
some of the Voyager

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.223 align:middle line:90%
photos of Saturn's rings.

00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote the
"Ringmakers of Saturn."

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Is that about the fuel, the
fuel coming out the rings?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:90%
The spaceship.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.588 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The spaceship, yeah.

00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: There's three
of them that he saw.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:10%
And one of the biggest is 30,000
miles long and 2,400 miles

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:10%
in diameter.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I thought it'd be
really neat to meet this guy.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote him
and I just happened

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
to be going to the UFO
conference in San Jose in 2005.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went by his
house, met him,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and we became friends, very
good friends over the years.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he passed
away a couple years ago.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the back part of
the "Ringmakers of Saturn,"

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
he discussed how
the moon was towed

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:90%
into its orbit and his proof.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And his proof is that
Mare Orientale, one

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:84%
of the craters on the back
is not actually a crater

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's a place, it
has concentric rings.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks that's where
they grabbed onto it.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And he proposed that an EMV,
electromagnetic vehicle,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:90%
towed it into place.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, where do
you think it is now?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I think they
parked it on the far side

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
until they're ready
to use it again.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:10%
So I started looking for
it and found it immediately

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:10%
on the crater Tsiolkovskiy.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:10%
And Tsiolkovskiy
is on the far side.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It has a very
interesting history.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
NASA has airbrushed, completely
changed the character

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:90%
of that crater eight times.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
absolutely for sure

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that that is the
electromagnetic vehicle that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:90%
towed the moon into orbit.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, we wanted to
go to the moon forever,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
but we have this Van
Allen Belt, which

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:90%
is in place around the Earth.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
We sent three
rockets into space.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:90%
They all had Geiger counters.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Two of them worked and
gave us the readings,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
tremendously high
readings of radiation.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:90%
No way could we penetrate it.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's two belts, one that
goes from 500 to like 10,000,

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and the other goes
from 10,000 to 25,000.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Very, very lethal.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:90%
No way could mankind do that.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So I talked to him
about that also.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.313 align:middle line:90%
And the moon has a civilization.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
There's humans
that live up there.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, everybody
says, oh, well, then we

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:90%
did go to the moon.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.412 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, right.

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:22.495 align:middle line:90%
That was my next question.

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: We aren't the only
humans in this universe.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there any
earth humans there?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.606 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Not that I know.

00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:32.116 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They've picked up
thousands of earth humans

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and taken them there for visits.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
One of whom was
Howard Menger in 1956.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:10%
Howard Menger wrote a book
called "From Outer Space

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:10%
to You."

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I read the book, I
thought it was really great.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Found out that not only
he was invited up there,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:84%
but there was a number of
other people, scientists

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.633 align:middle line:90%
and other people with him.

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:57.925 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: For the United States?

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Or was it a group of--

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.565 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Different countries.

00:05:59.565 --> 00:06:01.857 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Different countries
were all grouped together.

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And they told him that they had
been doing this for a hundred

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:90%
years, taking people up.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.938 align:middle line:84%
But of course, nobody
wants to tell that story

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
because no one's
going to believe it.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And he became an
advisor to the Pentagon

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
when he got back
because he knew so much

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:90%
about what was going on.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
They took him there
for two weeks.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:84%
First week is spent
going into decompression

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
because the breathable
atmosphere is

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
equal to about 15,000 to
18,000 feet here on Earth.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if they were
just to plop you down there,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:90%
you would have a problem.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is
gradually decompress them

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:90%
until they're used to that.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And then they bring them
down and they take them

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:90%
all around the moon.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a train that travels on
what he calls a copper highway.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't know how it
goes, but it's very silent

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:90%
and goes very fast.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
When they go out in the
desert, the train stopped

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and they were allowed to
stand out at high noon

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to see that it wasn't
as hot as NASA says.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And just very nice
people, very advanced.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And like I say,
they've taken thousands

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:90%
of people over the years.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
People don't say
that, won't tell

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.492 align:middle line:84%
their story because they know
that they won't be believed.

00:07:14.492 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, no
one's going to believe.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: One of which,
the daytime sky,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.743 align:middle line:90%
the color is saffron yellow.

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I heard
about this, yeah.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And I wrote
to him and sent him

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
six shades of saffron
yellow and asked

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
him to put an x on the shade
closest to the daytime color.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
That's another reason why
we didn't go to the moon

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
because NASA, all their
photos are black skies.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I know.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.252 align:middle line:90%
I was going to talk about that.

00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what do you
think about that?

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.615 align:middle line:10%
And do they fake the whole--

00:07:48.615 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: And like Chang'e 4,
the Chinese just put up there,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a couple of pages on
what a ridiculous set of photos

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:10%
that was.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, they've got shadows
going every which way on it.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Of course, all
these pictures from the ISS

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and from satellites never have
stars in the background either.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Because they're just all--

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Because, you know, a
lot of those pictures are fake.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we
see from the moon

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
basically all come from
the Lunar Orbiter series.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Boeing built that
camera and spacecraft.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And five of them were launched
between 1965 and 1967.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And they took thousands
and thousands of photos

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and developed them as
the craft was in orbit.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
And then they crashed
into the moon.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:90%
There's fantastic pictures.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I, by complete sheer accident,
have collected about 35

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
have been airbrushed,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
but we can see more than
any body else would.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
That picture right down there by
the electric piano, Copernicus.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:90%
It was a photo taken on a angle.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fantastic
picture, but there's so much

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:90%
going on in there.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
talking about people

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, my
friend Bob Lazar, who

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
was the one that worked
up at S-4, he's skeptical.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.510 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't believe anything
unless he touches it.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was over at his house
going on and on about this.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I left,
he said, John, you

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:84%
realize now that if any
of this stuff is true,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to kill myself.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, let's
put that on paper.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So I've got that note
in my records here.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And it says, I,
Bob Lazar, promise

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
to kill myself if any of
John's moon stuff is true.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when I sent to NASA
to get that picture there,

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:90%
I was expecting an 8x10.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
But somebody, somewhere
along the line,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
sent me a 15x20
negative of that shot.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I never did find out who it was.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
But this was in the
early or mid '90s.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And in Las Vegas, there was
nobody that could give me

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:90%
a positive of 15x20 negative.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:90%
The technology didn't exist.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I had to wait
five years for the technology

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:90%
to get to Las Vegas.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And on the top right
side at the very top,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
there's what we call
the parking garage.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a three-story structure
about 300 feet in width.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has a ramp
on the side that

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:90%
looks like it's a parking ramp.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So as a joke, we call
it the parking garage.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So I took the 15x20
over to Bob's house.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at
it and says, damn.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're right, John.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that's
a natural thing.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, Bob.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've been friends
for a long time.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know I don't want to do
anything that would upset you,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
but you did promise
to kill yourself

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
if any of my moon
stuff was true.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, how
can I get out of it?

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, just
take this piece of paper

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:10%
and write, I, Bob
Lazar, in return

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:10%
for not having me
kill myself do readily

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.175 align:middle line:10%
admit that there was a building
on the top part of Copernicus.

00:11:27.175 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are they
doing up there on that moon

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.492 align:middle line:90%
that you've heard of?

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: They farm, they
do technological stuff,

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
they build stuff,
they trade the things

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that they produce with the other
planets in our solar system.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like Earth.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But they don't fight or
have any wars or anything

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:90%
or no social problems like that.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything is organized,
everybody gets along.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a really,
really nice place.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:90%
They welcome Earth people.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
They actually go
down and get them.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want
to associate with them

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:90%
or try and change their ways.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're just
the solar system morons.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:90%
If they evolve on our own here.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And they
send down spaceships

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:84%
from all the different
planets to look at the morons.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like a zoo.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Boy, you're not going to believe
what we saw on Earth today.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
a war going on.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.761 align:middle line:90%
They sit there and, ha, ha, ha.

00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So on the
moon, there are humans.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because in my work,
I've seen so many human ETs.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is just
off a little bit.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:90%
But they look just like us.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're just like us.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And who are these humans and
how long have they been there?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.875 align:middle line:90%
Is this just an ongoing project?

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well, as I
told you, the people

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that made us made a billion
other civilizations of humans

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.495 align:middle line:90%
on different planets.

00:12:55.495 --> 00:13:00.115 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: John, what do you know
about the Germans and the moon?

00:13:00.115 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know, it's a
possibility that they went.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:90%
They did have help from ET.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.835 align:middle line:90%
They definitely had saucer.

00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I think
they were probably

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
one of the first to actually
hook up with extraterrestrials.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
They got help, but
apparently people

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
say that they lost the
war but won the peace.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they say
that is because they started

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:84%
with Operation Paperclip, which
the Germans came over just

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:90%
before the end of the war.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Knew we were trying to
build an atomic bomb.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
bomb but they didn't

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:84%
have the initiator and all the
other stuff to get it going.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So they came over
to us because they

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
knew that we had everything
else but the plutonium.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we'll
give you the plutonium

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:90%
we have so you can bomb Japan.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
All we ask is that you permit
5,000 Nazis citizenship

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.623 align:middle line:90%
after World War II.

00:13:58.623 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's how the
CIA got infiltrated by--

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: That became
Operation Paperclip.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was run by
John Foster Dulles,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:90%
who was Secretary of State.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:10%
Allen Dulles, his brother,
who was head of the CIA,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:10%
and Eleanor Dulles,
their sister,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:10%
who was head of the
Berlin desk for the US.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And they funneled these 5,000
people and probably more,

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
gave them citizenship,
and they began

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate in
the United States.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Took over NACA,
which became NASA.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.838 align:middle line:84%
And the only actual American
that was ever in NASA

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:33.755 align:middle line:90%
was the administrator.

00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:35.547 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Well, as soon
as Wernher von Braun

00:14:35.547 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:10%
came in, they just took all
the American scientists,

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:10%
said get out.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The story was that as
these 5,000 Nazis are being

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
infiltrated, Hitler
didn't commit suicide

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:90%
at the end of World War II.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Hitler first went to Spain
and then to Argentina.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And then somehow eventually
ended up in the United States.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Wasn't he
in Antarctica, too?

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:90%
He did go to Antarctica.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what he found.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Probably the same as us.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:90%
We were just told to get out.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Hitler died in
the United States,

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe, at the
Mayo Clinic in 1968.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But up until that time, he was
running the Nazi infiltration

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
of the United States, which
included Bell Helicopter

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and was the reason
for the Vietnam War,

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:90%
was the only reason.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
They faked the Gulf of Tonkin
incident, which never happened.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:90%
It was all bullshit.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And had their own
space command agenda,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.920 align:middle line:84%
starting with ripping off
Mercury and Gemini, which most

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:90%
of those flights didn't go.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:90%
And then Apollo.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And the whole program
for $40 billion,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:84%
which was the money they used
to start their own space command

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and was based at Kwajalein.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why have we not
returned back to space?

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: We never went, Emery.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:90%
We never went.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
The Apollo missions didn't
even orbit the moon.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:90%
It was all fake.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a tremendously
technological way they did it,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
but there's no possible
way that the Apollo

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:90%
missions could have gone.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we see the pictures that
the astronauts sent back.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Besides all the pictures
perfectly framed

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
from a Hasselblad
camera in the middle--

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.335 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right in the middle.

00:16:27.335 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Which they couldn't aim.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And every one is
perfectly framed.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Plus the fact that
all the little marks,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:84%
the regional marks are
all in different places.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just a scam.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the sky is
black in the NASA pictures

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and not black in
Staffron, when they

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.960 align:middle line:90%
landed at 10:00 in the morning.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So they had to come
up with a reason of,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
the camera was set
for the foreground

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't get the stars.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It was all BS.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%
You know?

you actually see

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.725 align:middle line:84%
the stars and the solar
corona in spite of the glare?

>>NEIL ARMSTRONG: We were
never able to see stars

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
from the lunar surface or on
the daylight side of the moon.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But I went out looking
for the optics.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall, during
the period of time

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that we were photographing
the solar corona, what

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.802 align:middle line:90%
stars we could see.

don't remember seeing any.

>>LEAR: And then the
astronauts' testimony

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
when the first of them, three
of them, the first interview

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
they had after the Apollo
11 had supposedly got back,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, all three
of them looked

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:90%
like they were scared to death.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't remember
whether they saw stars.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they said that,
you know, well, they

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:84%
saw it with the
sextants that they had

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:90%
to determine their position.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:84%
The computers they had
those days, they had what?

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:90%
30K?

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Is that your memory?

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:90%
All they had was 30K.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no way they're going to
determine an orbit even if it's

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:84%
pre-computed from taking off
from the moon to get into orbit

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.005 align:middle line:84%
and latch up with
a space module.

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you think
about the astronauts like Buzz

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and them who've
come back and said,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
when they arrived on the
moon, there was, you know,

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.875 align:middle line:90%
they were ready to greet us?

00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: That was a planted story
by NASA to be used in the event

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that nobody was
buying their story.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And they needed to
move in the there's

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
space aliens there to get
everybody interested in it.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But Neil Armstrong
never said a thing.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
His picture was never allowed,
he never allowed his picture,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and he never said
a word about it.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Buzz Aldrin, who did a
lot of talking about it,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and when he'd talk about
it, he'd get violently ill.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Those stories, I've
read all of them

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
about whenever he'd start to
talk about the Apollo missions,

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:90%
he'd throw up and get ill.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So whatever psychological
mind control they had in the--

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Psychotronics, right?

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Wasn't as
good as it is now

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:90%
because it's perfect right now.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.372 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what's
your take on that?

00:19:12.372 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel that happened
with those astronauts?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Disinformation campaign.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
As far as Apollo 17, that
gap where they supposedly

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:90%
went into the secret Nansen--

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
remember that crater?

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:90%
The Nansen crater?

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't die?

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:84%
It was all engineered,
it was like Apollo 13.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, they had the
problem and everybody

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
was worried if
they'd make it back.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
It was all bullshit
and nothing happened.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
they don't talk about a lot

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is the NASA guy
that was in charge

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
of exposing all the divisions
of the Apollo program.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:10%
And he and his family
were killed by that train.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:10%
Remember that train
wreck that they had?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was ready to
testify before Congress.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
They killed him.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:90%
They killed Gus Grissom.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about Gus Grissom

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:84%
was he was killed
on January 27, 1967.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And a month before that,
he had made a comment

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:90%
to the United States--

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:90%
or to the US press.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Standing at the command
module and he had hung

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:90%
an orange or a lemon on it.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this thing ain't
going to the moon in two years.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.867 align:middle line:84%
This thing ain't going
to the moon in 10 years.

00:20:22.867 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Because he was an
engineer and he knew

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:90%
how screwed up the program was.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
No possible way were they
ever going to go to the moon.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:90%
So they had to kill him.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And the way they
decided to do that

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.407 align:middle line:90%
was a fire on January 27, 1967.

00:20:37.407 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is they waited
until the seal was completely

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Then they had it triggered.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And Virgil Grissom's
son has that trigger.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Somebody gave it to him to show
how his father was murdered.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing about
the Apollo 1 command module

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
fire is there were
four people in there.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now usually, it was the
head of the Apollo program,

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to think
of the guy's name.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me his last name
was like Ladd or something

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this guy
had to be in Houston,

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:84%
so they put the
fourth astronaut,

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:84%
who was an astronaut
from the secret program.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
such a gap between the time

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that the fire was put out until
mass investigators were let in

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to get the bodies.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they had to go
in and get that body out

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.155 align:middle line:84%
so there's no questions about
what's he's doing-- who's that?

00:21:34.155 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's
what he's saying.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So that took them, you
know, like an hour and a half

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
to get in there, get the bodies
of Grissom, White, and Chaffee

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:84%
up, get the other guy
out, and then let them in.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
That's where that
discrepancy came from.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
bunch of guys killed

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.317 align:middle line:90%
to keep this thing a secret.

00:21:55.317 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So I was working at
the Space Coast Air Medical

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Institute, one of the
largest hyperbaric chambers

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
in Melbourne, Florida there.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The contract was
contracted out by NASA

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:12.420 align:middle line:84%
to do rapid decompression
for pilots and astronauts.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was developing
a system there,

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I invented the first
tabletop platelet rich plasma

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:84%
concentrator and stem
cell concentrator.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were always, you
know, these things, John, just

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.407 align:middle line:90%
like NASA itself.

00:22:26.407 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to build this,
we need all this money.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But they just use half
or a quarter that money.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The other money
goes you know where.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So they were telling me,
well, since you invented this,

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
we want you to go
up in the shuttle.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
We want you to go to
the Space Station,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:84%
try this out
because, you know, we

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
believe this will
keep the muscle mass

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying
to figure out how

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
to keep the body
from breaking down

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:90%
from deep space exploration.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.825 align:middle line:84%
There was a big budget
cut right about that time.

00:22:56.825 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:90%
It had to be Clinton.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And remember that big budget,
he just cut NASA right off.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:07.687 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness he did
because my return flight was

00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:90%
the one that blew up over Texas.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Oh, really?

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Then I found out 10, 15 laters
from an Admiral of the Navy,

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:84%
well, you were supposed
to be on that flight.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Everyone on that flight was
targeted for termination.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Wow.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well, when
the shuttle was going,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:90%
me and Ron Schmidt were--

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:84%
on the living moon
and were commenting,

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:84%
we were trying to
figure out why did it

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
take, after the
shuttle took off,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
two and a half days
to get to the ISS

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
when the Russian can
do it in 37 minutes?

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Why did it take--

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and the chief disinformation
agent for NASA, he always

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:90%
had the answer to everything.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And told us, well, obviously
you guys don't know anything

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:90%
about orbital mechanics.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:90%
You know, just pure bullshit.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But what we noticed was
that the Russians always

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:04.160 align:middle line:84%
launched a Vostok on the same
day that we launched a shuttle.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't figure that out.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
A Vostok towards the
International Space Station.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Then we started to get the
manifest from the Vostok.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was fruit and
vegetables and food and stuff,

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.030 align:middle line:84%
way more than they would have
needed on the International

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Space Station.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Then the shuttles get to the
International Space Station

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and they open the hatch
and there's only 25%

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:90%
of the space used.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So then we started
backtracking, you know,

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
well, they're taking stuff
up but where is it going?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:84%
It was all going to the stuff
that the Navy had in orbit.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:90%
The 13 DEWs, the foundries.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:84%
They have two foundries
up there making the D.D.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, the D.D
is the whole plate material

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.420 align:middle line:84%
for submarines and
aircraft carriers

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that is lighter than titanium,
stronger than titanium.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Then with a small
electrical charge,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
is able to keep the water from
five to seven centimeters away

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:90%
from the hull.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Which means they
can go with no drag.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the equation
for hull based boats

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
is 1.34 times the square root of
the waterline, which works out

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
to be about 45 knots,
which is all they say.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And last year,
when they launched

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:84%
several of the Block T,
or Block II submarines

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.030 align:middle line:90%
that are coming online now.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Then they would say, we have
some tremendous new technology

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in here, but they didn't bother
telling the public what it was.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So on my Facebook,
I told there's

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:90%
three parts of the technology.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they use fusion
engines instead of fission,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
which is a tenth the weight
and 10 times the power.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And they can use two
or three in place

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:90%
of having a fission engine.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that they've
got the D.D, which enables

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.308 align:middle line:90%
them to go 100 knots plus.

00:26:02.308 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's incredible.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want no one
to know that because we

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.305 align:middle line:90%
could be anywhere quick.

00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: How do they keep
the sailors from talking?

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing is they
don't let them go topside

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
when they're going.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing is Navy
guys don't talk about stuff

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:90%
that they're not supposed to.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:84%
They knew too many guys that
have gotten into trouble.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So when they're having to get
to some place 10 times faster

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
normally, they're not going
to go up to the command

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, something
doesn't fit right here.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:84%
If want a job, they're
keep their mouths shut.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
That's how they keep it secret.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
The third thing was the
prop jet that they used,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's a
propulsion system that

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
drives the propeller that's
quieter and more powerful.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And they hook those up to the
new battleships, too, now.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And that D.D is made
in the foundries

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.120 align:middle line:84%
that the US Navy
has because it's

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.848 align:middle line:90%
got to be made in a vacuum.

00:26:54.848 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it has to
be made in a vacuum.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And the way
they bring it down

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.560 align:middle line:84%
is about 10 years
ago, a friend of mine

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:84%
named Myles Johnson
sent me a picture.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
He work on towers
in Scotland and he

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.560 align:middle line:84%
happened to be on the top of
one of these towers at sunset

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and saw this thing fly over.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No way.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: And that picture--

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
look at that picture
behind you way up there.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:84%
He saw that triangle
coming over.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:10%
He said it was 10
times bigger than a 747

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and he said it took seven
seconds to get from straight

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:10%
up to the horizon.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And that he was working
right near Machrihanish.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And we know that Machrihanish is
some of this secret airplanes.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
they hide something

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:84%
10 times bigger than a 747, but
I know that ship was hidden.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So that was
the transport ship for--

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: The D.D. The big plate.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And about that time I'm posting
about this, one of the gals,

00:27:54.050 --> 00:28:00.290 align:middle line:84%
one of the mothers in
the UK who was on my page

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
said that her son
had just got back

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:84%
from a deployment with his
Navy and confirmed everything

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:90%
that I told them.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.615 align:middle line:84%
The D.D and using
the fusion engines.

00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How big is
that base up there

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:90%
that they're making the D.D?

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And how many man personnel
are you aware of?

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Up there?

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.022 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:28:21.022 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: It's between
1,000 and 1,500 astronauts

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:84%
current and qualified and
most of them in orbit.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.087 align:middle line:84%
So you could imagine there's
all kinds of stuff going on.

00:28:30.087 --> 00:28:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it's a huge
salvaging program, too.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:36.250 align:middle line:84%
What is in store for humanity
that is in relation to the moon

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.695 align:middle line:90%
and where is it going?

00:28:37.695 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Emery, you
know what's great is we

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:90%
don't have to worry about that.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, all we have to do is
live our life with integrity,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:90%
without envy, hate, or greed.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And having known
you for some time,

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure that you're in that.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I know that I'm in that.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I don't have
to come back here again.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's
just interesting.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure I'm here as a
volunteer, to give information.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe I've already
passed my life review

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just down here to
give information to people

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:90%
the best that I can.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm free.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.493 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty sure you are.

00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people down
here on their last trip.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I feel the same way.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And go by the same
standards, belief system.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, John.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to be here with you

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:90%
