00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're at an undisclosed

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:10%
location with Tim.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in the
covert government in Germany,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.768 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
interesting today.

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I am very excited.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:90%
So are the Greys our friends?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Or they are enemies
or something?

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the important
question because they have such

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:90%
a different mindset.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
We already talked
about that the Greys

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
have this kind of
agenda where they

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:84%
want to achieve the overall
evolution of the universe

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and doing it on the fly and
as effectively as possible.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So that is kind
of their mission.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:84%
They also benefit from
that because they gain back

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
a bit of their
evolution, and they

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:90%
can heal through that process.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:90%
But they also are pretty--

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:90%
they can be invasive at times.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And they can be hard to handle
because they show reactions

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that people on
Earth, for example,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
from their cultural
perspective are not used to.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, people in pop culture
really think they're malevolent

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:90%
creatures.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
interesting because they're

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
associated with the alleged
abduction phenomena.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're always portrayed
in movies and Hollywood

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:90%
as these evil entities.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
say about that?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand,
I'm already sad that we

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
have this earthly agenda that
portrays the Greys in movies;

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon of
non-terrestrials, in general,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:90%
as a threat.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot
of misinformation

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
from the '50s going on where
we had some institutes that

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
suggested it would be good
to put some fear upon Earth.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:90%
And also, as the Greys are--

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
well, they can be defined
as warrior species,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
even though I wouldn't
say that they 100%

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:90%
fulfill that criterion.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:90%
But they have enemies.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And they do not like the agenda
of the Greys and the claim

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that they want to be
part of everything

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and kind of create the
way the universe evolves.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe the Greys
have manipulated our DNA

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
at different points of history?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I know they have.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there
are about 12 species that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
have influences on the
genetics of human life forms.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots of
evidences in the human genetics

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and the way the
human has evolved

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
from a monkey species that
already show us that there's

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:90%
something going on.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
There are some
artificial elements that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:90%
show up very, very quickly.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, for example,
that humans on this planet show

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
behaviors that every
other animal doesn't show.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Also, the skin, the way humans
need to wear clothes and stuff,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
these are evidence that showed
that the evolution, the way

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
this monkey species has
evolved from an animal species,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been done naturally.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> There's this giant gap.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the giant gap comes
into being because they have

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
taken a species that they found
appropriate on this planet

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and they have infused their
own genetics into that.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And for what reason?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>They have some loss
on their spirituality

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and some bad karma, so to speak,
about the first master line

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:90%
that they needed to erase.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.422 align:middle line:90%
>> So they believe in karma?

00:05:01.422 --> 00:05:02.505 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I believe in karma.

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm saying--

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's your opinion.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happened is that
the first evolutionary line

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:90%
of the Greys--

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
a previous version

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:90%
of the universe--

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
it had come to a conclusion
that everything in the universe

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:90%
is only this one point.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And by focusing
on this one point,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
you lose all the
diversity of life,

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
which means the first
evolutionary master

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
line of the Greys came to a
level 6 consciousness in where

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
they were so isolated and
so alone and so devastated

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that they had nothing at
all that could complement

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:90%
their evolution.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
They only reduce themselves
on a mental process,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
which means everything
we experience was

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
compressed onto one thought
and kind of calculated

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:90%
artificially.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And diversity is
something that is

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
very important to the universe
because through diversity, we

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
all make these, kind of,
surprising experiences.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can evolve in
certain directions

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't evolve
into when we just

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
think it over and just
sit in a room meditating

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, yeah, OK,
I could do that, then I

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
benefit from that and stuff.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first previous
master line of the Greys

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:90%
that came so isolated.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And now they have
accepted the thought

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that they need a
diverse universe

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:90%
with all these creatures.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:90%
But they--

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.165 align:middle line:84%
>> But who created
the first Grey?

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are
different answers to that.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, of course,
source itself created itself.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But then again, probability
created the Greys,

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
which means in this previous
version of the universe--

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
outside of time--

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%
we have a probability
for the Greys to exist.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And that created the Greys.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
pure mental thought

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that created their belief
system and what they could do.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just the universe
thinking about being present

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and having experiences.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you reduce
all the wonders

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:84%
of nature and the universe
into just a mind concept,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
then you lose a lot of
practical hands-on experiences.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is why they
need to reach out to that

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and have all these experiences
through having other species

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.010 align:middle line:90%
making experiences.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Now's that's the driving
factor for them to expand

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
across all these universes
is what you're saying.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Very true, very true.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They needed a driving factor--
and we already talked about

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
which is in some kind
of stable frequency.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And why, for example,
other species

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:84%
have mother love as a driving
factor or other emotions that

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
are positive that makes
life worth living.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:84%
They have this thought of
solving problems could be fun.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they go out
and give administration

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:90%
to different stances.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So they believe
sound before form?

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a different concept.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They are very mentally
based, and they

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.945 align:middle line:90%
believe thought before form.

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I'm curious
because, are they more thought

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
based, frequency based,
harmonically based?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>> They're almost
purely thought based.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.780 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.944 align:middle line:90%
That gives me more of a--

00:09:15.944 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
as looking at this
as a ectobiologist--

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
because that shows me that they
are a little bit more AI than--

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:84%
or more advanced
civilization of a humanoid.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the Greys
have a different perspective

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:90%
on the universe.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And they do see the universe
more as a thought concept,

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:90%
of a mental concept.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The thought
concept of whose mind?

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So in the previous version, the
first master line of the Greys,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
the mental concept was
focused on just one observer.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:84%
That is why it got failed
because when you only

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
have one observer
that creates thoughts,

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
then everything that happens
inside of the universe

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:90%
is not diverse.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just based upon what
one consciousness focused

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:90%
point can imagine.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Now they have-- because they
already knew that they have

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
created three master lines,
which also created some kind

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:90%
of Fibonacci code--

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:90%
that's a different thing--

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
they benefit from the concept
that there are lots and lots

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:90%
of species out in the universe.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And every species is
different to another.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Every individual had their own
thoughts and belief systems.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And through that, they
establish diversity.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And through that, they can
gain evolutionary success.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you told me earlier
that they also not feed off

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:84%
of our emotions, but really look
down on us and want experiences

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:84%
through us that they download,
or they just look at us

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:90%
as a bunch of hairless apes.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] They
too are very hairless.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think there
are experiences

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that a human body can have
because it's a biological body.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
When we have this triad
of body, mind, and soul,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
we can see the body as a
fully functioning subjective

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:90%
and individual system.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
That is why, for example, when
you go to a roller coaster

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and you have this experience
and your mind knows,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's going down now,
and the body still reacts.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is the body
reacting to an impulse

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and it creates fun for humans
to experience this communication

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
between the biological
body on a roller coaster

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and the mind that forces that
body upon the roller coaster.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, then my
next question is,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.210 align:middle line:84%
since we're all on the
same roller coaster,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
can they connect directly to us
since we are all from one same

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:90%
source?

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they can.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can reach
out to everything

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because every point
in the universe

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:90%
is connected to one singularity.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That is the concept a lot of
those propulsion systems work

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of those mind
psychic abilities work.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But they also use technology
that they have created,

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and they're very good at that.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
They give a lot of the
technology to the Earth.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And so for that
reason, they have

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
created some kind of internet
all over the universe

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to move certain
bits of memory and pieces

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people out there
who claim through contact that

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:90%
what they believe in--

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
they were with a Grey
and had gotten pregnant

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and had this child.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on this?

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So one thing the Greys
did was to establish a school

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
of Greys, which means that they
take a lot of the freshly born

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
babies or younger children and
project them into some kind

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:90%
of school.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
We all know that the education
system that is here on Earth

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
is pushing some
kind of narrative

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:90%
and some kind of reality.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
way with the Greys.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So they educate, especially
children, in some kind of way

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
or another upon the, well,
the ideas and oneness

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.218 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Where does this
school take place?

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So mostly, and this
is especially true

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:84%
for the beginning of the
contact with the Greys,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:90%
it was pretty physical.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So they had some
insulation, some crafts

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:90%
where they took children onto.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And they educated them.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:84%
They showed them their signs,
their hieroglyphs, the history,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and the overall
understanding about how

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:90%
a connected universe works.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that
this is bringing up

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:25.960 align:middle line:84%
an alternative to the education
system that is here on Earth.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And there needed to be some
kind of restrictions to that.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>> How many of these hybrid
children are living on planet

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's some kind
of counting going on right now.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask
just my opinion, I

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:84%
think must be
thousands of people

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that have in some
kind of way or another

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
been influenced
by these programs.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And are these programs
all over the planet?

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> To my knowledge, yes.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they in a space?

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially in the
beginning, they were.

00:16:09.164 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They now use different
ways in order

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to communicate and to
coordinate those programs.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> As a tactical advisor,
in your experience,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
have you ever heard of
an invasion scenario

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:84%
that's potentially
coming from the Greys?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That is a very important
question because I've heard

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
people saying to me, oh, my god.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:90%
They want to invade the Earth.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And they made that very
clearly that they have

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%
no interest in this planet.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The way they look
upon this planet

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is that it's actually not very
well-functioning for preserving

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
life because on the
surface of Earth,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
you have all those
volcano activities.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:90%
You have winds.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
You have floods, hurricanes,
all these naturally occurring

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's
nothing that protects

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:84%
the Earth from potential
outside threats,

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:90%
like satellites or space race.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
These are all things that
do not exist in the planets

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:90%
the Greys inhabit.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:84%
They even have a fully
functioning electrical system

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.550 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So the planet doesn't
need another light source.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It glows for
themselves and stuff.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So they made it
pretty clear that they

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:90%
have no interest at all.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:90%
And they don't even--

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:84%
they can't imagine why
anyone would find it

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:90%
amusing to be on such a planet.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
This might also be
one of the reasons

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:84%
why all those people
went underground.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you perceive the
Greys in relation to humanity?

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If we take into consideration
that there is already

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
an established system on
this planet that actually has

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
the right to develop
on their own--

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
we come back to "the Greys
are invasive" thing--

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:34.820 align:middle line:84%
so that is something that
could be seen critical.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:90%
On the other hand, we know--

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and we're coming back
to that-- that there's

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
a lot of deception going
on with this system

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of species
do not even care

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
about the free will of something
or even the natural development

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:90%
of a system.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot talk about
a naturally grown system

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:84%
In that way, I think the Greys
offer another opportunity

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:90%
for some people.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people might feel attracted
to the way the Greys go

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:90%
with the flow of the universe.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Some others don't.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
a lot of people,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:84%
especially in the audience,
that do have this heartwarming,

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
spiritual connection and
are very natural beings

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:90%
connected to the universe.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Those beings will
not likely tend

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
to become member of
the Greys imperium.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Are interactions between the
Greys and other human beings

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:84%
being monitored by
other ET beings?

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And is there some sort
of diplomatic protocol,

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:90%
or vice versa?

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally, there is.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Not all of the
species, especially

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
those that have their own stocks
in the evolution of the Earth.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
They might not like the
invasiveness of the Greys.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I also think, from my
perspective and relationship

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:84%
to the governments,
that especially not

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the military likes everything
the Greys do because they have

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
their own style, their own
agenda, and Earth people

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:90%
like to do it their own way.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how do the ETs,
including the Greys,

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:90%
have access to humans?

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And how is that determined?

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Who determines that?

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The fundamental physical
point that makes it possible

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to have all these
influences is, of course,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:90%
the unity of the universe.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
connected to one point.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So if this one point,
this consciousness unit,

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
decides to project
out certain energies,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:90%
then they can do that.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot of technology and
a lot of psychic tricks

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:90%
are based on that.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, there
are lots and lots

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of techniques and
technologies that

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:84%
are being used by
different ET species.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And we have all these
reports, for example,

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
of people feeling influences
of different beings

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and different energies,
psychic attacks, or something

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that even militaries on Earth
have developed in the '70s

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and used and
probably still using.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So these are things that are
real, and they are being used.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
The problem of all this is that
if everything is connected,

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
if somebody does something
self-destructive,

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.520 align:middle line:90%
it destructs itself.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the criteria for
choosing a human being?

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, you might say that
a farmer in Minnesota has

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:84%
the same experiences of
abduction or encounter as, I

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
don't know, a businessman
in New York or something.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:90%
That can occur, and that occurs.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's based on frequency.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So we know, I think,
about from the '90s,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that every individual
has their own frequency

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:90%
that they project out.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is also included
the level of potential

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:90%
for certain evolutionary steps.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is the criterion
that ET species look for.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What frequency is
attracted to them?

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.985 align:middle line:84%
What characteristics
makes this person

00:23:10.985 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
different than that person?

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You might want to ask the
question why mosquito chooses

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:84%
somebody and the person
right next to him or her

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
isn't affected by
mosquitoes at all.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.492 align:middle line:90%
>> I can answer that.

00:23:27.492 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's similar.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking
about the Greys,

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.500 align:middle line:84%
they are looking for the
success of the timeline

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So they are looking for
things in the timeline

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency of
somebody that they

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
can rely upon to make their
own evolution more successful.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking about
other types of species,

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
for example, reptilian
species, that

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
tend to misuse the system
because they have more

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:84%
knowledge than the
average man on Earth,

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:84%
they are looking more
for people that they

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:90%
can subjugate in some ways.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that all
reptilians are like that.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
a lot of reptile species

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that certainly work together
with the governments.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have a beneficial
approach to that.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But there are some that are
looking for that frequency.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever heard of
the Greys picking off someone

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:84%
because of their lineage
or their bloodline?

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we're talking
about reptilian species,

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
some of them tend to choose
only people in power and in high

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:84%
education to either infiltrate
them or influence them

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:84%
because they want to achieve
influence in the power system

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The Greys tend to not be
interested in the power system.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:84%
They are looking for genetic
profiles and probabilities

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and also temporal lineages that
they can put their agenda upon.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is why they don't care
if it's a farmer from Minnesota

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%
or a businessman from New York.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you define what
a temporal lineage is?

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, they are
time-travel species.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So if they find that
somebody is dedicated

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:84%
to the Grey's system in some
of the temporal lineages,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:84%
so meaning in the
future or in the past,

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.280 align:middle line:90%
they will reach out to them.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> As we conclude this episode,
what message do you have

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:90%
for our viewers, Tim?

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> So don't be scared.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
If you do not want to
take on the opportunities

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys are
offering, then just

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.020 align:middle line:84%
articulate it
loudly and clearly.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, always remember
that you can be beneficial

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
for the overall evolution of
the universe and for the shift

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
that we are experiencing
in this reality and beyond,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:84%
by just projecting it
from your heart outside

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:90%
into the universe.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you want,
and I really want

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to go with what the community
said in the comments, just

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
say something like,
all shift happily now.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
This is my personal
message as someone

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:84%
who went through fear a
long time ago and also

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
my dedication to the process
and shifting of the universe.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And I invite everyone to
join in as I join everyone.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you, Tim.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.942 align:middle line:90%
It was a great show.

00:27:04.942 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure and honor.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The First Order is the
original name that the Greys

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:90%
gave themselves.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Their mission's to
bring everyone together

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and to structure
all the species.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a police
force inside the order?

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody is controlling the
First Order than the First

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Order.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And we have warrior-type
species that are

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:90%
combined under this alliance.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:90%
