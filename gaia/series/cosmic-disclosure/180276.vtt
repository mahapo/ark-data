00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Today we
have a special guest.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:10%
His name is Jason
Rice, and he claims

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:10%
to have been in the
Secret Space Program.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:10%
His story is incredible,
and I'm sure you

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
will find it compelling.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON RICE: Hello, Jay.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.056 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, it's great to
have you, because your story is

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:90%
absolutely fascinating.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
You went to university at
the auspices of the Army.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I went to Florida
Institute of Technology

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
under a four-year
engineering scholarship.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was awarded a medical
scholarship for the Air Force

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:90%
ROTC.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was awarded an engineering
scholarship for the US Army.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.854 align:middle line:90%
And I chose the engineering.

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
commissioned the same day

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I graduated with a Bachelor of
Science in civil engineering.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, at the
end of my education,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I had applied to go on
and get a master's degree.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And they said, nope.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You're graduating in
December, and you're

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
starting your commission
and active duty immediately.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So two months after
you started your active duty,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
fully expecting just
a change in orders,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
going to be copacetic.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:90%
And then what happened?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I show
up at this facility

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and meet my new
company commander.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.085 align:middle line:84%
We got into the first
elevator, and there

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:90%
were two buttons-- up, down.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
He placed his hand on
a scanner on the wall,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.422 align:middle line:84%
and then we started
our trip down.

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It was about a
five-minute elevator ride.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And towards the bottom,
I recall that there

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
was a very peculiar
feeling of vertigo,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
where the world seemed to turn
sideways for just an instant,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and then it was gone.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.099 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And were there
cameras in this elevator?

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.264 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I'm sure there were.

00:01:57.264 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:90%
I never saw them.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
As they later told me
that from the moment

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I stepped foot in the facility
that I was being watched.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And all of my actions
and choices and decisions

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
were being recorded and used
for part of my training.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So we get to the end of the
bottom of that first elevator

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:90%
ride.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
He had his hand on his sidearm.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It was a Beretta.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And was very, very intently
watching what I was doing.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't
know about the--

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Oh, he was afraid
you might go psychotic?

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: He was worried
that if I went psychotic

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:90%
I would try and attack him.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And I later found
out that he had

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
had to use his sidearm
on another trainee

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:90%
earlier that day.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So we get to the end of
the elevator ride down,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and it opens up onto
a red-lit platform

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that's about 12 feet
high, 10 feet wide.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And 10 feet in front of
the elevators is a track,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and there's a capsule
transportation train,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's shaped like a pill.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It has a Lamborghini-style
door that's opened.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It was white.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
The capsule that we
were getting into

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
was barely shorter
than the landing.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So we get into the capsule, and
I sit down on the right side.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And he comes and sits
down in front of me.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And our knees are only
a few inches apart.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And the door closes.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't tell which
direction we were moving in.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I sat quietly,
and I got the feeling

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that we were moving in a
direction towards my back.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:90%
So I was facing rear.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that trip, it
lasted about 30 minutes.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.622 align:middle line:84%
We passed through a portal,
and we're no longer on Earth.

00:03:57.622 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The train passed
through a portal?

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.038 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The train
passed through a portal

00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
and took us to another location.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I was able to recognize that
because the background Schumann

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
resonance was different.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the same as here.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able
to pick that up.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.047 align:middle line:84%
And that actually came
out during hypnosis.

00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: OK, hang on here.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.849 align:middle line:84%
First off, what's a
Schumann resonance?

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: OK.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
The Schumann resonance
is a background frequency

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:90%
that is present on Earth.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you felt a shift
in that background frequency

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:84%
when you went
through the portal?

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I felt it, yes.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:90%
After I went through the portal.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.371 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What was it like
going through the portal?

00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Was there any physical feelings?

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Mental feelings?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was so focused on
that vertigo, the world going

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
sideways in the elevator, that I
was still overwhelmed with, OK,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The newness.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The newness.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:90%
This is all different.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen any of
these things before.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't notice a
difference at that time.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:90%
It was a minor difference.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't have been that
much, going from the background

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:84%
frequency here to wherever
it was that we went to.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't have been
a shift of that much.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And they supplemented it with an
artificial background frequency

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Which-- subtly different,
but different nonetheless.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Describe
what a portal is.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Portal technology
is used for travel,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and it can take a
shape of as large

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
as they need it to get
a vehicle or a person.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's to instantaneously
move from one place to another.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It could be within
a solar system,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
or it could be somewhere
else in the galaxy.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So for all I know, I could have
been 1,500 light years away.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Or it could have been a
mined-out asteroid that's

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:90%
within our own solar system.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I suspect it was Mars.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What happened then?

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, a
30-minute capsule ride.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We pull up into what turned
out to be the next landing,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:90%
our stopping point.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't feel the train
stopping, the capsule stopping.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.407 align:middle line:84%
So the only indication I
had that we had arrived

00:06:12.407 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:84%
was the door started opening,
and it scared the shit out

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.615 align:middle line:84%
of me because I thought
we were still moving.

00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And I expected to see it
get ripped off any moment.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And the captain that
was with me knew it.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And so he knew that we
were going to be stopping,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and he was watching to
see what my reaction was.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And so he saw me freak
out for a moment,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
because I thought we were about
to witness the capsule coming

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:90%
apart.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:90%
And he smirked.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And I knew right then that,
OK, this is another one

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:90%
of those new guy tricks.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:90%
All right, I get it.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And so we get out.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're in this
new landing that

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
was about 100 feet long,
about 30 feet high.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:90%
It was all white lit.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:90%
It was no longer red lighting.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And so there were a bank
of three elevator doors--

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
two standard-sized
elevator doors, and then

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
the largest set
of elevator doors

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen in my life.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.494 align:middle line:84%
These things were big enough
to drive a semi truck into.

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:13.293 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were enormous.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So we would walk up to one of
the man-sized elevator doors,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and he hits the button.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:90%
The doors open.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I look from him
into the elevator.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And no more than four
feet in front of me

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:90%
is an alien staring at me.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:90%
In the elevator?

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: In the elevator.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:90%
About four feet tall.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Large, dark eyes.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Small mouth.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Small nose.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And how did you react?

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I turned and
looked at the captain,

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:90%
who was on my right.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And then pointed
at the elevator.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there's
something in the elevator.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what is it?

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I looked back at the
elevator, and it was gone.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't about
to tell him what

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen, because at this point
I was still clueless on what

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Were you scared?

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I was surprised.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Thinking back on it, it
wasn't a fear so much as,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
what's he doing here, not
what in the world is that.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So the captain didn't
give any indication

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:90%
that there was anything strange.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I-- following
his lead and not about

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
to tell him, my first commanding
officer, that I had just

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:84%
seen an alien in the
elevator, I chalked it up

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.192 align:middle line:84%
to another one of
those new guy tricks.

00:08:43.192 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So, Jason,
one of the things

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that we did besides
giving you a polygraph is

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
we had Georgina Cannon, who is
a noted hypnotherapist, come

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and hypnotize you for almost
three hours, actually.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I guess that was
the point, actually,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of doing these
sessions, was that we

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
were hoping that it would
release more memories

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:07.699 align:middle line:84%
and kind of create a cognition
for you after the sessions.

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And that happened, right?

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mhm, it has happened.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:90%
It has been helpful.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's listen to a section
of that regression section.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGINA CANNON: And
tell me what happened.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.466 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Well, we got in
the elevator and rode up.

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:29.825 align:middle line:84%
And when we came to a stop, we
were inside a giant colosseum.

00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So tell me about
the briefing that you all had.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They took us all
in into the auditorium.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Schuller came up first.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And he talked to
us, thanking us.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:90%
He thanked us for volunteering.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:90%
If we'd only known.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.006 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So what did
Colonel Schuller do?

00:10:16.006 --> 00:10:18.894 align:middle line:84%
He thanked you for
volunteering, and then what?

00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: More bullshit.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Like we had a choice.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
They told us we were
the tip of the spear,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and we'd have the
best equipment,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and that we were going
to help other planets.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Other people.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you got hypnotized.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Well it was--

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
it was very helpful
in that there

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
were things that came
out during the hypnosis

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:90%
that I hadn't recalled yet.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And so there are a number
of points and pieces

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
of the puzzle that I'm
very, very thankful for.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
During the hypnosis, I
recall having images of doors

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:90%
opening and closing.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I have
had more memories return.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I do know that, again,
part of the going

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
away presents that were left
with me included shutting off

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:84%
memories and shutting off
things, as well as routines,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that continually
work on removing memory

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:90%
from the events.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So there were things that
came out during the hypnosis

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that I've been able
to recall some of.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
But after the
hypnosis, I couldn't

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
remember some of the specific
details, again, because

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
of the memory routines that they
left me with to wipe those out.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's a continuous battle
that I have to fight regularly,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
on the remembering
side of things.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, I want to get
into this in more detail.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.027 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
by memory routines?

00:11:56.027 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Are you talking about
screen memories?

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I'm talking about
the routines that they have

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
think of it as like the mental
eraser that they have that's

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:84%
running in the background
that is continually

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to remove the memories
from the conscious mind.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So that, again, you
don't talk about things

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.791 align:middle line:90%
that you're not supposed to.

00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it's almost like a
loop that they put you through.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.789 align:middle line:84%
So when you think
a certain thought,

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
this loop comes in and causes
it to just kind of become

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:84%
a maddening thing
inside your head.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't want
to think about it anymore.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, well,
it's almost like putting

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:84%
a frosted glass in
front of a window,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
is that you wipe
away the moisture,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:90%
and you can see for a moment.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the
condensation comes back.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have to work
at continuing to wipe

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:90%
the window off to remember it.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's a great
analogy, actually.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So you'd recommend
other people that

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
have been in the Secret Space
Program to actually go and do

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:90%
this also?

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I would.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:90%
I would highly recommend it.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.196 align:middle line:84%
When I first started waking
up, my first response

00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
was, gosh, I'd like to have
all these memories back

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:84%
When I had certain
memories come back

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I realized the folly in that.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And that, for my own
sanity, my higher self

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:84%
has decided what and when
and the timing of it.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And so trust in that, as well
as getting help with those,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
either through hypnotic
regression or through therapy.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of ways
that you can help yourself

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:90%
to recall those memories.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All right, so this train
has taken you into this room.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
You see this alien
in the elevator.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
The captain doesn't
act like he sees it.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Alien disappears.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We enter
in the elevator.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
The captain accompanies me and
gives me a very knowing look.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:90%
And he hit the up button.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Doors close, and we
rode the elevator up.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a very long ride.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.635 align:middle line:84%
I suspect it was probably
four or five floors up,

00:14:00.635 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:90%
is where we went to.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
This time, when the
elevator doors opened,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:84%
it was still a natural
rock formation,

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
except it was the size
of an NFL stadium.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This area--
is this in a cave?

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, it was all
in a natural rock cave.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
All of the stops once
we had gone underground

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:90%
were in natural cave structures.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:90%
This was no exception.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
When we entered
that last elevator

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and went up to the
training grounds,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
it opened up into the largest
underground cave structure

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I'd ever seen in my life.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen any pictures
that are equal to it.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How was it lit?

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That was one of the
really interesting parts of it,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the walls and ceiling,
they all seemed to be lit--

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:90%
well lit.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Bright as daylight.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
But I could not find any
origin of the lights.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if the walls
themselves were lit in a way

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't localize where
the lights were coming from.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But there was no disputing
that the whole area was lit.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.495 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was really kind of a
color or hue to the lighting?

00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It looked very daylight.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Very much like daylight.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what was going
on in this gigantic cavern?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, it was
empty at the time.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I was gawking like coming to
the city for the first time.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the captain
started walking as soon

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:90%
as the doors opened.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
across that it was

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.490 align:middle line:84%
a track with the vibration
absorptive material on it.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
They had--

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The what?

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Vibration
absorptive material.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like foam, rubbery,
around the track.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
You usually find it
on indoor tracks.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.530 align:middle line:84%
The inner field on the track
itself was clearly AstroTurf.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:90%
It looked like grass.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:84%
The outer areas had some
training seats, tables, chairs.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Something that anybody
in the military

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:90%
recognized as a class area.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
They had what looked to
be a volleyball sandpit.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Except it didn't have
any posts or nets.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
They had a shooting
range on one side.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Elevated above the ground
were these networks

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:90%
in series of catwalks.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Some of them had rails.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were missing rails.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:84%
There were ropes hanging
down from the ceiling

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.640 align:middle line:84%
with a single carabiner on the
end, which are the little latch

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
devices that's commonly used
in mountain climbing and rock

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.017 align:middle line:90%
climbing.

00:16:37.017 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So this is a
training facility.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's
exactly what it was.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And for soldiers.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: For soldiers.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Except, for the life of
me, I couldn't figure out

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
why they needed a trapeze-type
training facility for soldiers.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Later I found out why.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Why?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, it
has to do with--

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
the hang glider
part of the training

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:84%
involves using a neurally
operated gravity pack.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Utilizing the grav packs so
that we could create thrust

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
so that we could gain
altitude, lose altitude.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:84%
That ended up being
the training grounds

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
for where we were learned
about small unit tactics,

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
avoiding each other, not hitting
each other, firing from it.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were using hang
glider devices to fly around?

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the packs were
battery powered.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Which meant that they had
a very limited duration.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
If you burned a full
burn without stopping,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
they would only last for
probably 30, 45 minutes.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.315 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
much of a long life.

00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what you did was
you used them in concert

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:90%
with the glider.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.559 align:middle line:84%
And so you weren't hovering,
but you were flying.

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Sometimes you're
using the electric,

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:90%
sometimes you're not.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Sometimes you're
using the electric,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes you're not.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
We generally used
them to gain altitude

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or to counter for
firing our weapons.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So you had to learn how
to use it mentally first.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Help turn left, help
turn right, up, down.

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All being
neurologically driven.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.094 align:middle line:90%
Through a helmet or something?

00:18:12.094 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yep, through
our combat helmets.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So, using the
weapons that we used,

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
we had to counter it
with the grav packs.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The hang gliders were
not the ideal platform

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%
to be staging an attack.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I was going to say, yeah.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were more intended
for dropping in, relocating,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
or for getting in
using stealth methods,

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:90%
because it's ultra quiet.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So then, you're in this
big, huge facility.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Clearly you know that you're
going to be part of something

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Then what happened--
they haven't told you yet

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that you're even in the
Secret Space Program.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:84%
This guy hasn't even talked
to you at all, the Captain?

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Nope, hasn't
said anything--

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:90%
to hold all questions.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So what happened next?

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was, at the
time, what I thought was a very

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
strange-looking container--
shipping container--

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:90%
with odd-looking doors.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
There was also a movie
screen-sized surface

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.360 align:middle line:84%
that had blackened,
charred marks and partially

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:90%
burned areas on it.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of those were on
the mobile cable system

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:84%
so that they could relocate them
any place in the stadium area.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
The flat screen didn't
mean anything to me yet,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:84%
but that was one of the targets
we used with our plasma rifles.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a specially
treated surface

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
so that we could live fire our
plasma rifles without starting

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:90%
a massive conflagration.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What's a plasma rifle?

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It shoots out
a ball of hot plasma,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
as hot as the sun,
that will travel

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:56.595 align:middle line:84%
at unbelievable rates of fire,
and does incredible damage.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it didn't
know what any of that stuff

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
was used for.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm just walking through and
amazed that it's even there.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It smelled like moldy,
misty, musty campfire.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.261 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: The whole cavern?

00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:10.468 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The whole area, yeah.

00:20:10.468 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Very musty?

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Is there water dripping?

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, no water dripping.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:84%
They sealed off the interior
surface of all the walls.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:90%
So there was no water.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.449 align:middle line:84%
Any water that came in
would have been a leak,

00:20:22.449 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
found it quickly.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.614 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Outside of
the door you came in,

00:20:25.614 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:90%
were there any other doors?

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were doors in
other areas of the training

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:90%
colosseum.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that we
headed directly for

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:84%
were directly across from
where the elevators opened up.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever discover
what this weird container

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:90%
thing is?

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I sure did.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What is it?

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It is for simulating the
exit from one of the shuttles.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to move
it around at elevation

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
basically jump out from it.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, because you're dealing
with people that have not

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
done this before
that are learning how

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to use the neural interface,
as well as flying,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as shooting, as well as
aiming and trying to hit what

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:90%
you're trying to hit.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
There were a number
of close calls

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
where people were almost
hit, or there were a couple

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:90%
of rounds put through gliders.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, you're trying to
coordinate all of these things

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:90%
So that was very--

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.797 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is it safe to say this is
the beginning of your training?

00:21:22.797 --> 00:21:24.713 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This was the
beginning of my training.

00:21:24.713 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did anybody
die in this training?

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.005 align:middle line:90%
There were deaths.

00:21:29.005 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sounds very dangerous.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So what happened after
you saw the cavern?

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go next?

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We went through
a door on the other side,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
which entered into a hallway.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Traveled to the
end of that hallway

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and entered into
another hallway.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that
door was a stairwell.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And the captain started
going downstairs.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And I snuck a peek to
look up through the center

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
of the stairwell to see, OK,
how high does this thing go?

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't see the top.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So it had to have gone at least
to the top of the training

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:90%
stadium.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so, when we
came into the next hallway,

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
he made an immediate right
turn into the first door.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And turns out that that
was the conference room

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that we would be spending
the next couple of hours

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:84%
going over paperwork, paperwork,
signing for this equipment,

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:90%
signing for that equipment.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Still no briefing.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So I walked in, and he
told me to have a seat.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:90%
And I sat down next to him.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And in front of me were a
stack of papers in a folder.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:10%
Inside this room was a
black stripe around the top.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:90%
12 inches.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
It was only about 3/4 of an
inch wide but about 12 inches

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:90%
from the ceiling.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And it went all the way
around the entire room.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:84%
At one end of the room was
a large flat screen TV.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:90%
It looked to be about 60 inches.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what's this
black stripe doing?

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The black stripe around
the upper portion of the room

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be full
monitoring equipment,

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
which included bio
signs, video, audio,

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
anything and everything that
they needed to determine--

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
infrared.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Who's in the room, whether
they're sweating a lot,

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
or they're cool, they're
calm, they're collected.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't realize
it at the time.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It just looked like
a black stripe.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you signed
all these documents.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Signed
all the documents.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Spent two hours signing.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Is anybody telling you?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:84%
You're getting debriefed
on any of this?

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: He said,
hold all questions.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, we've got
a lot of work to do

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%
in a short amount of time.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
You'll get a full briefing
day after tomorrow,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:90%
after everybody is here.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.880 align:middle line:84%
You'll get it the same
time everybody else does.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is
that they plan it

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that way to keep you guessing so
you don't know what's going on,

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
so that they can gauge
and judge and evaluate

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
your reactions to unknown,
stressful situations.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Sitting in front of
the captain as well

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:90%
was a blank slating device.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time I'd ever
seen one, that I could recall.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What does that look like?

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The one that I'd seen
resembled a jeweler's hammer,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:90%
which is a small hammer.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Except instead of
having a hammer head,

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
it had a small, conical and
crystal fixture on the end.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And a plain black
handle, no markings.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:90%
A single button on it.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know what it was
about, and I had no idea.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Found out if I had declined
the offer, that that was what

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
my fate was going to be,
to be mind wiped and blank

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
slated, and sent
back to Fort Wood.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You know, a lot of people
are going to be watching this.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
think that you're crazy.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Or they're going to
think you're a liar.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And you don't come off
crazy, I have to tell you.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But the lying part,
we can't tell.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we had you do
was take a polygraph test

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.121 align:middle line:90%
from a polygraph examiner.

00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And we want to show you the
results of that right now.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:21.474 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.474 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:10%
>>BRIAN HOFF: Jason,
go ahead and relax.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:10%
Remain still.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.373 align:middle line:90%
The test will begin in a moment.

00:25:25.373 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.626 align:middle line:10%
The test is beginning.

00:25:34.626 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Are you now in the
state of Colorado?

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Regarding your
extraterrestrial experiences,

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
do you intend to answer my
questions truthfully today?

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.247 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.247 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Have you ever
said anything in anger

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:90%
that you later regretted?

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Were you ever a member
of a Secret Space Program?

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.772 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.772 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Did you ever
engage in military service

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Mars?

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.652 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.652 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Have you ever told
a lie to keep yourself out

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:90%
of trouble?

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Were you ever a member
of a Secret Space Program?

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.152 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.152 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Did you ever
engage in military service

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.620 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Mars?

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.682 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.682 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Have you ever told
a lie to keep yourself out

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:10%
of trouble?

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.654 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.654 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: During your
entire life, have you ever

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:90%
broken even one law?

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Have you ever killed
an extraterrestrial being?

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.252 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.252 --> 00:26:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Have you
ever been captured

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
by an extraterrestrial being?

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.079 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: During your
entire life, have

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:84%
you ever violated any
rules or regulations?

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.222 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.222 --> 00:27:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Have you
ever been captured

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:90%
by an extraterrestrial being?

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.679 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: During your
entire life, have

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
you ever violated any
rules or regulations?

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.429 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: OK, the test is ending.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Please remain still.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.134 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:10%
What you're looking
on the test is

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:10%
changes in breathing patterns
or upper body movements

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:10%
and activity.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Down here a little
bit more, you're

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.539 align:middle line:84%
looking for GSR changes,
or Galvanic Skin Responses.

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it's
opening and closing

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of sweat glands
in our fingertips.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Just below that, what I'm
looking for is changes in blood

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.870 align:middle line:90%
pressure, heart rate, et cetera.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Below that on the screen,
what I'm looking at

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:84%
is PPG readings, which is
Photoplethysmograph readings.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, what that is
is the opening and closing

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.350 align:middle line:84%
or the constriction of blood
vessels in your fingertips.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other readings
I have on there are whether

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:84%
or not he moved or was trying
to cheat the test in any way,

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:90%
and he wasn't.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm looking
at on the screen

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
right now is that, for the
directed lies that I asked him

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to tell, which were, you know,
have you ever broken any laws,

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:84%
stuff like that, he does have
a physiological response that

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
comes from that that is
indicative of somebody

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
normally lying to us and
that physiological result

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:90%
that I've come to expect.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:84%
When we see the other
questions where he answers yes

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
to being part of a
Secret Space Program,

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:84%
or being on the
planet Mars, there's

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:84%
not that typical
physiological arousal

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that we would expect
to see when somebody

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:90%
knows that they're lying.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Again, any time that there is
an extraordinary story that

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
is so far out of what is
normal and out of what I know

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.400 align:middle line:84%
as a human being and from
my experience, of course

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:84%
there's some doubt that
creeps into my mind.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, Jason seems
like a very credible source.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.650 align:middle line:90%
He's well spoken.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:90%
He came in here.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:84%
He seems to know exactly what he
feels happens when it happened.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
All the polygraph
can really tell

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
us is whether or not
somebody believes

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:90%
what they're saying is true.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Physiological
indicators indicate

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:84%
that he does not have
an arousal of any sort

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of biological
indicators that tell me

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:84%
that he disbelieves his
story even in the slightest.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So in that case,
what I'm saying is

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
that, ultimately,
Jason believes what

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:90%
he's telling us to be true.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the guy
conducting the polygraph

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:84%
kept asking you the
same questions over

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:90%
and over and over.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.356 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it was
driving you crazy.

00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think they were doing
that because they were trying

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to elicit different emotional
responses from you to see

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.377 align:middle line:84%
and guarantee that you were
being credible, I think.

00:30:01.377 --> 00:30:02.176 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, yes.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.560 align:middle line:84%
The direct lie stimulation
test, from what

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
it was explained to
me, was that they

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
try and create a
baseline for lying,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
as well as for
telling the truth.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the question about
have you ever broken a rule,

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.572 align:middle line:84%
that was a preconceived
lie that was--

00:30:20.572 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.071 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: --so that
every time you lied,

00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:90%
you would see your response.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.076 align:middle line:84%
So that could be matched against
the other responses, where

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:29.200 align:middle line:90%
you were telling the truth.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.158 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:30:30.158 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So how did you feel being asked
these questions over and over

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and over?

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was anxiety
provoking because when

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I start talking
about my experiences,

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.450 align:middle line:84%
it would induce anxiety
or other physiological

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:84%
effects to try and distract
me from talking about it.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
the program that they

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:84%
use for people that
are getting out,

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.510 align:middle line:84%
is they don't want
you to talk about it.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So they put programs
into your psyche

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:84%
so that you either
have an anxiety attack,

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:84%
or you start sweating, or the
room gets too small no matter

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:90%
how big it is.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.510 align:middle line:90%
You can't focus.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:15.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't stay attentive to what
you're trying to talk about.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
When I first started waking
up and remembering the things

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that I had done, it
was really difficult

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:84%
because of those
programs, those presents

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:90%
that they left with me.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, clearly,
you are not lying.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.630 align:middle line:84%
At least you believe
what you're saying.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I've known that
what I'm saying is true.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Even as shortly as
a few years ago,

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:84%
if you'd asked me
that whether or not

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I believed I was a part of
some Secret Space Program

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy, I would have
said, no, sounds interesting,

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.070 align:middle line:90%
but that's not me.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:53.990 align:middle line:84%
However, participating in
it, having the memory recall

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that I have of the experiences
and the events that I have,

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:84%
those things that
have happened to me,

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.560 align:middle line:84%
the experiences that
I've remembered,

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.570 align:middle line:84%
have proven to me
without any doubt at all

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that I was a part
of that program.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.860 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:10%
and Secret Space Programs.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a real, conscious
being that has just passed

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.435 align:middle line:90%
within maybe a few hours.

00:32:29.435 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Or was killed.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was a
kinetic energy weapon.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
They will take any
large enough size rock,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and then launch it towards
the surface and the areas

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
try and strike.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of relics that have
been collected around the world

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.810 align:middle line:84%
since ancient times have been
stored below the Vatican.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.725 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this stuff
is extraterrestrial.

00:32:48.725 --> 00:32:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> They believe that they come
from this extraterrestrial

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:84%
lineage, when we're
just basically animals.
