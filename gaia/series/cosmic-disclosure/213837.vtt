>> EMERY SMITH: Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we're with Tim,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:10%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you
again for having me.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, Tim, from all
the years of direct contact

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
experiences with a variety of
species within special access

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
programs, what is your most
personally meaningful experience

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:90%
of all?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
speak about the most

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:90%
personal of my experiences.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite nervous of bringing
that out into the public,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%
but here we are.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So well, basically, it was
one of those days where

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I came into those facilities and
I've been informed we were still

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
doing the contact
work with the Greys,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and I've been informed
that they wanted

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:90%
to do something special today.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just nodded
because that's usually

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
the thing you do when
your superior informs you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
about something,
which I didn't know

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
was the acceptance to what's
going to happen on a soul

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:90%
level or something.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they actually
performed a consciousness

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
download on me so
that I actually,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:84%
with my own consciousness,
went into their level six

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:90%
consciousness Grey being.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did
all this happen?

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, tell us
the entire process

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
of entering level
six consciousness.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So basically, I entered
the typical container situation

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked
about many, many times.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:10%
I've actually met two
of those Grey figures.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:10%
And from that moment on, I only
remember that, well, reality

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:10%
changed in some kind of way.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So I felt myself
disintegrated from the reality

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have here
on this planet.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There was some kind of blurry
in-between phase that I cannot

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:90%
really make sense of.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
I felt integrated

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
into the consciousness sphere of
this gigantic Grey intelligence

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:90%
at level six consciousness.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, expand a
little bit more on that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean exactly?

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It means exactly that
your own consciousness gets

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
introduced to a
different reality.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So what you suddenly felt was
that the whole existence of me

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:90%
being Tim was not real anymore.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So it was just some kind
of artificial simulation

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of way.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
felt that I merged

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
with this gigantic super
consciousness of the Greys.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was frustrating
and depressive

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and very, very, very, very
isolated in that context.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why was it depressive
when you were having this

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:90%
mind-blowing opportunity?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I don't want to go into
many details because there is

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:84%
something that's
called cold trauma,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
which would be like forwarding
this experience in that kind

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:90%
of sense.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But I think, well,
I suddenly realized

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that the universe in
itself is actually alone.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And it felt super, super
alone in that moment,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and that anything
that we are creating

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
is actually just some
kind of artificial show

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're just convincing
ourselves to be part of,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and that this has no
substantial value at all.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
And this must have been the
intelligence of level six

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
consciousness of the Greys,
which actually came to this,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
which I called a dead
end mode at some point,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
where they have taken control
over their whole existence

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
so much that it doesn't make
any difference anymore if you

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:90%
experience it or if you don't.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like you realize that
nothing in the universe

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:90%
actually has any value.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: On this earthly plane,
is that 3D reality projection

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
when you were in this higher
realm of consciousness?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, I
think that's the sad,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
sad consciousness that this
Grey consciousness conveys.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like you've been inside
of a video game or something,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you shut down
the PC and suddenly

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
your whole experience
and your whole existence

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
has no value anymore.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was actually
this deep sense

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
of feeling isolated and being
restless in spacelessness

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and timelessness.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were you experiencing
being six in relation

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to the Greys or collective
of all consciousness?

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So what I was
experiencing actually was

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
the level six
consciousness of the Greys.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the Grey line
could access different lines

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, which range
from level three consciousness

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
to level six consciousness.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And their level six
consciousness at that moment

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
was super devastated because
through all their experiences,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
through all their superiority,
they came to this moment

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.510 align:middle line:84%
where they were so
superior that even

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
reality bent in front of them
and it had no value anymore.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
playing this video game

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and someone has given you all
the cheat codes in that manner,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you
feel like you're only

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
playing a chess game isolated
with yourself through eternity.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And any relationship that you
have has no value anymore.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And that brought me into a very
depressed mood for, I think,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
three years or
something until we

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.340 align:middle line:90%
started to work with being six.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And being six actually,
well, in this case,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:84%
they friendly approached
me and asked me

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
if I was willing to look into
their version of their level six

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
whole new dimension.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So I went there through a
consciousness experience

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
into a level six
consciousness two times.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But this time, you
came to the realization

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, everything
is some kind of creation

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:90%
but it's beautiful.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge wonder and it's
beautiful to have the chance

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
to be in relationship with
all these aspects of yourself

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and to wondrously exchange all
this experience and this love

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:84%
with each other, and
to go through this,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and have all this huge variety
of colors and aspects and beauty

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that you can create and
play with for all times.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
There's no ground to
where you fall down to.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just you're floating
in creativity forever.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, Tim, the contrast
from human perspective to that

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of a level six, was that too
much to handle that time?

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I'm pretty convinced
that the Greys want to translate

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to me their perspective, their
failed perspective in some way

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:90%
on reality and life.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they participate

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
with me and with other beings in
order to find a reason for life,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:90%
if you may say it that way.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So basically, a lot of the
projects and the communication

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that we then had was about
finding your inner sparkle

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's the
reason for existence?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Why should you even
care about being alive?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that
the Greys are actually

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
quite interested in solving
puzzles, for example.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So even when the whole universe
is actually one life form,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:84%
it offers an almost
infinite number

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:84%
of puzzles and situations
and exciting ways

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.170 align:middle line:90%
to solve and puzzle around.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:10%
And this seemed to
be something that

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:10%
was more or less the spark
to the motivation for life

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:10%
for the Greys.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, from your
first experience in level six

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to the time you experienced
it a few years later,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:90%
what was the difference?

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Oh, the perspective
totally changed.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically the same.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
You could either
see the universe

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.040 align:middle line:84%
as being an isolated
life form that

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
only has itself and everything
that it creates is just

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.860 align:middle line:90%
like a useless, meaningless--

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, temporary
play or something.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But you could also say that
the universe is itself.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And so millions and
billions and trillions

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
of aspects and
varieties, and that

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:84%
there will always,
for eternity, there

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
will be something to explore
that we can create together,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that we can go together, that we
are on this mission all together

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that gives us meaning,
that our life has meaning,

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that creation
itself has meaning,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and that this is the
most beautiful thing that

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
could have ever happen to us.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite convinced that the
Greys would have loved and want

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
to come from the one perspective
to the other perspective,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and that their reason
for communicating

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
with me and the reason for
everything that's taking place

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
right now is for us all to shift
to this happy place of being

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:90%
six.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this like what
the Hindus call samadhi, Tim,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
or a universal
oneness experience?

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there is a
connection between the Greys,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
being six, and
Eastern philosophy?

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah, totally.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's just that.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So basically, something that
being six told, said to me

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
was that without us, the
creator would be alone.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But with us, he has more ways to
have joy, experience joy and fun

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:84%
than he could ever think of
himself or herself or itself.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we are in this
existence, in this play.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's for us to give
joy to our highest being

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:90%
and to receive that joy back.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And that will create this ever
ongoing multiplicity of beauty

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of way.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this immersion into
level six consciousness where

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
you get your profound
knowledge about the Greys,

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
or is it from
face-to-face encounters?

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I think
it's both, actually.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think that all the
data that I've received

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
comes from direct contact
and direct communication

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.830 align:middle line:90%
in that field.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think the emotional side
and the significance of it

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and being invested in
that kind of scenario,

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.383 align:middle line:84%
this comes from the direct
experience for sure.

00:12:22.383 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, is this what
you call the master line

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Greys?

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah, very well.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely correct.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the master
line of the Greys

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that had failed because
it came to the conclusion

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that it had no reason
anymore for existence.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
it became isolated

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:90%
and didn't move anymore.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the universe
came mostly to a stop

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was also so rejective
towards new information.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the Greys
came, this master line

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
came to a full control
version of itself,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
which means that it needs
to refuse any other control

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of any other beings.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So from that perspective,
they were alone.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody, there
was none, nothing else

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:84%
than this one creative
main core, if you want,

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:84%
this consciousness core
that is just entertaining

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:90%
itself with ideas.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, even
that didn't matter anymore,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and then it just
fell into deep sleep.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And now we have this new
version of the reality, which

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:84%
is where humans play a
role and we're all back

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
to this level
three consciousness

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a better
version of level six

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually the
answer to your question,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
why level three consciousness
or humans in their minor form

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:90%
play a role to advanced beings?

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they just get
back into the experience

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and roll it out new and
come to a better conclusion.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, why do you think
you were specifically chosen

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
by the level six master line
of the Greys for this profound

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I have no
idea, actually.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I feel quite normal, actually.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that I bring
some communicative skills

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:90%
to the table.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that I'm
creative in myself

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:90%
and I'm interested in creation.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm also empathic
in some kind of way,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and I basically
nodded when I was

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:84%
asked if I want to experience
something profound,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and little did I know
what's going to happen.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't know
if I would have

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
agreed if I would have known
the full potential of what's

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But then again, the
level six consciousness

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
of being six and the
other perspective,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
too, it brings so much more
joy and so much more such

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:84%
an enhanced and enriched
perspective on life

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that it's just
beautiful and wonderful

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.063 align:middle line:90%
to have experienced that.

00:15:07.063 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, did you
personally get something from

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:84%
that experience beyond
your own enrichment?

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I would also say that
in direct comparison that I can

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:90%
recall a lot of data.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, like I'm constantly
calculating timelines

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, which seems
to be something that

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:90%
comes from this experience.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What does calculating
a timeline in your mind entail?

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, it means that
level six consciousness is

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
actually a consciousness, an
awareness outside of time.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So once you've had this
kind of experience,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:84%
then you sort of
gain an understanding

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:90%
of how temporal dynamics work.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I've also been trained on that.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that I
can't stop doing, actually.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is some-- it's like
playing Sudoku in your mind

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.297 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of way.

00:15:58.297 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do you think the
level six master line of Greys

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:84%
has got from you
in that experience?

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:10%
>> TIM: Pretty clearly, they
got from me that I was able

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:10%
to connect being six
to the Greys through me

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:10%
as an intermediate, which
means that this master line

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:10%
of the Greys was so extremely
isolated and was not accepting

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:10%
any other truth because
there they were so solid

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:10%
in their reality perspective,
if that makes sense.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
They would never ever
accept the perspective

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of being six as
possible anymore.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So they needed myself who went
through this other experience

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
in order to say it's an opposing
experience, but it's there.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:90%
You can choose, basically.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's just
like having a friend who's

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:84%
showing in a different direction
and different perspective,

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and then your
whole life changed.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Some people might
suggest that this complete

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
integration of your individual
sense of Tim with the master

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
line of the Greys would make
you an awakened Grey being.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to that?

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I don't know
because, I mean,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.539 align:middle line:84%
I've been to the level six
consciousness of being six

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And being six is composed of so
many beautiful other species,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:84%
collectives,
individuals, et cetera,

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that I don't feel
attached to any species

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
at all, if I come to
this conclusion actually.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that it's
your personal choice

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of way.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So many people are wondering
what kind of starseed they are

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
or what their
perspective and role is.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And the only answer
I can give to that

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a book
that wants to be

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:90%
written in that kind of way.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you calculate the
timelines correctly and/or do

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
what your heart wants and where
you feel your heart presence,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:90%
it's beautiful.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:90%
You're writing your own story.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.118 align:middle line:90%
And that's wonderful.

00:18:16.118 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you describe the
difference between a level six

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:90%
consciousness and a being six?

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah, for sure.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So level six
consciousness is a model

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring structure
to consciousness awareness,

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to bring a structure to that.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So being six is a life form that
exists in a realm of level six

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
it's the only one.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
By far, it's not.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.580 align:middle line:84%
There are many,
many other beings.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:84%
The Greys itself
have a "being six,"

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that way.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
They all have different
ultimate beings that

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:90%
are at level six consciousness.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you, for example, take
the concept of your higher

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
being, there's the
spiritual concept

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that everyone has this
higher being, which

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:90%
is actually a soul level.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So any one of us is operating
on level six consciousness

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:90%
on the soul level.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
People usually feel
separated from that.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:84%
They don't have this
direct experience.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you have a three--
level three consciousness,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
you always have a
level six consciousness

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:90%
on your soul level as well.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is that where the soul
resides when the body container

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:90%
is no longer in existence?

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: 100%, yes.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It's what is called the
realm of non-existence.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
You could also call
it death if you want.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But through this
malevolent installation

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have on this
planet, the people

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
associate something
very specific with death

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
they have been taught

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and through their
own creative forces.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:84%
If they don't decide
for something else

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
to be relevant in there,
they will replicate

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:90%
that in some kind of way.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that this realm
exists and it can be beautiful.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, Tim, wouldn't
it be more accurate to say

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:84%
it's the realm of the
unformed existence rather than

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:90%
the non-existence?

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: 100%.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:90%
It's formless form or--

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.862 align:middle line:84%
yeah, formless form,
I think it's called.

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, having
experienced this profound union

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
with the master
line of the Greys,

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
what would you say is next
in terms of your mission?

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So basically, I'm
seeking for a level seven

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
consciousness just as
much as many other species

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and collectives or
individuals are,

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
which would be
the unified field.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So actually, remembering that
we are all creating creatively

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
this universe and
our experience,

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
well, would be super
attractive to me.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So that anyone else can
create their own home

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and that we have a multitude
of level six consciousness

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
so that we can, exchange and
journey from one to another.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically something
that I'm super interested in.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, did the Greys
task you for any specific

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:90%
mission here on Earth?

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, they asked
me specifically to connect

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
to the Trogdaborians,
which I did--

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:90%
which I denied.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm 100% convinced that they
knew what they were doing.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Bringing me to the awareness
of this master line

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and then having me find a
solution for that in some way,

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:90%
I think that was on purpose.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Because basically, it's
like bringing someone

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
into the realm of the
problem and then observing

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.150 align:middle line:90%
how he or she is solving it.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So my approach or
whatever my destiny was,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:84%
was to connect with
being six, which

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
was a suitable solution,
not only for me

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:90%
but for a multitude of beings.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how do you
integrate the unity you

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:84%
experienced into your
individual journey?

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And how do humans move
forward as a united species?

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, we're on a
perfect way, actually, I guess.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Because in the last
few years, there

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
have been so many changes
and so much more knowledge

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is being brought to
public attention.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
There will be a moment where
a bigger group of people

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
will become aware that they can
form and create the reality.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And through that, they will
create a collective field

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
where other beings that
are on the way to that

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:90%
can actually be hosted.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
once we've established

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that, when we have quite
a holistic society,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and from that moment on, it's
all about creation, exploration,

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and finding your
perfect home, actually.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So I would say we need to
overcome this level three

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:84%
experience and accept that
it's behind us already.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And say goodbye to it and
then go forward into existence

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and create whatever
comes from our heart.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Outside
from Greys and humans,

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.905 align:middle line:84%
who else holds the
unity sense of being?

00:23:30.905 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: It depends.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically like
what the Buddhists say,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that anything carries
the Buddha nature.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to Sarah Breksman
Cosme lately and she said to me,

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
so it's fascinating that
I can remember all that

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and I can recall all this
information and the experience

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say that anything
and everything is connected

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
to a certain realm of
level six consciousness,

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's being blocked
out in some kind of way

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:84%
as long as you want
it to be blocked out.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more profound
when you really experience

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:90%
that as your only reality.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And coming back from that
might have changed you

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of way.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So answering your question,
everything and anything,

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:84%
inanimate or alive or
non-alive, if that makes sense,

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.580 align:middle line:84%
has its own level
six experience,

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
but maybe some have
multiple of them

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and need to decide
for one to come true.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.015 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, whenever
they make that

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
an aware and
experienceable experience,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:90%
it totally changed everything.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.402 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As we
conclude this episode,

00:24:52.402 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:84%
what do you want to offer to
the viewers from your profound

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
experiences with the Greys
as we all move forward?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: If there's anything
I would say that we all need

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to come to a place of
home in the universe.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And then once we
found that and we

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
found this beautiful
inner space that we think

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
is worth living
and worth sharing,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
that you go out there and
share it with the community.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.793 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the approach
that I'm doing, actually.

00:25:20.793 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, Tim, there are
so many starseeds and beings

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, which ones
do you resonate with the most

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:90%
within your consciousness?

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: None, actually.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- I don't care.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:90%
I really don't care.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about the form
or the experience in general.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I think anyone can choose
their material form

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and whatever form they like,
but it should suit them.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And when they find their own
signature or their own design

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and they spark joy
into the universe

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and they entertain
the one creator

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and they invite
people to join them,

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the most
beautiful thing to do.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It seems to me that this
is the approach of the universe,

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that it wants us all to find
home and to find the sparkle

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:90%
of what keeps us alive.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, it
can be happy with us.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
ultimate experience.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, I want to
thank you so much for sharing

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:90%
your personal story with us.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
On behalf of our
audience here at Gaia,

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we are very grateful
for what you've offered.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Thank you so much.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm very grateful
to you and I'm super

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
happy that we have this
community of people

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:84%
coming together and
experiencing, and bringing

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:90%
being seven into life.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.870 align:middle line:84%
