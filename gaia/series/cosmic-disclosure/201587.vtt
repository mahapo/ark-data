00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.910 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we're with Dr.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:10%
Robert Wood.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:10%
He's a retired
aerospace engineer

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:10%
who has worked on everything
from the ballistic missile

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:10%
defense to the space station.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:10%
More recently, Bob is
the editor of a new book

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:10%
on William Tompkins called
"Selected By Extraterrestrials,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:10%

Top-Secret World of UFOs,

Nordic Secretaries."

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.222 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to the show.

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> ROBERT WOOD: Good morning.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, there's rituals
and symbols that have always

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
been associated with
the space missions.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.895 align:middle line:84%
And what did William
Tompkins say about this?

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, rituals and
symbols began when we started

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:05.069 align:middle line:84%
our first launches, because
every launch of each shuttle

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:90%
got its own name.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Endeavor, for
example, would be one.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And as time went on and we
had more and more launches,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
everybody was
looking for something

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to especially remember
that particular event with.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the Apollo
missions were--

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
actually, they were
numbered, but in addition, I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
believe each one had
another designation for it.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Now Bill didn't really
talk much that I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:90%
recall about the nomenclature.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But he was clearly involved
in the idea of rituals

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that his
father was a Mason.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was very aware of some
of the symbolism that goes along

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:90%
with the Masonic order.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And so he was comfortable,
I think, with the idea

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
that there would be special
names and rituals associated

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
with space launches.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now I do
recall the flag,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
the US flag was not the first
thing that came out of that

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.324 align:middle line:90%
lunar module.

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, the one thing
that's really a remarkable

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
event is that one of the first
jobs that Bill got when he went

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
to TRW was to watch the lunar
landing with Lance Armstrong

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
at an offsite location
that TRW had set up.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So here he was, looking
at a television monitor

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and seeing everything
and hearing everything

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:90%
live that was going on.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And he described to
me that what he saw

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
was Neil Armstrong emerging
from the spacecraft

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:84%
with a Masonic apron on
and a Masonic plaque.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
He went down, said something,
planted the plaque.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And then he went back up.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And then he came down
with the American flag.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And, of course--

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The camera
started rolling then.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: That's right.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.797 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: For the civilians.

00:02:54.797 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, yeah, yeah, the
camera for the public started

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:90%
rolling.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Rituals and symbols
have always been associated

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:90%
with these missions.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So why is it?

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important,
these rituals?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, the fact that
Neil Armstrong came down with

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the Masonic emblems is
a good example of that,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.180 align:middle line:84%
because it's clear the Masons
want to be able to claim that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
they were the first
ones to be on the moon.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.457 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Was Bill a Masonic?

00:03:21.457 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: No, but his father was.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: A mason?

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: And he realized after
his father died that he--

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
apparently they
found the ring that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
showed that he was
a 33rd degree Mason.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So that was very
impressive to him.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So he had grown up
knowing that there

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
was something called the
Masons, but he never was one.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.835 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Neil Armstrong,
was he a Mason?

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: Well, I presume he was.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I belong to a
couple of service clubs.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And once we had a person
speak to us who was a Mason.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.457 align:middle line:84%
And after the talk I went
up privately and asked him,

00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I said did you ever know
that Neil Armstrong came down

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
with a Masonic flag?

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me for a moment
and he said yeah, I knew that.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So did he leave just
the plaque on the lunar surface

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.805 align:middle line:90%
or-- and the flag?

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Bill never described
that level of detail.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
He did say he came down with
the plaque and the apron.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously he couldn't
have left it down on the moon

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:90%
because it didn't show it later.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think
those videos still exist?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.423 align:middle line:84%
Or are they locked up in
the Masonic Temple in DC?

00:04:25.423 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, it's not clear to
me that the Masons actually got

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:90%
the video.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that Bill saw
this video on the screen.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And because he was
a great artist,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
he was able to draw
a sketch of what

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
was on the crater, which was
six alien craft with reptilians

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:90%
standing underneath then.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:10%
So that's the other thing
that he saw at the same time,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:10%
right after or before.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't know whether
it was that he

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:10%
saw these alien craft
in association with Neil

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:10%
Armstrong stepping down.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Would you think
maybe this is some sort

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of declaration to
claim the moon?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Yes, I think
that's exactly it.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
However, what the Masons didn't
really know, in my judgment,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
was that the moon
was already occupied.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they would
appreciate not only playing

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
golf on the moon, but also
dropping garbage and also

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:90%
labeling it as mine.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: Right, right.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: To whatever
organization or nation--

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
well, we have-- let's look
at one of these videos

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:90%
with William Tompkins.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: OK.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:10%
>> WILLIAM TOMPKINS: If you take
me working in the secret think

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:10%
tank at Douglas, OK, only two
people that know that's even

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:10%
there at Douglas is the vice
president of engineering

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:10%
and Dr. Klemperer.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:10%
When we had meetings with navy
admirals there on the programs,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:10%
or when we had meetings
of other top officials,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:10%
or when we were doing design
review meetings of our own

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:10%
people-- because we had a
lot of people in that group--

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.303 align:middle line:10%
the subject would get to a
point where there was no answer.

00:06:12.303 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I would come
up with an answer.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The vice president
of engineering

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%
would always throw this in.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
He said Bill, you
approach everything,

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:84%
meaning this subject
and other stuff, as if--

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
you look at it as if you're
not from here at all.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I've had that stated
to me hundreds of times

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
by different people.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:10%
All I can say is my dad was
a 33 level Freemason, OK.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
My uncle Harding was chief
surgeon, Santa Monica Hospital.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of money, big
house, spent every cent

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that he had digging through
the insides of the pyramids,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
trying to decipher
the hieroglyphics.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's trying to do.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
He has three
daughters, my aunts.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
We lived in that house
for almost a year.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:90%
And what are we doing?

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:84%
There is a chair
that he has next

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:90%
to the fireplace in that house.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
The chair is almost
five feet wide,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
wood chair, all covered
with hieroglyphics.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And some people said that
it was King Tut's chair.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a good
thing to call it.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it came
from one of the kings.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how he smuggled
it out of the country,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
but he smuggled a whole lot
of stuff out of that country.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And he disseminated it
to top research people

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So once again, who
is Uncle Harding?

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:90%
A 33 level Freemason.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, and all I'm saying is
there's a whole lot of stuff

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:90%
that we don't--

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
we're not involved in,
we don't understand.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Interesting.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this big
chair, immediately I'm

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:90%
thinking giants, the Nephilim.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Someone larger than
a normal-sized human

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:90%
was utilizing this chair.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And what also surprises me is
that a 33 degree Mason who's

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
studying hieroglyphics
at this time

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.520 align:middle line:84%
should have already
known how to decipher

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those
hieroglyphics, because they

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:90%
have a huge library about that.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:90%
What year was that, you think?

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, the first book
that Bill wrote talked quite

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:84%
a bit about the relationships
his family and the fact that

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
they were involved in
and interested in Egypt,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:90%
everything about it.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's one photograph
in the first book that

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:10%
shows a couple of his
relatives with a UFO flying

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:10%
in the background, which is
kind of remarkable coincidence.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But he talks about how
when he was growing up

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
that his sisters
would run around

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
the house with togas, trying to
emulate what the Egyptians were

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
They were very Egyptian-oriented
during his adolescence.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Did he mention anything
about the pyramids to you?

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Oh, yeah, in
a couple of contexts,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
one in the context of his
father's and uncle's interest

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:84%
in them, but also in the context
of the fact that when he was

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
at TRW, that was
one of the tasks,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that they had a whole
laboratory to see if they could

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:90%
reconstruct the pyramids.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So they hired EG&G
for that purpose.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And they spent thousands
of dollars, maybe millions

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:90%
to actually try to build one.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.555 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They
were unsuccessful.

00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: They were unsuccessful.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't do it.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
They said we do not know
how today's technology could

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.623 align:middle line:90%
have built these pyramids.

00:10:11.623 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's incredible.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I know so many different
organizations and government

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
agencies who have tried to do
that, even on a small scale,

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:90%
and they still can't do it.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:84%
At some point, Bill Tompkins
worked with Wernher von Braun.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:10%
And he's the Nazi
rocket scientist

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:10%
who came to America as
part of Operation Paperclip

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:10%
after World War II.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where he
served as a director

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
of the newly-formed Marshall
Space Flight Center at NASA,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
what did he have to say
about his experience

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:90%
with Wernher von Braun?

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, he had one
dramatic experience with

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Wernher von Braun when he had
concluded that he was kind

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
of given the information
to suggest a design change

00:10:54.380 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
in the process of checking
out the spacecraft and also

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:90%
designing the complex.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So without company
approval, he went down

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and gave a presentation
to von Braun

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
as a result of his being
stimulated, he says,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
by his Nordic secretary
to work out the details.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And this was clearly
described in the book

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:84%
as a psychic communication
process during this visit.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:90%
But he went down.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:84%
He went into the
Huntsville facility.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing he noticed
was that the American flag

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:84%
had a Nazi swastika
in the bottom part--

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh my.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: --which I thought
was-- that was new.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:90%
I'd never seen that before.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But I've subsequently
seen a picture of that.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the process
was all kind of automated.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
That is, the guards
didn't stop him.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have a pass.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
They came down and
they took his display,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
which already is mounted
on a table, up the stairs.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And then he went into
the conference room,

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people sitting around.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And then von Braun came out
of one side, shook his hand.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And Kurt Debus, von Braun's
assistant, also from Germany,

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:90%
came out the other side.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And without much
ado, they encouraged

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
him to start his presentation,
which according to him

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
lasted for 40 minutes.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that, they applauded

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and thanked him so much.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And the follow on to that
was later on, that he got

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
fired by the company,
of course, because he

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.472 align:middle line:84%
had given this presentation
without approval.

00:12:33.472 --> 00:12:34.555 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I remember this.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:90%
You told me about this.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: And it turns out that
what he was proposing was that

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Douglas, McDonnell Douglas,
could have been the support

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.925 align:middle line:90%
group for the whole cape.

00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And that would have
been a $100 million

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:90%
contract over the years.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.145 align:middle line:84%
It turns out Boeing won it and
Boeing wound up buying Douglas.

00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Dr. Wood, weren't you
working there at that time that

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.122 align:middle line:90%
he got fired?

00:12:58.122 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Yes, as a
matter of fact, I was.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard this
rumor that there's

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
some guy from ground
support electronics

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
who went down and gave
a big pitch to von Braun

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and he got fired
because there was

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:90%
no management approval for it.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was related to
the fact that manufacturing

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and engineering were always kind
of at each other's throats too.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But anyhow, the top level
people decided to fire him,

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't-- they
couldn't afford to set

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
the standard that any engineer
who had a good idea could go

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.738 align:middle line:84%
down and give a briefing
without approval.

00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think there
might be some other agenda

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
in the higher ups that they
didn't want him to expose some

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
of that technology to him?

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: No, actually,
I don't think so.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a decision that
was made by manufacturing.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:84%
They said that we're not
a service organization.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Engineering likewise
had lots of things to--

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that it had built. And
actually, the vice president who

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:84%
made this decision
was my boss later,

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
the one who decided to
not proceed with a option.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
See, NASA did offer
us in response

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:84%
to this briefing an option
to go see the contract.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.108 align:middle line:90%
But we turned it down.

00:14:12.108 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Oh, and then he--
and then he went after that

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and still did it anyway.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: Yeah.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh goodness.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can see how
that would happen.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know
Wernher von Braun was

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
the head of the Apollo program.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at
a clip of Tompkins

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
from his time working
on the Apollo.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: OK.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.795 align:middle line:84%
>> TOMPKINS: So now I'm
Engineering Section Chief

00:14:33.795 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
at Douglas on the
Apollo program.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:10%
And I had 173 engineers and
designers and scientists,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:10%
actually 11 PhDs.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And I make the suggestion.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
These guys take it
and run with it, OK?

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Best group of engineers
on the planet, top guys.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And we put together a whole
new NASA program for the moon--

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:84%
threw out everything
that NASA had done,

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
came up with a
whole new one, OK?

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I submit it to the
heads of engineering.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:90%
They submit it to marketing.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And marketing talks to
the manufacturing people

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:90%
and they try to fire me, OK?

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Because manufacturing
wants to manufacture.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to do this
engineering stuff at all, OK?

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't get fired.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I get authorized to
go ahead and do this.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But marketing, we--
they wouldn't do it.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So the vice president
of engineering

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
said secretly, we're
going to do this ourself.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:90%
So I put the stuff together.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I have a six foot by six foot
model of the new NASA mission

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:90%
command center.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Looks just like a big theater,
with step down seating,

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:90%
screens on the wall.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So I put it onto a D-- brand-new
DC-7 and all my documentation.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:10%
And I fly down to the secret--

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:10%
Redstone Arsenal secret space
station, where all the Germans

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:10%
and where NASA is.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And I rent a truck.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in a three-piece
business suit.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
I rent this truck.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's got all these
gears that I've never run.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And I drive this
thing with a box in it

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:90%
into this secret area.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, but what's interesting
is that my secretary

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:84%
writes me a letter which will
get me to the top man in NASA--

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:90%
in Redstone Arsenal.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But she tells me I'm
not going to need it.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm driving up, she
tells me telepathically

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:90%
don't worry, Billy.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:90%
The gates are going to open.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm driving in and
these great big gates open.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I drive right on in past
an enormous area on the side

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
with dozens and dozens
of trucks and cars

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
and automobiles and
equipment where everybody

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
has to go through security
to check everything

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:84%
you've got in that truck,
get permission to take it in,

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:90%
So I drive right through.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:90%
The gate opens.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I drive in that thing and start
looking for von Braun's office

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I go through the
traffic of the base.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I get to the base,
finally, the tower.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:84%
The four security guards
of the building come down.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
They put their rifles
next to the building door.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
They're coming down
the stairway with

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:90%
a great big enormous dolly.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:90%
This dolly has four wheels.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle line:84%
They hold-- carry
it down the steps.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
They roll it over to my
truck and take the bars--

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:84%
the sidebars, the wooden bars
off the side of the truck.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
They take my model and
move it over to a dolly.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Where did the dolly come from?

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.065 align:middle line:90%
Why was the dolly there?

00:18:12.065 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
They carried-- pushed the
model in on the big dolly

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
back into a bunch of
offices, down a hallway.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
The elevator door, quite
large door elevator

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:84%
opens up with three
other elevators

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the center one.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:90%
The doors open up.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
They push this in.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I walk in with my
satchel full of my data.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:90%
We go up to the top floor.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:90%
The door is open.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
They, not saying a word, push
this dolly into the lobby area.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Those doors opened up.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:10%
We went into the
first big office

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:10%
area with all of
von Braun's people

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:10%
on this side and Dr.
Debus' people on that side.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:10%
The doors into this great
big conference room open up.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.535 align:middle line:90%
They park the dolly.

00:19:06.535 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:90%
They open up the box.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:84%
They picked this
model up that's got--

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
it's covered with
this soft blue cloth.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
They set it on the blue
cloth in the conference room.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Debus' secretary and
Dr. von Braun's secretary

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:90%
come over to me.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:90%
The four guards take this dolly.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:90%
They roll it back out.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.270 align:middle line:90%
They click their heels.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:90%
They salute.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:90%
And it goes downstairs.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, I haven't
said a word to anybody.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I came on board this facility
without any piece of paper.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:90%
I've come in.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:90%
I haven't talked to anybody.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And both of them already
know that I'm here now.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So von-- Debus' secretary said
that Dr. Debus will be here

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:90%
in just a moment.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. von Braun
will be here too.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Debus came out of
his conference room

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
and he introduced himself to me.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun came out
the other conference room

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and he introduced
himself to me too.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So now I've got this
great big blue thing

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.010 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of their
shiny conference room table.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:90%
I said I'm William Tompkins.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:90%
I come from Douglas.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And I have a proposal
that we'd like

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to present to you
on some changes we

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:84%
feel are necessary for the
Apollo to get to the moon.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody stops me.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Several of von Braun's people
come in and sit behind them

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:90%
on his table.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Debus' people sit with him.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Both of the
secretaries sit down.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:90%
And I start talking.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:10%
And at the right point, I pull
this cloth off and I am shown--

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:10%
I show them what you and
everybody else on the planet

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:10%
has seen, which is Complex 39's
launch control system, where

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:10%
you've seen Dr. von
Braun sitting up

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:10%
at the top and all the
engineers and everybody

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:10%
watching for stuff
on the screen.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:90%
So I live on with this.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And what took place was
they both heard my pitch.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It took me about 40
minutes on the pitch.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun shook my hand and
said we need to get together.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And Debus shook my hand,
put his arms around me,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and he took me to every top guy
in NASA there, introduced me

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:90%
as some sort of genius.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Beautiful but
tragic at the same time,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
because we know what
happened right after this.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And did he find
that out, of course,

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:90%
after he returned back to base?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
My recollection is that
it was just a few days.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't within hours,
but it was within days.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:90%
It was not weeks.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Now was he really hurt by this?

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.485 align:middle line:90%
Or where did he go from there?

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, he
thought it was crazy.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right, it was crazy.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: But Debus, who
he had just met in effect,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:84%
went out of his way to get
him a job at North American,

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Rocketdyne.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And they still
ended up using his technology?

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, the
main thing that he--

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
one of the main things he was
proposing was to make sure that

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:84%
they were checking out the
vehicles in a vertical position

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:90%
instead of horizontally.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, they
used that technique.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
He had a lot of
other ideas having

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
electronic checkout

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
systems, use of different kinds
of racks and stuff like that.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The details that he had in his
notes for the Apollo designs

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
were quite extensive in
terms of what he did--

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that is, he redesigned
the racks to reduce

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:90%
space and volume and weight.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And he was very good at that.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And that, actually,
not in any of the books

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.562 align:middle line:90%
now that I think about it.

00:23:32.562 --> 00:23:34.848 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, maybe
in the third book.

00:23:34.848 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: Maybe.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was amazing for
me to see that video.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:84%
He had told me that story
face-to-face before.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And so it was all the same.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In retrospect, I
mean, the fact that he just went

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
on this highly-classified base
with no problems whatsoever,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
did he ever figure that
out, like how that happened?

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Was it these Nordic
secretaries that had the in

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:90%
with their secretaries, maybe?

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: We talked about
that question personally.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of asked
him that question, not

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:90%
exactly in those words.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But he just concluded that
it was psychic actions

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:84%
of his secretary that
must have influenced

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
all these other people
to do their thing.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:90%
He did not know--

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
he was not given
any instructions

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
as he was driving this
truck or any of the things

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.130 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So these alleged
Nordic extraterrestrials had

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:90%
that ability--

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: Yeah, that's--

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --to maybe mind
control these people to make

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:90%
this happen?

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.382 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: That was the
conclusion I came to.

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I thought this is really
a remarkable story.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the same time
that he mentioned seeing

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:90%
the flag with the swastika.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of
extraterrestrials, I mean,

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:84%
there have been many stories
over the years from the Apollo

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:84%
astronauts, of course,
and the support staff

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:90%
about seeing alien craft--

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean domes of light on
the surface of the moon

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and other evidence of
extraterrestrial life.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:84%
What is Bill Tompkins'
experience about this?

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, Bill,
when he was at TRW,

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:22.300 align:middle line:84%
had access to some of the
overflights of the moon.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they were
involved in real-time talking

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.720 align:middle line:84%
to the astronauts
who were reporting

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
what they saw when they were
on the back side of the moon.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And they were seeing structures
being built from one pass

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:84%
to the other, an enormously
high rate in terms

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
of multiple feet per pass,
which has always puzzled me.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I question whether that
was really true or--

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
it was almost unbelievable that
they could build structures

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
that would go up hundreds
of feet in just one

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:90%
passage around the moon.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did he allude
to who they were?

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Or did he hear the
astronauts talk about that?

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: No, the astronauts had
no real data on who they were.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know anything
more than what they knew.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was he able to
hear the audio tapes from

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
the astronauts during
this discovery?

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> WOOD: Yes, he did.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And the astronauts were
talking to each other

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and to the ground.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Does he recall
anything that they said?

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.905 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, the kind of
things they were talking about

00:26:31.905 --> 00:26:36.040 align:middle line:84%
was the evidence of some
structures and the fact that

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
they were changing and getting
different on each pass,

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:90%
which was remarkable.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I think there were some
cases of lights, too.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:90%
But this is in the second book.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's really only one
page and a half, maybe,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.663 align:middle line:84%
of this conversation back and
forth with the astronauts.

00:26:54.663 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
impressed me was it

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
was Bill, real-time
with the astronauts.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's look at this clip.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:10%
>> TOMPKINS: First phase
was to get up there,

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:11.140 align:middle line:10%
pick up the rocks, take the
pictures, and get back, OK?

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.630 align:middle line:90%
So we get there.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.900 align:middle line:84%
We got all these vehicles
all around the rim.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of those nearly
pushed us out of orbit

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:90%
to try to even get in there.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Halfway to the moon it came
right up next to us, OK?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And so we don't--

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
the public didn't
hear the conversation.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The damn thing's
almost going to hit us.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Communication, mission control
right out of the vehicle.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you get there, but you've
spun around several times.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:84%
You've taken all your
pictures of all the stuff

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:90%
that's already there.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.800 align:middle line:90%
You know where you want to be.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And then as you
make your first run,

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:84%
here's all these
vehicles coming in,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.990 align:middle line:90%
these great big massive things.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And they go park around the
rim of where you got to land.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Holy cats.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:90%
So you land.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:90%
We have to do our thing.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the guy says
OK, go ahead and pick up

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.230 align:middle line:90%
some more rocks.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have
a problem, so do

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
two or three of your
additional missions

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and don't come back, period.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So was that mission
control telling him to do that?

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Or was it the beings?

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Well, in my opinion, it
was his interpretation of what

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
the beings wanted and mission
control was not involved

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.130 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of remark.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:84%
What was publicly
available and what

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.318 align:middle line:84%
mission control saw at
the top-secret level

00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:50.360 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But in my judgment, Bill made
up those words himself based

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:84%
on what he thought the
reptilians were trying to say.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you'll find in
any NASA communications, even

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:84%
top-secret, that they have a
record of the reptilians saying

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:90%
That would be my guess.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did Bill know
about any other secret Apollo

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:90%
missions?

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: Bill never talked to
me about other missions except

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:84%
the plans that were done
in Rocketdyne when he went

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
to Rocketdyne, which were
very extensive and long-range.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They were going to use the Nova
craft, which were basically

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.610 align:middle line:84%
hydrogen-oxygen vehicles, to
try to go to the nearest stars.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But that, in my
opinion, makes no sense.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
He did not imply to me that
NASA had secret Apollo missions

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't know about
or that there were any.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
His view was that he knew
all about the Apollo program

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and that there was no
top-secret part of it

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.590 align:middle line:90%
in terms of who went where.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Was he aware of any
anti-gravitic craft at that

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.510 align:middle line:10%
time that were
being used secretly?

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WOOD: The thing that puzzled
me about Bill's long-range

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Apollo mission planning was that
there were no indication of any

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravity units
being involved.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't have
done the missions

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that he was talking about to
try to go to planets of the 12

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
or 11 nearest stars without some
sort of anti-gravity devices.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And the planning details that
he was involved in at Rocketdyne

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:90%
did not have any of that in it.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So I concluded that either
this long-range planning was

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:84%
intentionally, covertly ignoring
the fact they were going

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to be using anti-gravity and
hoped that people would not

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.940 align:middle line:84%
make the calculations
and conclude

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.823 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't do it with liquid
nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:30:56.823 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, Bob, thanks
for being here and sharing all

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:90%
these amazing stories.

pleasure to be here.
