>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.982 align:middle line:84%
we're with Sergeant Clifford
Stone who has become

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:84%
a monumental figure in
the disclosure movement.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
He served 22 years
in the US army

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:84%
where he worked with an
elite secret group that

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
was dispatched to the
crash sites with orders

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to recover extraterrestrial
crafts, bodies, and technology.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Stone,
welcome to the show.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.297 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD STONE:
Thank you, sir.

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:41.548 align:middle line:84%
It's my great pleasure
to be here today.

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever
participated in any

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
recovery missions?

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Yes, sir, in my
entire military career events

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:84%
that actually involved,
and I hate to term UFOs,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
but for the sake of this
program I'm going to use UFOs.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I was involved with 12.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Actually, until I was called to
go on to a situation involving

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
UFOs I was a very
normal person and I

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:90%
had a real job in the military.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But when something happened
and they'd come and get me,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:90%
it'd always be the same thing.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
If I was at home, there'd
be a tap at the door.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd open the door, Ken would
be standing there and says,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
the general sends his greeting,
Sergeant Stone, code word

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Tabasco.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And it always remained
code word Tabasco.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We'd go ahead, grab my BA-50
bag, it was a gray one,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and it had all my
equipment that I needed.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:90%
It was already packed.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I had three changes of uniform.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd kiss my wife and kids
goodbye, and you'd go out.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
At no time did I feel that
ETs were a threat to us.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But because we really didn't
know what we were dealing with,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and there were accidents
because of the technology--

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: For the audience,
I think we should give a good

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
definition of a go bag, because
I also had to have a go bag

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
ready even after I left
the military, as you know,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
because you still are on
this kind of reserve status,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:90%
kind of not.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Like inactive reserve, but at
the same time when they call,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:90%
you have to go.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And explain to me,
what's in your go bag.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, what I had in
there, I had a Geiger counter.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I had equipment that would
go ahead and tell us if we

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:90%
had any background radiation.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I had equipment where if
there were certain debris

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that we needed like
chemical analysis,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I had equipment for that.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I had what we call a MOPP suit.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
That was a suit
that you'd put on

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
to protect you from
radiation things, this sort,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:90%
among other things.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%
I had my protective mask.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:90%
We had M782 masks at that time.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, three changes of
military uniform, because they

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.783 align:middle line:84%
want you to change
your uniform every day,

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
this type of case.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right, to keep clean.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>> CLIFFORD: Right.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.135 align:middle line:84%
And also you had
a radio, and this

00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
was hard to describe
at the time,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
but they changed it later on
because then they came out

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
with more better
technology, but it's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:84%
time we had what was
called a Prick 9.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: A Prick 9.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.288 align:middle line:90%
>> CLIFFORD: A Prick 9.

00:03:20.288 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
That was a radio,
real small radio

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that you could wear on your
belt, and you had an earpiece.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And they wasn't all that good,
but they served the purpose.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And all that stuff
was necessary,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
because once they came and
said, it's a go, you had--

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:90%
normally it'd be 30 minutes.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But with us, from that time
till the time we got in the car

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to go to the destination, which
we called the staging area,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:90%
we had 15 minutes.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And what was that like
getting to the staging area?

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Scary I never had
fear that our visitors would do

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:90%
anything to us.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember one
time we had this--

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:90%
we went inside this craft.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was totally
sterile, I mean

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:84%
nothing was like dirt on the
floor, nothing like that.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean like gleaming
silver colors

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
inside, except for some of
the things that they had,

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the switches and
things of this sort.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:84%
We went to one place and
there was these lights

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:90%
and there were these gauges.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Gauges were two
dimensional, which

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
means it was about
like a picture,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
the whole panel was green.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.307 align:middle line:84%
But they had these
circular gauges on them,

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and they would move, but you'd
think they wouldn't move.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:90%
It was like a hologram, sort of.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were they inlaid
into the flat surface,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: No, they were
like a flat surface right up

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
on the wall, for lack
of a better term.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But there was this place
that looked like a little--

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, like where
you'd have a rather large bolt

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
or nut that you'd
put back there.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So I took a screw
dioramas back there

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
working at the direction
of the guy I always

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:90%
called the colonel.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.665 align:middle line:90%
He was always in charge.

00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And while I was back
there moving that,

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.957 align:middle line:84%
there was a soldier
standing right here.

00:05:16.957 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know his
name or nothing.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But while I'm doing that,
the soldiers standing there,

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden I see like
a flash, and look over

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and he's not there no more.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And I went ahead and I asked
the colonel what happened?

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Where's the man that
is standing here?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Sergeant
Stone, he's gone.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need to know.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Keep continuing
with the mission.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, but, no, sir,
you don't understand.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
He was right there.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
He says, he's gone,
end of discussion.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Continue the mission.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you
ever find out why--

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.012 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: No, I never
found out what happened.

00:05:53.012 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I know what I want to believe,
what I'd like to believe.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do
you think happened?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I think that
something happened where he was

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
sent to another location,
another parallel dimension that

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
was along with us and somehow,
some way there was a slippage

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:90%
in space time.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.777 align:middle line:90%
He went through that slippage.

00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you think you
have any responsibility

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
in the disappearance of this
man because you were operating

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.702 align:middle line:90%
on the craft?

00:06:21.702 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Yeah,
I've always felt that.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I was the one doing something.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:90%
No one else.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Everyone else was watching.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you feel that
personal responsibility.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You have a responsibility
on these teams

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that's really overwhelming
when you get there.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And these things
happen, because we're

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
working with some
technology that we're

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
kind of prodding around because
we're not familiar with it.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And many times, disasters
and tragedy can happen.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Where did this happen,
and when did it

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
happen when you
were on this craft,

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:90%
and who shot that craft down?

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, this was
in Germany, and it was 1977.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
My family just got over
there and I was sent TDY.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And from the time
I was sent, that

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:84%
was a secret mission
I was going on.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Department of the
Army had an Inspector General

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.465 align:middle line:84%
out there who was sent
from the Pentagon.

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And there were several
things going on,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
because it took me a couple
of months to complete this one

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:90%
period of TDY.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if
it was shot down,

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
whether mechanical
difficulty brought it down.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And I have to be careful
about mechanical difficulty,

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
because I mean the engines
they had looked nothing

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:90%
like what we had.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:47.235 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine an engine
the size of a small matchbox?

00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: And the way that
they traveled was that matchbox

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
was an engine that used what
we called positron drive,

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:84%
what we call here, but more
sophisticated than anything

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that we even begin
to comprehend.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%
They would traverse wormholes.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And there'd be a
slippage sometimes

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
when they come into
our atmosphere,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:84%
because they'd have to exit
outside of our atmosphere.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But when they come
into our atmosphere,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
there sometimes
would be a slippage--

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and I hate using terms
of sound science fiction,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:84%
but I have to use it, because
they're the only terms I know.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Of course.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Slippage in
what we call space time.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
something can happen.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it with
mechanical difficulties,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:84%
technical problems with
craft, but we can't put it

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:84%
in the terms that we
understand the way we'd explain

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.245 align:middle line:90%
a jet aircraft crashing.

00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But anyhow, it
was on the ground.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing that would
indicate that it was shot down.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the
Soviet Union at that time

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
still had orders that they would
attempt to shoot down UFOs.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Almost other countries
were no longer doing that.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:84%
They were told to observe, and
if possible, take photographs.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
You had to be
careful about that.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
You being in the Air
Force, you realize

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
when you have gun
camera footage,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
you have actually
charged your guns

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and the other aircraft,
even with our technology,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
can very readily tell that
you have your guns on them,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
they're charged, and if
you wish to engage them,

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
you're ready to do so,
even though you're just

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:90%
taking pictures.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But that's the way I
saw it at that time.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We were like children.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
trying to do this,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:84%
there had to be
that coordination

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:84%
within the country, because
we were going to take

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:90%
total possession of craft.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Sarge, you
said it was in Germany,

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:90%
but can be more precise?

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Where in Germany?

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.232 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I was from Hanau,
but I don't really know.

00:09:50.232 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They went ahead and
put me on a train.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they wasn't
telling me where I was going.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to say it was
close to Stuttgart,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know how
close to Stuttgart.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.492 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what did the craft
look like from the outside,

00:10:06.492 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
including the inside,
but what was your first--

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: The craft looked
like a dish shaped object,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:90%
but it had protrusions on it.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
That was part of the
propulsion system of the craft.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it possible that
this craft looked this way

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
because it was from
another dimension,

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.362 align:middle line:84%
but in this dimension
it looks a certain way?

00:10:26.362 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Oh
it's very possible,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
because the whole situation is
that some of the craft that we

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:84%
came up in contact with were
not aerial dynamically sound.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And here again
with our visitors,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:84%
they can choose to
go ahead and play

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
with us, meaning
they can make it

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:90%
so they can be seen on radar.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They can also make it where
they are cloaked from the radar.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
We're working on
that right now also,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
not on the technology
that is very earthly,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:84%
but on the technology that
is light years away from us,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
because we have gleamed
a view of that technology

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
from things we have
recovered in the field, that

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:90%
advanced technology.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Sarge, what was
it like when you came up

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to the craft, you seen this
craft, and you walked on?

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:90%
What were the colors?

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:90%
What was the smell like?

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
You know these are
things that people

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
with your senses, our
normal human senses

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
pick up many things,
especially when I've

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.653 align:middle line:84%
gone on similar missions,
that's just overwhelming.

00:11:30.653 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, when
I first came up on it,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and this is always the
case, you're struck by awe.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here it is.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
You know no one on this
planet made that craft.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
You're wondering what new
and wondrous technologies may

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
be aboard this craft, because
you're always thinking about,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, they all seem like
they are together.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.305 align:middle line:84%
But there's various
degrees of technology.

00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And you'd think,
OK, well they're

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.847 align:middle line:84%
sharing so it's all going
to be the same technology.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:90%
And when we got to this craft--

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
now the side opening was
already opened when I got there.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
How that happened,
I have no idea.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
But they were waiting
for me to go in there.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of why they
wanted me to go in there

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:26.033 align:middle line:84%
was by being a individual that
could sense the beings, I mean

00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
it's about like you're an
old hound dog and go ahead

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
and smell the rabbits.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:90%
But you can sense the beings.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.195 align:middle line:84%
They had already been
picked up by their people,

00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:90%
because they do that.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:90%
They have rescue operations too.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.180 align:middle line:90%
All we had was the craft.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I went in
there, it was a strange--

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and I can't even
describe the odor.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But there was also the situation
where it's not like there was

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:90%
this heat-like ionized--

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
the smell of ionized air,
it's best way I can put it.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
You know it wasn't like the
electrical device burning

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, but
it was like it was ionized.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That makes
complete sense,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
because they need that in that
device the propulsion unit is

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
based off making ions around
the craft and inside the craft.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: And this is the
first time I was ever asked

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that, and I never
really thought about it,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:84%
but even now sometimes that
smell will come back right

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:90%
there at my home.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes two or three
times a week that smell

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.600 align:middle line:84%
will come back and haunt me,
and I will reminisce about some

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:90%
of these events.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Then, I will go and
try to do something

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:90%
take my mind off of it.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I know exactly--

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I feel like when there's a
lightning storm, and I feel--

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:90%
I smell that.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.348 align:middle line:90%
Or for some reason--

00:13:54.348 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I know this is going
to sound silly--

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.565 align:middle line:84%
when I walk in barns,
that hay smell--

00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like an organic smell, I
don't even know what that is.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Could you explain that?

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I
have no knowledge,

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
but we've experienced
the same thing.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I find it ironic
out of all the times

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about it no one has
ever asked me that question.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Maybe
they weren't there.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a hard, difficult
thing to explain.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love talking
to you, because we've

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.080 align:middle line:84%
had so many similar experiences
that you could make that up

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.878 align:middle line:90%
to me unless you were there.

00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: And what's really
hard to explain about the side

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:84%
opening, is that
there's no seams.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just like
it's part of the craft,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and it shouldn't be open
when they're in flight.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't open.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just like it just
slid down and opened there.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:90%
There was no seams.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.032 align:middle line:84%
There is no place where
it looked like it'd

00:14:57.032 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:90%
go back up in the wall.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But I just walked
up that little ramp.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:90%
It was about a 30 degrees slant.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got in
there, I saw the wall.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what laid
behind the other side.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
It was all metallic,
silvery gray, highly shiny,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:84%
completely sterile, and
I have to stress that.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So many movies have it where
they're all junked out.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:90%
No, that's my home.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:90%
That's not these craft.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
They go ahead and I
looked down to my right,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and it went on around the craft
because the craft was circular.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I looked down to
my left and that's

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.192 align:middle line:90%
where I saw all these panels.

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And I went on down there,
and the colonel says,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know
what these are,

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:90%
but those gauges seem to work.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But we went ahead-- we never
found anything in there.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: There was no
people in there and--

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.007 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, that's one of
the first things I was supposed

00:15:59.007 --> 00:16:03.590 align:middle line:84%
to do, was do you sense any
living intelligence here?

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I can sense
that there were biofactors--

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and I think you can understand
what I'm talking about,

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to explain,
that's still present.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But as far as living
entities, their people

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.948 align:middle line:90%
had already come and taken them.

00:16:20.948 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: On a lot
of these missions,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I've met a lot of people
that's similar to you,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
not like you have these
extra perceptions skills,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have sometimes
the right equipment to measure

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
things so we use people
to measure things.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you mentioned to
me about the biofactors,

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I just lit up, because
these biofactors when

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
you get on a craft are energy
signatures of the beings that

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
may have been there or maybe are
still connected to that craft.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And we pick up on this.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Is that why they
kind of chose you?

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I think that is one
of the reasons, but you know,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:90%
our visitors chose me first.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back from
the time I was a child.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:84%
Starting at the age of
four, not understanding it,

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
the events that was
happening to me.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I came from a very
religious background.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt that with these
things happening to me,

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that this is all
the Devil's work,

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:90%
and I was doomed to go to Hell.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
Now I know it's part of
an advanced technology,

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that it's part of a system
that our visitors use

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to understand our cultures and
our societies on this planet

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.030 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.447 align:middle line:84%
And I guess what
I'm trying to say

00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
is, there's some
psychic residue that's

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:84%
left behind when they're taken
that you can still pick up on.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So you still pick up
on some of the things,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
like here it was they
crashed on a strange planet.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:90%
They have no real ideal.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
They have a general
ideal, because they

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:84%
are told that we can be
violent against those things

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And the initial contacts
they're going to have,

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be with
people who are really

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:84%
conditioned to believe
in the non-existence

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:90%
of these entities.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
be afraid, and they

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
are going to use deadly force
without even being told to do

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:90%
so because of that fear factor.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're still
picking up on that.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
affects you because it

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:90%
intensifies your fear.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And you're going in so it
handicaps you a little.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It is.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like a magnetic--

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
you're like a
magnet, and whatever

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
energy was in that craft
is now you feel this.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.332 align:middle line:90%
in yourself.

00:18:50.332 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
You're not thinking it.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
That overwhelmingness
of sometimes good stuff

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes really
negative, and you have

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:90%
to really protect yourself.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
This psychic residue that is
left behind in these craft

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, is that
because they were taken--

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
or their people were
taken, or did we take them?

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, it
really makes no difference

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
as to whether we were to take
them or they were rescued.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But the situation is the
attitude of the psychic residue

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that's left behind is one of
happiness, and the one of joy,

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and you definitely know that it
was their people who took them.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not the sadness, the fear.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of times the--

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how
to put this to where

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be understood,
but if some of them are dead,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:90%
there's still that situation.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
They know they're going
someplace that they're--

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
everything has a soul
and it's going somewhere.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I say a soul, I
don't want it to be religious.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't want religion to have
anything to do with this.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to say there
is what we have is a shell.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
When we die there is this
life force that is everything

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:90%
we truly are.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:90%
It lives on.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%
The self never dies.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Now this is something
very hard to explain.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's something that needs
to be further researched,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and people need to
look at it even more.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, out of those 12
recovery missions, or the 12,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say missions, because
they're different I understand,

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.057 align:middle line:84%
which stood out the
most that affected you?

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: The very first
one there at Indiantown Gap,

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Pennsylvania.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you
explain this one?

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: We were on a
field training exercise, FTX,

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:90%
there in Indiantown Gap.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
We came from Fort
Lee, Virginia, which

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
was where my duty station
was, 36 Civil Affairs.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:84%
We went there for the
training exercise.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Right around midnight,
maybe a little after,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
my unit commander came
up to me and says,

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
they selected you because
you are NBC/COMMO.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:10%
You're going to be part of what
they're calling the B team.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew what he
was talking about.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
This was the first time
he ever heard of it,

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
be part of the B team

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
to go in support
and A team that's

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
already there in the recovery
or some type of craft.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I got out, and
of course, the person

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the leader of
this group came over and says,

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's what we have.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
We have an aircraft we believe
to be a Soviet aircraft that

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:84%
crashed not too far
from here and we're

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.488 align:middle line:90%
recovering that craft.

00:21:53.488 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's the storyline.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.238 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: That right there
was the officially sanctioned

00:21:57.238 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:90%
deception story they gave us.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:90%
So we're on our way out there.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're going and I don't
know how long we drove.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like for a
half hour, 45 minutes.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Then, we start
seeing these lights

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:90%
in the area where we're going.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.962 align:middle line:84%
We got closer, we saw
the people moving around.

00:22:15.962 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Then, we saw the craft.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The craft was like
the heel of your shoe,

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was at about
a 30, 40 degree

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:84%
slant because it
impacted with the earth

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:90%
and went into the earth.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How much
of the craft, Sarge,

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:90%
was sticking out of the earth?

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I would say
probably a little more than

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:90%
the third.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And it went in such a
way that we could still

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
look down and see the craft for
the most part, not only maybe

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:84%
a fifth or so was actually
buried into the ground,

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because it blew all the
other Earth up and around it.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there,
I was told to go ahead

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:84%
take my Geiger counter,
move towards the craft,

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and start calling all as
I got closer and closer.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:90%
So as we got--

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
as I got closer I'd
get one reading,

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and I called back how me
Rincons I was getting.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.130 align:middle line:84%
As I kept going
forward, I'd callback

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:90%
when it would rise a little.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Then when I got to the
top, I looked down.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I could see that there
was a canopy light

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the craft.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
On each side of
the canopy, there

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
was like a kidney
shaped opening.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And on the side that was
closest to me, which would be it

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
on the left side
of the craft, there

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:84%
was this a typical
gray creature.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.302 align:middle line:90%
It was half in, half out.

00:23:40.302 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How big was this body
of the creature hanging out

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:90%
of the craft?

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I've always
said about 3, 3 and 1/2.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are we talking about
the typical grays that pop

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:90%
culture talks about?

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: That's
what I was seeing.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But I went ahead and I knew
then that I needed an officer up

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:84%
One, I now knew this
was not a Russian craft

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
or any other craft
from any nation

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:90%
on the face of this Earth.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I kept yelling out about
I needed an officer.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:84%
When we were talking about
the psychic residue that's

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
left over, the living residue,
I can still pick up on the fear

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that this creature
had, and possibly

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
even some of the others that
were still on the inside.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't pick up on
any of them being alive,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:84%
but I could pick up
on that the sense

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:90%
of them having that emotion.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how to describe it,

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
of them not seeing
their families again,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.700 align:middle line:90%
and not being able to go home.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And that bothered me.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I kept calling back.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else less
emotional, less sensitive

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:84%
needed to be up there
as opposed to me.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's get
into the details.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:90%
You said it was about 3 feet.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It was like a typical gray.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:90%
But did it have--

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:90%
how many fingers did it have?

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Did it have feet?

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Did it have ears?

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Did it have-- what was
the size of the eyes

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:90%
if you could see that?

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, the head
was laid over like this way,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.050 align:middle line:84%
therefore, I
couldn't really see--

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I could see the
shape of the head.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
The head was
disproportionate to the body.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:84%
One arm was out like this and
the other went out like this.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:90%
I could tell it had fingers.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:90%
There was no thought of--

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:84%
no fault within me about
counting the number of fingers.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:90%
But I do know it had fingers.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:90%
It had hands.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:90%
The head was like--

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
explain it, but it

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
looked like it was two or three
times the size of the head

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:90%
like what we would have on us.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was more rounder.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And the gray, it was a much dull
gray, dull gray to almost white

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:90%
because the fact it was dead.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.355 align:middle line:90%
Also, you could see the mouth--

00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say you
like a slit for a mouth.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:90%
But I could swear it had lips.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:90%
The eyes-- the eyes were closed.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It had a very small nose,
and you can make out

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:90%
something that was like an ear.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Once again, when
you're confronted

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.727 align:middle line:84%
with something like this,
it's hard to explain.

00:26:44.727 --> 00:26:46.060 align:middle line:90%
You're not trying to take notes.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to
memorize because that's

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:90%
very human to be that way.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:90%
What I wanted to do--

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing something that
was assaulting my intelligence.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And I could identify on a very
human level the loss they felt.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were the arms
and legs in proportion--

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>> CLIFFORD: Very thin.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Very thin.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say again,
because most people--

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I hate doing it because you've
heard it 1,000 times over,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:84%
it had what looked
like a silver suit on.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And many of our
visitors wear this.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.345 align:middle line:84%
With that silver suit on,
it was like a one piece.

00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
From waist down it was
still inside the aircraft

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.440 align:middle line:84%
so I can't tell what
any of that looked like.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I was picking up on the
feelings these entities had.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in combat,
you'll turn from time to time

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and think about your
family, and you'll

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:84%
think about will my
family know that I wasn't

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:84%
a coward, that I did
my duty, and I died

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:90%
showing bravery and courage.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And with them, they
were on a mission here

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and they felt the same way.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to explain.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to go ahead and
tell people you're feeling.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
these emotions--

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling the emotions
that these entities had.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:84%
That's how I knew there
was more than one.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.362 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So there
was another one?

00:28:41.362 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: There were actually
three on board this craft.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what did
the others looked like?

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Oh, all of the
others I didn't get to see

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:90%
until the next day.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.240 align:middle line:84%
They had this what's
called a lowboy.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a 18 Wheeler, but
the bed is flat and maybe

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:90%
20, 30 foot in length.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
They took the craft
out of the impact area,

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
put it on the back
of the lowboy,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:84%
covered it with a
tarpaulin, tied it down,

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:90%
then they were taking it out.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But they had a gun Jeep front
of this vehicle and a gun Jeep

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.730 align:middle line:90%
in back.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure after they
got out into an open area,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that those gun Jeeps
turned into staff cars.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
But on the way out, they
had .50 caliber machine guns

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:90%
on the Jeeps.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How large
was the craft, sarge?

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I'd say
approximately between 25 to 30

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:90%
feet in diameter.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get to go
inside the craft,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know what
it's like on the inside.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But also, they had
these stretchers,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:84%
three of the
stretchers, and I could

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
tell that these were the bodies
they took out of the craft.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
They pulled back one, and
when they pulled back one,

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at it.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:90%
The eyes are closed.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Once again, you could
tell by the nose.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
The ears, they didn't
perk out like ours did.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
They were much closer
in, but you could still

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:84%
see that there's a protrusion
there for the ears.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:84%
On the uniform, it
had a red insignia.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make
it out real good,

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:90%
but it was like a check mark--

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
a check mark and like a
quarter crescent moon going

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:90%
on like this underneath of it--

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
actually going through
the check mark.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.255 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It looks
like a map of sorts.

00:30:32.255 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: It
very well could be,

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
but it could also be an insignia
of the organization to which

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.708 align:middle line:90%
in their world they belong to.

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What do you believe--

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.458 align:middle line:84%
that is, or did you ever
get debriefed later on?

00:30:48.458 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, they don't
make a point of debriefing you.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.458 align:middle line:84%
They will go ahead
and make a point

00:30:52.458 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:84%
of telling you that this
was a Russian craft that we

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:90%
recovered.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll at
some point tell you,

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.550 align:middle line:90%
this incident never happened.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.690 align:middle line:84%
We even told our pilots
that would intercept UFOs

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and when they came-- they
always got debriefed.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And we told the pilots all
the way back in the 50s,

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that if you ever
talk about this,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:90%
we can prove you were not there.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever seen
a craft from the outside,

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and then entered the craft and
it does not match the outside

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:90%
of the craft?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> CLIFFORD: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:33.670 align:middle line:90%
And a good example of that was--

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in Wyoming.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%
We went there.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:90%
We recovered a UFO.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Where in Wyoming I don't know.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I know it was cold.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:90%
I know it was a wooded area.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
About 30, 35 foot
diameter outside.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
We went inside and
were wondering, what

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:90%
the hey, I mean, it's so huge.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's so big.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: And I went ahead
and I told one of the soldiers

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.900 align:middle line:90%
there, we had a measuring--

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yardstick?

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Well, it pulled
out and you measured it.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But I went ahead and I
said, you get over there

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.210 align:middle line:90%
and you stand there.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, we're in
the center of the craft.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:90%
There are rooms around it.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, you hold onto it there.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Now this is 125 foot.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got a little
more in half way

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.430 align:middle line:90%
and we ran out of tape.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So when that happened I
said, are you holding that?

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:90%
No, Sarge, you're at the end.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And I mean here it is
we're at 125 feet, that's

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.170 align:middle line:84%
not the whole craft
even on the inside.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Right here is just the
center like maybe a launch

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.300 align:middle line:84%
bay or something where they
might launch smaller craft.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're wondering, OK,
what's going on here?

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So there was
actually a situation

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
where they could manipulate
space time inside the craft.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean you go ahead,
you have a craft

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:07.120 align:middle line:84%
that let's say that's
maybe only a couple inches,

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
you won't even notice
it on the ground.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the people are
the same size as us,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:19.490 align:middle line:84%
because they're manipulating the
dimensional reality as opposed

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to what it appears on the
outside on the inside.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Can I explain this?

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
As I always tell everyone,
I'm not a scientist.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I too I guess

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.847 align:middle line:90%
have the curiosity of a child.

00:33:33.847 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Of course.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: Initially I enjoyed
what I was doing except when

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:90%
the bad things happened.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Back then, no one knew what
they were really doing.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You were the one
that had to figure it out.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.742 align:middle line:90%
>> CLIFFORD: That was it.

00:33:45.742 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me because they
figured as an interfacer,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
train this, they got

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.733 align:middle line:84%
to find the people
on the outside.

00:33:53.733 --> 00:33:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The Problem
Solvers, they call them.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> CLIFFORD: They knew who--

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:02.080 align:middle line:84%
they knew I had this
contact from childhood on.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.955 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I
saw that person I always

00:34:03.955 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:84%
called Captain Brown,
he was the first contact

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:90%
I had with the military.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I felt
really good about that,

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.760 align:middle line:84%
because I told my mom and dad
when I saw my first daylight

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.413 align:middle line:90%
disk, that was in 1957--

00:34:18.413 --> 00:34:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How old
were you at that time?

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:90%
>> CLIFFORD: I was about seven.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.639 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what was
that experience like?

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:31.989 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: That
was like an epiphany.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Prior to the time,
I saw that disk

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:84%
in broad daylight, about 10:00
in the morning, clear blue sky.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.204 align:middle line:84%
And when it went over
from the back the factory

00:34:43.204 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:84%
buildings behind my
friend, Mike Eubanks,

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:84%
house flew directly overhead,
then went over his house.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was like
I had come to where

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I could touch to the very
edge of the universe.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:84%
No longer were UFOs
or flying saucers

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.350 align:middle line:84%
something I'd see in
science fiction movies,

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:90%
that I knew was fantasy.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Now I knew they were reality.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I knew the other people
was talking about them.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I now knew that they
had seen something.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I ran home to tell
my mom and dad.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Now I wanted to tell
the world, because I

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:84%
felt I had an obligation,
even as a kid,

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:90%
to share this information.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.620 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad,
much to my surprise,

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:90%
don't say anything about it.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:38.060 align:middle line:84%
The only reason I'm talking
now, it's not about me.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
It's about the guy,
the girl, the child,

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
who's going to have an
experience like what I had,

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:84%
going go through life the way I
went through life experiencing

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:90%
it throughout their life.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.880 align:middle line:84%
They, when it first happens,
they're on their own.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.435 align:middle line:84%
They go, they talk
to people, all

00:35:59.435 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:90%
that happens are laughed at.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.802 align:middle line:90%
They are made an outsider.

00:36:03.802 --> 00:36:05.260 align:middle line:84%
They feel alone,
because they don't

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.440 align:middle line:84%
know there's other
people out there that

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.587 align:middle line:84%
shared the exact or
similar experiences.

00:36:11.587 --> 00:36:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want them to know there
are other people out there

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
just like them, and it's
about like a support group

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:90%
if you wish.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But until we take a stand
and state, you know what?

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to let
this next group of people

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.870 align:middle line:90%
be on their own.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.520 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.880 align:middle line:84%
A generation from now, there
are going to be people like you

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and like me, that have
shared the same thing.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, many of
them will make the decision

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.767 align:middle line:90%
to come out and talk.

00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it's going
to come out in the open

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.555 align:middle line:90%
where the world's going to know.

00:36:48.555 --> 00:36:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, thank
you for coming forward,

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.330 align:middle line:84%
because it's an intense,
emotional thing to do.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're a hero in
my book for doing so.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.780 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> CLIFFORD: I'm a scared little
man that feels that he has

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:84%
a purpose, and a moral
obligation to come out and talk

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And that's why
we're here, to educate.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Sarge.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:90%
That was so fascinating.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the show.
