00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Jason,
thanks for joining us.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON RICE: Oh, thank
you for having me, Jay.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: A lot of people
are commenting on time,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:10%
and going backwards,
and new timelines,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:10%
and they don't
quite understand it.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to reiterate
how it works in detail.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Certainly.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:10%
The 20 and Back Program is
based on removing a person

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:10%
from their everyday,
regular life

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:10%
and putting them
into a space program,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:10%
or a classified
project, or something

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:10%
other than their normal life.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
They continue living
their 20 years just

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:84%
like everybody else in
their initial origin life.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that 20-year
period, the bifurcation point,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
the separation from the original
timeline, the person that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is on their 20 and Back
gets age regressed back

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to the age they
were physically when

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:84%
they started with the Secret
Space Program, for example.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're age regressed and
then sent back through time

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:84%
to the time period
that they left

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:90%
their initial original timeline.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you have a
single line representing time

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:90%
even though time is not linear.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
The split comes when I am
living on this initial timeline

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of my family.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It splits, and my existence
goes and does other things.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
The rest of my
family and everybody

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
else continues on with
their original course,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:90%
the original time.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I am also living out 20 years
parallel to everybody else.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: At the end of
that 20-year period,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I circle back to the point I
originally split from and get

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:90%
reinserted at that point.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So the 20 years that
I lived parallel

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
are still valid, still there,
but it ends and returns

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:90%
to the initial separation point.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So therefore, the 20
years that your family lived

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:90%
didn't exist.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Without me, yes.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Or is it in a different
plane and still there?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Probably that.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There's
questions to that.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that our
understanding of time, space,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and space-time is
one that's growing.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And with full disclosure,
and the technologies,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and the science, and
the math, and everything

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that comes with
that, I think we'll

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.972 align:middle line:84%
have a better understanding of
what space-time time space is.

00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, I hope
that clears things up

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.475 align:middle line:84%
for people because it
is a difficult subject

00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It is.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:90%
It is a hard concept to grasp--

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and a paradox.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You talked about that
in your hypnosis session.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what you said.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: He talked
about the 20 and Back.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HYPNOTIST: About the--

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: He told us
that we would all be

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:10%
able to go serve for 20 years.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:10%
>>HYPNOTIST: Mhm.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.302 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And then at the
end of that service,

00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
we would be returned
back to the original time

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and place that we
got our orders.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And they went
through the numbers,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:90%
showed us a chart and a graph.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Here's how much
you'll be making.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Here's how much we'll be
taking out for your care.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
your 20-year period,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.296 align:middle line:84%
you should have $465,000 that
you'll be taking with you.

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:19.706 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: Mhm.

00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:21.152 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: [CHUCKLES]

00:04:21.152 --> 00:04:25.008 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:90%
We were all fools.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
They told us that we
would be age regressed.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And after seeing the technology,
and being injected with it,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and being physically
changed, I had no doubts

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that they'd be able
to age regress me.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: Mhm.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.466 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They didn't tell
you if you survived.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.025 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them didn't.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All right, let's
go back to our chronology.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: OK.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The last time we
visited, you were telling us

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:84%
about they had made you sign
a whole lot of documents,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and then you joined
something called IDARF.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: The Interplanetary
Defense and Reaction Forces

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:10%
were a unit that was border
patrol, used for assistance

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:10%
on other planets.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
However, there were a number of
training exercises and training

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
periods that we
spent here on Earth.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
One of them was in
Antarctica, another one

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:90%
is in the South Pacific.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But those were some of the
final exams, if you will.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So now let's
go back to that day.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
You're now-- you're done with
your meeting with the captain.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: What happens next is he
shows me to my quarters, which

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be very similar
to a hotel room, any hotel

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:84%
room across the world
that you'd walk into.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It has a bed, a closet, a
small bathroom, a dresser,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:90%
a bedside table, a lamp--

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
just your basics, no
windows, no TV, no radio.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No computer?

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No computer.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.893 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: So I'm shown to my room.

00:06:08.893 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I walk in, and the
captain says, see you later,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and leaves me with
my stack of manuals

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and new uniforms
and new equipment.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Manuals?

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.948 align:middle line:90%
What are these manuals?

00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's basically
the instruction books.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: For weapons.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: For everything.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.406 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: For everything.

00:06:24.406 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Everything, be it land
mines, or area denial field

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
generators, or your plasma
rifle, your pulse pistol,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:90%
any number of things.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was about
11 o'clock at night

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
by the time I made
it to my quarters.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:90%
I was mentally just wiped out.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I took a shower, and
then came and pushed everything

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
off the bed, and crawled
in bed, and went to sleep.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I woke up the next morning.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a very fitful
night's sleep.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of it
had to do with the fact

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that it was not the Schumann
resonance in the background,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and my body physically wasn't
used to that atmosphere

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:90%
or that environment.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:10.741 align:middle line:84%
I got up early the next morning
and went to look for, OK,

00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to shave?

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And how am I going
to brush my teeth?

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I found something
that was referred

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to as a nanite
epilation equipment.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what epilation
was, but I had no idea

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:90%
at the time what nanites were.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
This is 1996, and so it was long
before it became a common term.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: So I found the manual.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And after reading
through it, it explained

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:84%
that it uses a binary
compound that when

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
combined activates
nanites that when

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
applied through this device
dissolves the follicle

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:90%
of the hair without water.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
finished, you take a towel,

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and you wipe, and the remaining
hair just wipes right off,

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
smooth, lasts for about-- they
said it lasted for 45 days.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Mine, because of
my hair follicles

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and how thick they
are, lasted about 30.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:90%
But supposedly, it lasted--

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I was amazed.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And unbelievable--
where is this?

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't we ever
see this before?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was another product
of the Secret Space Program.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
They specifically
used it to save water.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Shipboard, you don't have
a lot of water to use.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:90%
You don't need water to use it.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Same thing applies to
the next item on my list

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
that I had to find,
which was the toothbrush.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It was just, again, a
binary component cream

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that was in a tube
similar to what we use.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And it has a special
fitting at the end of it

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that releases a very specific
amount of each compound

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:90%
into a chamber where it mixes.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:90%
And it tasted like chalk.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It felt like there
wasn't enough of it.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But after 30 minutes
or so, my teeth

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:84%
felt like they'd just been
cleaned at the dentist.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, don't need water,
don't need to use water.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to produce
waste water because

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:90%
of a need for the hygiene--

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
another shipboard convenience
that they had to consider.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, so now you've
got your-- you're shaved,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:90%
and you brushed your teeth.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's your second
day in the Secret Space

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.147 align:middle line:90%
Program, second time around.

00:09:27.147 --> 00:09:27.946 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What happened next?

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I went in
search of my uniform

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't about to put
on my BDUs from the day before.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I found that the new
uniform had a digicam pattern,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and it had a V-shaped pattern
for the name tag and the unit.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the wrist area on
each forearm was another pouch.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It was part of the
medical kits that we

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
wore as part of the feedback
system between our computer

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
systems and the medical
systems that we wore.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The pants and the blouse
both had a liner in it.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And the liner, it was
a holographic material.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.565 align:middle line:90%
And it's got a hologram in it.

00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, except this
was a material.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was also the thinnest
material that I'd ever held.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:90%
It was tough.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:90%
It was rugged.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, now you got
your nice new uniform.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Were you hungry?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was about that time.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So I did my morning exercises,
and stretched, and made my way

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:90%
to the cafeteria.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What did you
find in the cafeteria?

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I walked
in, and, well, there

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:84%
were these what looked like
stainless steel shelves.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It had an overhang
above it, and it

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
had borders about
3-inches wide on the side,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and the top also had about
a 3-inch-deep border.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:90%
And there was a single--

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:84%
looked like a black, painted,
square button, three of them.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So I walked over to the closest
one and put my finger on it.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And humming started, and
then a faint, misty light

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:90%
appeared right below it.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And then in front of my eyes, I
saw a bowl with butter appear.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:90%
So I knew what I'd just done.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I'd just used my
first replicator.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.596 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what all
these other bays were.

00:11:28.596 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, I'm
excited at this point.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow, excellent.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.410 align:middle line:90%
What do I get to use?

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:90%
This is Wonderland.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the other
end and grab my tray,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.150 align:middle line:90%
and I start going down the line.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:90%
And I push each button.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm going
to push them all

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
see what happens.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And the first one had
had eggs, and second one

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:90%
had a bowl of grits.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%
I end up with bacon and toast.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I picked up my
butter, and the last one

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:90%
had a glass of water.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So that was probably
the happiest plate

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
of plain scrambled eggs
I ever had in my life.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So these
replicators, they

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
can make any food you want?

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they're
pre-programmed for what

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.339 align:middle line:84%
the meal is that day, but
you just get to select,

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:90%
and whether you want it or not.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
That day was a very,
very busy day for you--

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.753 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: --your second
day in the Secret Space

00:12:13.753 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Program, second time around.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your daily life

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.008 align:middle line:84%
during this training,
what you were

00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
doing, what you were
learning, all the things that

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:90%
were going on.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So that day was spent walking
from one side to the other,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
getting to know people,
signing up for--

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
[SCOFFS] signing up for
pay, which never ended up

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:90%
coming through after 20 years.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But that was, again, part
of the disinformation,

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
keep people's morale
up and thinking

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to get paid.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Then another thing
that day that we did

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
was to go ahead and pick
up the number of postcards

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
sending to our family.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, that was part of
their process of making sure

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that questions weren't
asked back home about people

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%
that were missing.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And what would they do?

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, all these postcards, you
fill out a whole bunch of them,

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
just slowly send them

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:90%
like every few months?

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I found it very peculiar writing
a happy birthday for somebody

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
writing a happy belated
birthday as in I

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
was writing it late
for somebody that was

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.651 align:middle line:90%
having a birthday in a year.

00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that was
one of the things.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
They had an exact
number of cards

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:90%
they wanted us to fill out.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And they told us what to put
on there in our own writing.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:90%
But they told us what it was.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:45.731 align:middle line:84%
And I get the feeling that
it was AI-generated dialogue

00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:90%
that they had us put on there.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.355 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you
think some computer

00:13:48.355 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:90%
was kicking all this out.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, I think it was
a computer kicking it out

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:90%
based on our psych profile.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:90%
And each one was customized.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you never ever sent a card
late, you wouldn't-- like me--

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have to write
a belated early happy late

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:90%
birthday.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.152 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Another one
of the stops that day

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
was in the
psychiatrist's office.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And part of the process
for sending you back

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is having a very specific
baseline on when you came in.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize it at
the time, but it was also

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes
of the mind wipe so

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that they know how
things happened,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
what happened, exactly
what color things were.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Where was this?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And where was that?

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And they ask you 12 ways from
Sunday the same question.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And you're sitting in a chair.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They've got sensors on the
walls and in the ceiling that

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
can monitor your biorhythms
to see if you're lying or not,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
similar to a polygraph except
10 or 15 times more advanced.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:00.469 align:middle line:84%
And that happened every
week, one day a week.

00:15:00.469 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And this was
done because they

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
knew they were going
to wipe your mind,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.183 align:middle line:84%
and so all the
memories would be gone,

00:15:05.183 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
so they had to make sure
that they got it all down.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That they
got it all down.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that you've
gotten that, what

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:90%
did you do next on this day?

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The large part
of that morning was spent

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
in the medical lab section
and had to do with some

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:90%
of the enhancements that the--

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What enhancements?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The enhancements
that we were being given

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
were the nanite
enhancement therapy.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Why would they do this?

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: What they told us,
the reason for the NET,

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:84%
the Nanite
Enhancement Therapies,

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
was to give us the best
chances of survival.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, how
would they help?

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:90%
How would it help you survive?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, every single bone,
lymphatic, glandular, organ,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
tissue, there wasn't
a single system

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
in the body that
wasn't enhanced,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have a nanite
enhancement put on it.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It would add to your
abilities for your vision,

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.510 align:middle line:84%
for your hearing,
for controlling

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:90%
your adrenal glands.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Say, for instance, if
you were in a situation

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:84%
where you didn't have food
and you needed to control

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:90%
your hunger, you could do that.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And you could adjust how your
body is distributing nutrients.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:90%
You could adjust your eyesight.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:90%
You could zoom on your eyesight.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:90%
You could see in the dark.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.511 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You could hear things
at different frequencies

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that humans aren't
normally able to hear.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:84%
The standard protocols
for every cell,

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
every system in your body,
are radiation protocols,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
which are for repairing
damage from radiation because

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.945 align:middle line:90%
of being in space.

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so you may
get a certain type of NET

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
for, say, your organs,
and a different type

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
for your auditory, and yet a
different type for your joints.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
But all of them get the
anti-radiation protocols.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And it
sounds a little bit

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
like they're trying to
create a super soldier.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It does.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
It does, but we didn't
look at it that way.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:84%
We looked at it like putting
on a suit of armor, protection,

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:90%
like something that was--

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't change
our natural strengths

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:90%
and weaknesses.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It helped to augment them.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And the training that we went
through wasn't geared towards,

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're a better
person, and you're

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
a premium, optimal
example of a human.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:84%
No, these are tools
that you have to use.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And it took all of the 18 months
of learning from the training

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.697 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to use the
different nanite enhancements.

00:17:57.697 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are these
nanites still in you?

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are they flushed
out of the body or what?

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They are flushed out
at the end of the 20 and Back.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And as part of
the out-processing

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that you go through
for the age regression,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:84%
you also get cleansed
of all the nanites.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:20.466 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: These nanites
also control your health?

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They
control your health.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:84%
They control your
blood sugar level.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
They control the healing
response that your body has.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take over.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It just augments.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So if it would take two weeks
to heal a cut on your arm,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.200 align:middle line:84%
it would speed up the process so
that it would take only hours.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Can these
nanites be hacked?

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They can.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They can.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And we were
scanned regularly,

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't realize it
at the time what for.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But knowing what I know now,
we were scanned regularly

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:90%
for the AI threat.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Could you run faster too?

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Not necessarily
faster, but if you

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:84%
could maintain your top
speed unenhanced, say,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
for a mile and a half,
you could do it for five.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So it's not
that you went faster,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
but your abilities
to sustain yourself

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.335 align:middle line:84%
at a high-performance
level were enhanced.

00:19:21.335 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What about
reaction times?

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Did they increase?

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The reaction
times for us

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
were driven mostly by the
intuitive empath abilities.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Ah, right.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:35.355 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So not necessarily
were they sped up.

00:19:35.355 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Because you
already have the equipment

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
with the intuitive
empathic ability,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:90%
so you don't really need that.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, yep.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's
interesting how this

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:90%
is all kind of coming together.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.065 align:middle line:84%
Very well thought out
how they did this.

00:19:47.065 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It was not anything new.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:90%
We weren't Guinea pigs.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
That was a well-developed,
very mature program.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.411 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Again, we'll take a
look at your hypnosis session.

00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HYPNOTIST: When he
talked about changes,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
what sort of changes
was he talking about?

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:90%
To the physical body?

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The changes
that I'd seen

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:84%
in the last day, the medical
in-processing involved

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:84%
enhancements,
nanite enhancements.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HYPNOTIST: What
does that mean?

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Microscopic machines--

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: Oh, OK.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --injected
into our bodies

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
so that we would have
enhanced systems.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
body was affected.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.837 align:middle line:84%
>>HYPNOTIST:
Everything is affected?

00:20:45.837 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Everything was affected.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: Yeah, in what way?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If nothing else, it was
for anti-radiation protocols.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: Oh, OK.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Some of it was for
different poison protocols,

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:10%
enhanced vision, enhanced
hearing, healing abilities,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:10%
enhancements to our pituitary
glands, to our pineal glands.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.424 align:middle line:84%
>>HYPNOTIST: The
glandular system as well?

00:21:18.424 --> 00:21:19.257 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: All of them.

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HYPNOTIST: Mhm, make
you efficient machines.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, the better to use.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: Better use, oh.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Did they tell you how they
were going to use you--

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HYPNOTIST: --this
efficient machine?

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: No?

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, they didn't, except
that we were going to be used

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:90%
off planet--

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HYPNOTIST: Off planet, oh, OK.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: --out of
our solar system.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How many soldiers were
in with you in this training?

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The total number
of Earth-provided soldiers

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:90%
amounts to about 24,000.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.151 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And were they
all different races?

00:21:56.151 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Different races.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And sexes?

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Male, female,
different countries.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sizes?

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Tall, short?

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Full range.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Any majority
race, Chinese or-- no?

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:07.671 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Nothing like that.

00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:11.749 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Only program that
I'm aware of is the MILAB.

00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
However, other
countries have to have

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:84%
their own means of recruiting,
training, selecting.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So I imagine that other
countries are probably

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:84%
either modeled after,
or are copies of,

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
or are very similar
to the MILAB program.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:90%
But they do exist.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So how many
people were in your unit?

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The smallest
unit size was a squad.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: A squad.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And they consisted
of eight to nine individuals.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And then going out from
there was a platoon.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And then there were four
platoons per company

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and two to three
companies per battalion.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
It's arranged very similar
to Western military order

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:90%
of battle.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So you're at this
training facility.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.820 align:middle line:84%
You've now used the
food replicator.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
You've brush your teeth
with this odd nano-thing.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.354 align:middle line:84%
And now it's the
day of the briefing.

00:23:11.354 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a day and a half later.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
They've told you they're
going to brief you.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Finally, some answers.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
at the briefing?

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, we walked in
and go into the auditorium.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of the other
trainees from my class

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:90%
were in there at the same time.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
packet waiting for you

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:84%
because the auditorium is set
up like a college classroom that

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:84%
has one of the foldable desks
alongside of the chair--

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:90%
no frills, very basic.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
But on each of the desks
where we were to sit

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.170 align:middle line:84%
was a package waiting for
us that included paperwork

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
for signing, more information
on what we were doing.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:90%
They started the briefing.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
The colonel that was in charge
of the training regiment

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:84%
came up, and he was German,
and started the briefing

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
by telling us that
we were asked here

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
because we have special talents
and abilities that they need.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And what we were
going to be used for

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:84%
was the tip of the spear,
patriotism, stars, stripes,

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
all the things that appeal to
a young officer that's looking

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.065 align:middle line:90%
to help out his country.

00:24:19.065 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
We were going to be helping
planets defend their planets

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:90%
from alien invasion.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:90%
And he was German?

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: He was German.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: A thick German accent?

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.799 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A thick German accent.

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't US
military because this

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:90%
isn't the US military.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, he was not.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And another thing I
noticed at the briefing

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the senior brass
up on stage were also German

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.210 align:middle line:90%
and that there was no--

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and they all had thick accents.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And there were no Western
or European senior officers

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.016 align:middle line:90%
present on the stage.

00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:51.815 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:24:51.815 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:84%
That probably alerted you
right away there's something--

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.311 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That was a
big sign at first.

00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, that's
very interesting.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:90%
So then what happened?

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, they talked about
the origins of their program

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
in which there was no mention
of alien ETs or assistance

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
from aliens.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They took all the
credit for the themselves.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Took all
the credit for it.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I knew you were
going to say that.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Did not
say anything at all

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
about a breakaway civilizations,
didn't say anything at all

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
about the Earth's cabal,
no mention of that at all.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
how much money we'd

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:84%
end up with at the end
of our 20 and Back,

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.856 align:middle line:84%
we would get credited
with on our return.

00:25:30.856 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they were
going to charge us

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
for room and board and
some of the equipment

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that we'd be using
and going through.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:90%
But it was just minor charges.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:90%
They were charging you?

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: By taking it back out.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.149 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, my god.

00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so at
the end of the day,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
we were supposed to have this
nice, fat, shiny check waiting

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
There was no mention
of mind wipe.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%
There was discussion
about the 20 and Back

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and that when we're finished
with our term of service

00:25:55.910 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that they had the technological
ability to regress our age

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and then send us back in time
to the point in which we left.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you're going to be 24.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
And you're going back with a--

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: A nice
retirement nest egg.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What a great life.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They made
it sound that way.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.075 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, they didn't
mention anything about the mind

00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:16.928 align:middle line:90%
wipes or--

00:26:16.928 --> 00:26:19.302 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What did you do with
your money when you got back?

00:26:19.302 --> 00:26:22.084 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: [LAUGHS] What money?

00:26:22.084 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You mean the Germans
weren't telling you the truth?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They weren't
telling us the truth.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I can't
even believe that.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The history
that they presented in

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.265 align:middle line:90%
that briefing was very spotty.

00:26:34.265 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:84%
It did not have much in
the way of information.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The information
that they put forth

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
was more of the
propaganda side of it,

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of how great it was that we
were going to be helping out,

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and how much benefit
we'd be providing

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to not only our own families and
country but to the human race.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It was a load of BS.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It was the propaganda
lies that they use

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.402 align:middle line:90%
to try and get people on board.

00:27:01.402 --> 00:27:02.201 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:27:02.201 --> 00:27:03.002 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:27:03.002 --> 00:27:03.917 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: And it worked.

00:27:03.917 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it did.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
There was no mention of what
they were going to do later

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:90%
at the end of our training.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Similar to Cortes
burning his ships,

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:84%
they notified our families
that we had died in action.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we wanted to,
we couldn't go back

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.190 align:middle line:84%
because all our families
thought we were dead.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
They either provided no
body, in which it was just

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.170 align:middle line:84%
an empty casket, or they
provided a clone in the cases.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And they provided some
clones so that people

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.450 align:middle line:84%
would have a body that looked
just like their loved one

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:90%
to bury.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so there
was no turning back.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:90%
They didn't tell us that.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say
anything about that.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.160 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]
