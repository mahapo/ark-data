>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:10%
we have Sergeant
Clifford Stone, who

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:10%
has many experiences
in the military dealing

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:10%
with extraterrestrials.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Stone,
welcome to the show.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD STONE:
Thank you, sir.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.332 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:00:31.332 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the
United States Army's

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:90%
interplanetary research?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: It was the United
States Army interplanetary

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
research unit that
wasn't a unit.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:84%
This was a group of
field-grade officers.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there
was much more to it,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
but they would meet in a
certain room in the Pentagon.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Its whole purpose was
to go ahead and try

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to work with the exploitation of
the advanced technologies that

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
was coming to them to create
a program in which they could

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and make a rocket that
would, in fact, go to the Moon

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and come back to
the Earth safely.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
But they had to get
this information

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:84%
from debris of crashed UFOs
and things of this sort.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So who was part of this
unit, and why was it created?

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:10%
>>CLIFFORD: Well, actually,
in 1942, Douglas MacArthur

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:10%
asked General Doolittle
to go ahead and find out

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.633 align:middle line:10%
what was behind all the these
reports of foo fighters.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They were seeing them
in the European theater,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and they were seeing them
in the Pacific theater.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
The Allied command
was to the point

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
where they were
acknowledging they were real.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:90%
They existed.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And they concluded
that they were

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
some new advanced technologies
of the Axis Powers.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But they had shown no
signs of hostility.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Doolittle came back
and told MacArthur

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:84%
that we had spectators
of this worldwide event

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
we called the Second
World War who did not

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:90%
originate from this planet.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he
stated "outer space."

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know things
about multidimensional,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional
possibilities at that time.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So they concluded
that these were,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
in fact, interplanetary
visitors,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.152 align:middle line:90%
probably from Mars or Venus.

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they know back
then that they were coming back

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and forth already to the Earth?

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: No.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.653 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
about it at that time

00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
because there was no real
intelligence organizations

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
within the US government until
just before the Second World

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Then when that came
into being, then, you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
know, it was MacArthur, who
he had to get up and go.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to know
what these things were.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:90%
So they hit up on that.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.108 align:middle line:90%
It was MacArthur.

00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Air Force
didn't exist at the time.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, the army.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: It was
the Army Air Corps.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force would
not come into existence

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
until the National
Security Act of 1947.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So with it being the Army Air
Corps, the Army still had,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, control over
everything along those lines.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
There were enemy aircraft
that got shot down.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we were
always interested

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
in trying to find out
any new technologies that

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
might be involved in the
aircraft the Axis Powers were

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:90%
using.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: And there was no
special order given about, OK.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Jap zero went down here.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.567 align:middle line:84%
We need a special team
to go out and get that--

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Retrieval--

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Retrieval
on that craft.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
It would be who was
ever out there, get it.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Bring it back.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we would have
experts take a look at it.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
That changed after
MacArthur found out

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that these were not just events
where aircraft went down,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
that there were some craft that
may actually have some very

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:90%
unique things on them.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what
did they discover?

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.965 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Well,
they discovered

00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that there were certain
craft that were not

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:90%
generic to this planet.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, it became
necessary from the time

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
they were discovered to the
time they were delivered

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:84%
to a rear echelon area,
where experts go over

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
them to be specialized--
by a specialized team.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.015 align:middle line:84%
So it would no longer be
to the foot soldier that

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
was out there to get it
back to an area where

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
they could package it and send
it back to a safe haven area.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, they needed
that special team.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:10%
This right here
is a 1944 document

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:10%
that clearly shows that
there would be an officer

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:10%
and team of personnel.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:10%
And this officer and
team of personnel

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:10%
would go ahead with crashed
aircraft, take control of them,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:10%
and get them back to
that safe haven area.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.192 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And who was in
charge of these people?

00:04:59.192 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Well,
in this instance,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
it would actually have been
MacArthur, because this

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
is from the Pacific.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing,
if you had an ID card,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:90%
you got your picture on it.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:90%
You got your signature on it.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
This made it clear and
that introduces the fact

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
that this officer is the
one that's in charge.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.642 align:middle line:84%
He's going to take charge
of that crashed aircraft.

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to move
it back to a safe haven

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.305 align:middle line:84%
area in the rear, where
experts can look at it.

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, they didn't
have anything like that.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the
significance of this document?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Well,
prior to that time,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
from the start of the
war all the way up to--

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
actually, this came
into being in 1942.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
But all the way up
to '42, you know,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
it didn't matter who had access
to that crashed aircraft.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter how it got
back to a safe haven area,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.340 align:middle line:84%
if it ever got back
to a safe haven area.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:84%
They could look
at it at the field

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and do what we call "field
exploitation" of that craft,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:90%
then move on.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
This right here
made it to the point

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
where now, there were
specialized people trained

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
in the specialty of moving that
craft from where it was located

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
to a safe haven area in the rear
where experts could look at it

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and exploit the technology
that was in that craft

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
or on that craft because this
was technology that was not

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
technology that
originated on this planet.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
reverse engineer

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.018 align:middle line:90%
any of this technology?

00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Actually,
from the onset,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
they started to go ahead
and find out certain things.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What type of things?

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: I don't
know for a fact.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.798 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove it, but
you'll hear stories

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:42.262 align:middle line:84%
coming out of Vietnam
about them having

00:06:42.262 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:90%
enemy soldiers on the ground.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they disappeared

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
when a helicopter would
go over and shoot, like,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
a beam of light down to some
of these enemy soldiers.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Those were known as "lasers."

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were
military-strength lasers

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that could go ahead and cut
through metal and really

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:90%
totally disintegrate a person.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether we used
those in Vietnam or these

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
were just stories because
people knew those weapons were

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:90%
in existence, I don't know.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I do know that during
Vietnam, once again,

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
like every other war
we had, we had UFOs.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were told--
our people were

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:84%
told, you identify these as
unidentified aircraft are

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:84%
enemy helicopters-- keyword,
not "unidentified helicopter,"

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:90%
but "enemy helicopters."

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:90%
We went ahead.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:90%
We bonded them.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We tried to go ahead
and intercept them.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:84%
The word was, don't shoot them
because they could be Allied

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
aircraft, Allied helicopters
on friendly missions.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But when you have a helicopter
that an F-105 Thunderchief

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
cannot go ahead and catch up
with, that's some helicopter.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's amazing.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.563 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: So during the
whole course of the war,

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:90%
we never got--

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
officially, we never
got any photographs

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of the enemy helicopters
or unidentified aircraft.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
We picked them up on radar.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
We tried to make
every attempt we could

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:90%
to get photographs of them.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
But on June 30, 1968,
there was a meeting

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:90%
held at MACV headquarters.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The subject was the
unidentified flying objects,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:84%
not enemy helicopters or
unidentified aircraft but UFOs,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Unidentified Flying
Objects, that

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
was being observed there
in Vietnam and as to what

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:90%
we should do about them.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
The decision from that meeting
would determine whether when

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
we came across UFOs, would
we engage them with fire

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:90%
to try to bring them down?

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It was determined that
if the UFOs did not

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
show any type of
a hostile action

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
toward us, that we
would not shoot at them.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
We would make attempt,
the special aircraft,

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
to try to make or take
photographs of them.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
To date, the meeting itself,
the minutes of the meeting,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and the conclusions
reached there

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and the recommendations
are still classified.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.027 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that unit
still in existence today?

00:09:18.027 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: I think it is.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:90%
The US government says it isn't.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:90%
But yes, I think it is.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
much more expanded.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not just members
of the US Army anymore.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I think we have members of the
US Navy and the US Air Force.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And the-- contrary to popular
belief, the United States Navy

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
plays a much larger role in
this than the other branches

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:90%
of service.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Why that is, I
have no knowledge.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what other devices
and manufacturing tools

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:84%
have we gained from this
extraterrestrial technology?

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Some of
the things that--

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
the fibers that lock, the
Kevlar that's bulletproof.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, like
the fiber optics--

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:90%
what we have is very earthly.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But we got it by
exploiting the technology

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:90%
we got off these craft.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And the situation is
it didn't end there.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.713 align:middle line:84%
As a result of this
unit, some of the things

00:10:17.713 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that came into
play, they realized

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:84%
that they had to go
ahead and get this

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
but make it look like it was
really part of the intelligence

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
community doing their job and
making sure that never ever

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
again after Pearl Harbor would
the United States ever be

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
a victim of technological
surprise in a war.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So we formulated to where
we had the project--

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Project Moon Dust set up.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Then we also had
Operation Blue Fly.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Project Moon Dust was
the overall program

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to recover only two items,
objects of non-US origin

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that survived reentry into
the Earth's atmosphere,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, we could
gather technical intelligence

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:90%
from that object.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
We would also-- if we found that
they had advanced technology

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that we might be
interested in, we

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
could exploit that
advanced technology.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:84%
In the objects that survived
reentry into the US atmosphere,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:90%
it was very earthly.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Very seldom did we find
the advanced technology.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, we would scare
the daylights out of Congress

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
because the military would
always go ahead and say,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
the Russians are way
ahead of us on this.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The Russians are way
ahead of us on that.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.282 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you from the
documents that I retrieved,

00:11:44.282 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that was just to
get more money out

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
of Congress, by scaring
the daylights out of them.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Fly, they were
the actual recovery teams

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that went out and did the
recovery of these objects,

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
pretty much like the
aftermath of this right here.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the situation
is that now, they

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
were bringing back
objects of non-US origin,

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:90%
of non-origin of any planet.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And we were exploiting
that technology.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.917 align:middle line:90%
And we made headway.

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, take a look.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Of all the advantages
since the Second World

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
War to present day,
we have actually

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
progressed technologically
almost 200 years ahead

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.598 align:middle line:84%
of our time technologically
as to where we should be now.

00:12:38.598 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Horse and
buggy to the Moon.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: Absolutely.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And the whole situation is
here, it was Kennedy said,

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
"By the end of this decade,
we are going to the Moon,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
not because it is easy,
because it is hard."

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, with that being
said, Kennedy knew.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But he was killed before he
had a chance to get it out.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was going to make
it clear we're going to do it.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:84%
NASA, who wasn't privy
to all this information,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:84%
was doing their own little thing
to get at-- with the Apollo

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
project to get us to the Moon
and get our people back safely.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
The United States
Army in the late 1950s

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:84%
was working on a program to
where we would have a band

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:90%
expedition to the Moon by 1960.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:84%
They were also planning
to have a 12-man Moon

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:84%
base, permanent Moon base,
by 1963, June of 1963.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:84%
We also knew that our
weapons here on Earth

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
would not work on the Moon as
effectively as they work here

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So we went ahead
and we developed--

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
once again, the
United States Army--

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
we developed
weapons systems that

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
would be very effective
against any enemy we

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:90%
might find on the Moon.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And the documents that
are talking about this

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
made it clear that if it was
Soviet troops or something

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of this sounds like
hooey you pull out of the air

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:90%
or from science fiction movies.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking to
you about right now

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:84%
are documents most American
people do not even know exist.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And this technology
wasn't a dream.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:90%
It existed.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Before the Russians got
their satellite, Sputnik--

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Sputnik I, October
the 4th, 1957,

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.080 align:middle line:84%
before they got it out in
space, the United States Army

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
launched a missile,
a rocket, that

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
went out 5,000 miles out in
space and came back to Earth.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, who got upset and
angry when they found out

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:84%
this happened and we let the
Russians get that satellite

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:90%
up there before us?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:84%
None other than, at the time,
Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
because now he knew that
we had the technology

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
to put a satellite up there
before the Russians did.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
In reality, we probably
had a satellite up there

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
before the Russians
put Sputnik up there.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And that would have been
as a result of the National

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Reconnaissance Organization.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: NRO.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.357 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: They went ahead.

00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They were working on satellites
before NASA came into being.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
When NASA went ahead and
started their program

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
to work on Apollo, they had
to find a site on the Moon.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to go ahead and
send a craft around the Moon,

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:90%
taking photographs.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Only they did not have
a good enough camera

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that would take the
high-resolution photographs

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:90%
they needed.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The NRO gave them
a camera, which

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.713 align:middle line:84%
was part of their old
technology, and said,

00:16:10.713 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
well, you know,
we developed this.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You try it and see
if it works for you.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
They put less than
$200,000 on that camera

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and came up with a camera
that was really good--

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:90%
took high-resolution pictures.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
That was the antiquated
technology of the NRO.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
The NRO at the time
had a camera that

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
did far better resolution than
that camera would have done.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But here again, if
they'd given it to NASA,

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that would possibly be a gapping
wound in the side of the NRO

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to let them know
that it existed.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
As it was, the NRO came into
existence back in the late

00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
'50s, became official in 1962,
and would not be known by most

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:84%
members of Congress or
anyone else until 19--

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:90%
1992.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
break down for us

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
the United States Army
Interplanetary Research

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.918 align:middle line:90%
Phenomena Unit?

00:17:14.918 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Well, the only
thing I can really point out

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
is that it was originally
started by General Douglas

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:90%
MacArthur, because he now knew.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And he shared this information,
and there were already

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:90%
other people that knew.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And I would suggest--

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for a
fact, but I would

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:84%
suggest the people were
handpicked by, at the time,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
the director of
Central Intelligence,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
simply because everyone thinks
the Air Force had control

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very quiet
that it was the CIA's Office

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:84%
of Scientific Intelligence that
actually had control over the--

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:90%
the entire UFO situation.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It was from that office that
the Air Force was directed

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:90%
to downplay the UFO phenomena.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Even when they did
the Project Blue Book,

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:90%
established it in 1948--

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
December 1948, December
10, 1948-- the Air Force

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.410 align:middle line:84%
released a report that would
remain classified until 1985.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And that report was Air
Intelligence Report 203.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And the Office of
Naval Intelligence

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:90%
played a role in that, also.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, the estimate
of the situation

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:84%
was already done and sent
for General Hoyt Vandenberg,

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
went and chastised
Air Intelligence.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that even the
Office of Naval Intelligence

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:90%
was involved there.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But here again, Air Intelligence
was the chief orchestrator.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
They did the estimate
of the situation.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Situation-- UFOs estimate.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Some UFOs were interplanetary.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Hoyt Vandenberg said,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the physical
evidence-- keyword,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.710 align:middle line:90%
"physical"--

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
to prove this.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you cannot
come to that conclusion.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:90%
So the report was--

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and you know you
don't do it this way--

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
ordered destroyed.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%
And no copies were to be kept.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you somewheres
in the archives,

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
there is one copy
of that report.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The reason I state that,
Air Intelligence Report

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
203 concluded that
some UFOs were real.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
They were exhibiting
highly advanced technology,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:90%
and we needed to find out more.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
The reason we needed
to find out more,

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
that technology could
be a technology that

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:90%
had been developed by the--

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:90%
by the former Soviet states.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And once again, the
hierarchy of the Air Force

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
came in, said,
gee, this report--

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
this was when it was
asked to be declassified--

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:90%
came in.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Don't declassify it.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
This report alludes to things
that the Air Force has never

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:84%
ever made public that
they might even believe.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
They ordered all copies
of that report destroyed.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And the situation is a little
snowflake in-- a little message

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%
sheet that made it clear.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
All copies of this report
has been destroyed,

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
with the exception
of one copy that

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:90%
is being kept for prosperity.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And that surfaced
from the archives,

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and I think it
was March of 1985.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.588 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what are they
doing today hands-on with this?

00:20:33.588 --> 00:20:35.255 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Well, the
whole situation is

00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
is that Moon Dust, which once
again was the overall recovery

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
of objects of non-US
origin survives reentry

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.800 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth's atmosphere and
objects of unknown origin, that

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:90%
exists to this day.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:84%
They're going to deny it,
but it exists to this day.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:84%
When the name was
compromised in 1985,

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
they went ahead and
changed the name.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: To what?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: We don't know.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.598 align:middle line:84%
I wish I did know,
because then I'd

00:21:00.598 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
be going after the documents
with-- under that name.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.088 align:middle line:90%
Blue Fly is the same thing.

00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But they always tried to
downplay it and blame it

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:90%
on the Russians.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Blame it on the Russians.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that
some of the documentation

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
surfaced that has made it clear.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, it was in 1963,
I think, that in the Sudan,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:29.713 align:middle line:84%
we recovered a satellite that
weighed something like six

00:21:29.713 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:90%
tons or something like that.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:84%
No satellite weighed
that much at that time.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
That-- with a lot
of difficulty, we

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:84%
cut a couple pieces
of that satellite

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
off to send-- to forward
it on to laboratories

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
here in the United States to
try to determine the material it

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
was made out of, while all
the time, we're saying,

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:90%
it seems to be made of aluminum.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Aluminum's hard to cut.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:90%
What happened to that satellite?

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And was that
a satellite or a craft?

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: I think
it was a craft.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
a satellite at all.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I believe so, too.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.097 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: The
whole situation is

00:22:07.097 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:84%
is that they could come
out and tell us who

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and what the name of that
six-ton satellite was.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Who-- who put it out there?

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Who made it?

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.440 align:middle line:90%
For what purpose was it?

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And to date, that's
not happened.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.812 align:middle line:84%
But the programs
are still going on.

00:22:28.812 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
three-letter agencies

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:90%
are involved with this?

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And where's the
information going?

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Every agency in
the United States government

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:90%
is gathering this type of data.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Within each agency, they
have a special office

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that reports directly back
to the Central Intelligence

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Agency's Office of
Scientific Intelligence.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
The Office of
Scientific Intelligence

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:84%
reports directly to the director
of Central Intelligence,

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
the Central Intelligence Agency.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But that being said, the Central
Intelligence-- the director

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA is answerable only
to the President of the United

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, the scary part--

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:84%
the director of the Central
Intelligence Agency,

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:84%
while he has to keep
quiet about all this,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even necessarily
have to report back

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:84%
to the President of the United
States, that temporary resident

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
of the White House, as to
what's all behind this.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So does the president
know what's going on?

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And is he the only person that
knows, besides these agencies?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: The director
of Central Intelligence

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:90%
knows what's going on.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
He does not-- he's
not required to brief

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:90%
the president on any of this.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Many presidents have
asked, and many presidents

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:84%
have been denied
that information.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you see that as a
threat to the American people

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and to the world?

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: Absolutely .

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I see that as a big-time threat.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:90%
This is supposed to be--

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, we call
it a democracy.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:90%
We're a republic.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Democracy is where anything
and everything that goes on,

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:90%
everyone votes on it.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:90%
We're too lazy to do that.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we elect members
of Congress, the members of--

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Senate and House
of Representatives.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're saying
they're handpicked?

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:90%
These individuals?

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: The people who know?

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.928 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: They're
handpicked, and they're not

00:24:19.928 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:90%
even elected officials.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
When we have a UFO that
we're going out to recover,

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:84%
we have a group of
people that meet

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
what they call "the situation
room" there at the White House.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Normally, that would be the
National Security Council.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is a hand-select
people who are directly,

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
for a lifetime, associated
with being in the know as

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on with UFOs.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:90%
They are there.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The people in the country
where the UFO went down,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
if it's a foreign country,
they're at the embassy.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
They have a group of people
there known as the "country

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
team," who's coordinating with
the equivalent of whatever it's

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:84%
called nowadays, the Blue Fly
team and the country in which

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:84%
they're in, telling
them, you know,

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
if this is a foreign
power, we need

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to help you identify who
that foreign power is

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
so we can give it back
to them as required

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:90%
by international law.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, we get that.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, there's
no foreign identity.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:90%
So we keep it.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you yourself know
any of these individuals?

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.612 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: I don't
want to get you killed.

00:25:31.612 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
If I was to name even who I
might suspect and I hit it,

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:90%
it can--

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.643 align:middle line:90%
it could-- it could cost lives.

00:25:43.643 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Am I trying to get
the information

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
where I can go ahead and say,
here's the document that names

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:84%
who they are and shows
that we recovered craft

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:90%
from other planets?

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.875 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Then I'm not
as afraid, as concerned.

00:25:57.875 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because you have
that for validation, yes.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.958 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: Absolutely.

00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I got it legally through the
Freedom of Information Act.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:84%
My major concern is that
these people are not even

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:84%
elected officials or even
members of the United States

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
government-- no way,
shape, form, or fashion.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:84%
They are from
major corporations.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And these major
corporations may have

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
ties with foreign
governments that

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
have interests other than
the same interests that we

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:90%
might have.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
foreign entities

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that are tied to
these corporations

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
may be the ones that
are actually in power.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And we don't even know this.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So the whole situation is it
makes for a very scary, very

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.655 align:middle line:90%
dangerous type situation.

00:26:40.655 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Sergeant
Stone, were you

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
a member of either
one of these projects?

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: No,
these were actually

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
under the demise of the
United States Air Force.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But-- but that being said,
there were interservice assets

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
that would be brought in
for specific purposes.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Like with me, I was what
they called an "Interfacer."

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even to know that
Moon Dust even existed or Blue

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.835 align:middle line:90%
Fly even existed.

00:27:10.835 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:84%
They would have
a three-man team,

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they
were made up of.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But they could draw
on the resources

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of the other military
installations

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.390 align:middle line:84%
in the area to accomplish
the mission that they

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:90%
had to accomplish.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And on top of that--
correct me if I'm wrong.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.200 align:middle line:84%
What about your
classification, because you

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
were part of something
but didn't even know you

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.237 align:middle line:84%
had the classification to
actually be part of that?

00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: That was
the scariest part of it

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
all, because the whole situation
is that most of the times

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:84%
when you went in,
you received what

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:90%
they called an "in briefing."

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
When you left, you received what
was called an "out briefing."

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you left and you
got that out briefing,

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.765 align:middle line:84%
you signed what was called
a "nondisclosure statement."

00:27:57.765 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the only time
you're supposed to get these

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is when the mission's classified
and you have the classification

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to be knowledgeable
of that information.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I thought, gee, I don't
have a security clearance.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't be until
they tried to court martial

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
me because I shooting
off my big mouth,

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
not following
orders given to me,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that I was no longer
to talk about UFOs.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I was not to talk to the media.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I was not to write to government
organizations about UFOs.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.278 align:middle line:84%
Nor was I to write to
members of Congress

00:28:39.278 --> 00:28:41.195 align:middle line:84%
or even to the President
of the United States.

00:28:41.195 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I consider that
an illegal order,

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and I continued to
do what I was doing.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's explain
to everyone for us

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.040 align:middle line:84%
how is the military working
together on these projects.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Or are they fighting over
these crafts and devices?

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Well, in this
particular situation dealing

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
with UFOs, there is
absolutely positively

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:90%
no interservice rivalry over it.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
The information
is being gathered

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
to glean the
technology involved,

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:84%
to exploit that technology,
that advanced technology.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:84%
But with the Air
Force being in charge

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:84%
of the units that are
actually involved, going back

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
to that Air Intelligence
Service unit that's

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
there at Fort Belvoir, from
there, it goes on to the--

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
they could go through, not
necessarily having have to--

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force Office of
Scientific Intelligence,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
because that's a direct
tie-in to the CIA's

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Office of Scientific
Intelligence,

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.870 align:middle line:84%
which from there, they make
the decision where it goes.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.810 align:middle line:84%
From there, that's
the black hole.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea where
they send it out to.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I do know that it goes through
R&D. After the military R&D,

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
we go over-- we were
able to discover this,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:90%
but we can't do no more with it.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Civilian indux-- our
civilian industrial,

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.540 align:middle line:84%
can you go ahead and
do something with it?

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Higher universities.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And who chooses that?

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.935 align:middle line:84%
Is it just the
director of the CIA,

00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:23.560 align:middle line:84%
because obviously, the president
doesn't know this is going on.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.977 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: There--
there's a team

00:30:24.977 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:84%
that decides to
do that that works

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.690 align:middle line:84%
with the director of
Central Intelligence.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the key drawbacks
there which they're not always

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:90%
briefed is in fact that--

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that of the Air
Intelligence-- or I'm

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- of the Intelligence
Advisory Committee, which

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:84%
in 1952 actually won there
would be a stronger stance taken

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.450 align:middle line:84%
against UFOs, up to and
including the point where

00:30:53.450 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the National Security Council
would be advised about UFOs

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and issue what's called a
"National Security Council

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:84%
intelligence
directive," which would

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:84%
have gotten the
entire intelligence

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:90%
community involved.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that, the
Intelligence Advisory Committee

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
felt that the time
involved to identify

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.630 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena, the unidentified
flying object, wherever

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.430 align:middle line:90%
it was seen may take weeks.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.870 align:middle line:90%
That's too long.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
By that time, you can
have atomic devices

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:90%
dropped on your country.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that technical surprise

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
coming to you, you could
lose the war before you ever

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.160 align:middle line:90%
got involved in it.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.140 align:middle line:84%
They want rapid, quick
identification of the object.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to have in
place the capability

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:84%
to neutralize any threat that
might be associated with it.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.430 align:middle line:84%
This was the one
thing they wanted.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The CIA wanted to go
ahead and downplay it.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
The CIA had the Air Force
go ahead with the stance

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:90%
that there's nothing to UFOs.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.450 align:middle line:90%
It was the CIA.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:14.010 align:middle line:84%
It went back and told the Air
Force that, you know what?

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Right now, Blue Book,
they have 20% unknowns.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.550 align:middle line:84%
You need to produce or
to reduce that number.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
In time, they
reduced it to 7.7%.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Which is still a lot.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.105 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: Oh, yeah.

00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's also a lie--

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes--

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Because
the way we reduced it,

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
we went ahead with the
possible and probable

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
meteorological explanations,
misidentification,

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.050 align:middle line:84%
possible/probable
civilian and/or military.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A bunch of fluff.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: After about
six, seven months,

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that possible or
probable became gone.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it was,
even though we knew better.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Then the situation with
the NRO, the Air Force

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.730 align:middle line:84%
went ahead and, like
most of us today,

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:84%
decided it has to be these
highly classified programs

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:90%
the NRO is working with.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So have you
contributed to this program

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
specifically directly
or indirectly?

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.005 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: Reluctantly,
I attributed to it.

00:33:17.005 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In what way?

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD: In the
fact that interfacing,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.010 align:middle line:84%
where you're the one carrying
on the talk with the visitor

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:25.890 align:middle line:90%
or who--

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.932 align:middle line:90%
whomever they have there.

00:33:26.932 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Also picking up-- and
I'm ready to use the term

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.630 align:middle line:84%
"psychically" on
some of the things

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that's going on in
that particular area,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
because they tune you
in that our visitors,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:84%
when they decided to use you
to follow you throughout life,

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.700 align:middle line:84%
you now was a learning
tool for our visitors.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:84%
You live a life, and they
learn from that life.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But the situation
is the military

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:90%
knows you have this ability.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
use that ability.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Normally, they would
try to get you--

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.520 align:middle line:90%
in my case-- the Air Force.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite sure most
of these people, that's

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:90%
where they'd want them to go.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:90%
I had medical problems.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed to
go in the military.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But they assumed
that they'd somehow

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:90%
get me in the Air Force.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So my duty form
for it initially,

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:84%
which was to work
against me later on

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
to help them, they
went ahead and put down

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that I enlisted in the
United States Air Force,

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:90%
because that was the goal.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But by virtue of
everything going on,

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I had to go into the
United States Army.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't have
no problems till they

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:84%
decided that I'm being brought
into the fold, so to speak.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And they needed me to
stay in the military,

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.679 align:middle line:84%
and I only had a little
more than a year left.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.957 align:middle line:84%
So we want you to reenlist
for three more years.

00:34:53.957 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if you don't
do that, we're going to court

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:57.748 align:middle line:84%
martial you because
you're supposed

00:34:57.748 --> 00:34:59.600 align:middle line:90%
to be in the Air Force.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.200 align:middle line:90%
So I was a 19-year-old kid.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I was scared to death.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're
twisting your arm.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.447 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: That's it.

00:35:04.447 --> 00:35:05.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll go for it.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And the whole situation is
is that they cannot train--

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.810 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing, we can
go ahead and train that.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And people who think that
we ended that program,

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.830 align:middle line:90%
they're full of hooey.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:84%
We still are working on that
program, the remote viewing.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It was much more
effective than what

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:84%
we told the public to try
to cover it up and keep it

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.570 align:middle line:90%
from Congress.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:84%
When they found
out about MK Ultra,

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.160 align:middle line:84%
the CIA destroyed
thousands of documents.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:41.270 align:middle line:84%
To keep them from falling
into the hands of members

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:90%
of Congress.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because then they
would cut their budget.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: They would.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:48.853 align:middle line:84%
But the whole situation is what
a lot of people don't know,

00:35:48.853 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:84%
even when it comes to the UFO
programs-- and there's more,

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:55.030 align:middle line:84%
which I don't even
know or understand--

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.090 align:middle line:90%
these are black funded.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.270 align:middle line:90%
They are money that is taken.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The money is accounted
for, that hey,

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
we're putting this $100,000
into a black funded project.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.943 align:middle line:90%
They don't name it.

00:36:09.943 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:84%
They may have two or
three members of Congress

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to go in and talk to the
other members, saying, look,

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:84%
we can't tell you
anything about it.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's necessary
and important that we

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:24.370 align:middle line:84%
keep it, that we finance this
program and make sure it works.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And that happens every year.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The NRO still gets a whole
lot of black funded projects.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Fascinating
information.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Sergeant
Stone, for joining us.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:36.778 align:middle line:90%
>>CLIFFORD: My pleasure, sir.

00:36:36.778 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
