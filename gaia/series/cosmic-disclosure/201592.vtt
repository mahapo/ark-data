00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:21.340 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:10%
we are with Dr. Robert Wood.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.097 align:middle line:10%
He's a retired
aerospace engineer

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:10%
who has worked on everything
from the Ballistics Missile

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:10%
Defense to the space station.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:10%
But more recently,
Bob is the editor

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:10%
of a new book on
William Tompkins called

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:10%
"Selected by
Extraterrestrials, Volume 2--

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:10%
My Life in the Top
Secret World of UFOs,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:10%
Think Tanks, and
Nordic Secretaries."

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.898 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to the show.

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT WOOD: Thank you.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, many people
remember when they were young,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
having an out-of-body
experience,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
like when they're lying in
bed or kind of in a dream

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
state, hypnagogic state, or
floating or flying around,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:90%
usually at night.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like
we're separating

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:90%
from the physical body.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And I know Bill
Tompkins mentions this.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:90%
And what does he mean by that?

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, he reported--
he typed it himself--

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.838 align:middle line:84%
that when he was growing up,
was able to do remote viewing.

00:01:15.838 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's what they
would call it when you're

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:90%
floating around, looking down.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Later on when he became
involved with the Nordics

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
through the secretaries
and understood

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
there was a Nordic
race, he claimed

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that he was able to
actually go to their planet

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and see them remote
viewing and said

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
that it was a very peaceful,
modern, stable society.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he would sit down,
remote view this, possibly

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:84%
astral project, and bring
back this information

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and make decisions on
his life with this?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.515 align:middle line:84%
And he took it very
seriously, it seems.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Yeah, that
seems to be the case.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the content that
we talked about rarely

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
included his discussions of
personally remote viewing.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
But he did talk about the
psychic communication.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of different
from taking your mind

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and going somewhere
as opposed to just

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
having his Nordic secretaries
give him ideas through two

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:90%
different functions.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: And I think the
distinction is important.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, let's look at
this clip from William Tompkins

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:90%
about astral projection.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM TOMPKINS:
When I was just a boy

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:10%
and I was seven, eight, nine
years old, I used to fly a lot.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, I didn't have an airplane.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I just flew.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:90%
We were living in Santa Monica.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:90%
We were living in Hollywood.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And I flew a lot,
mostly at night.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:10%
But a couple of times
in class, in school,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:10%
recess, I'd just go behind the--

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:10%
I'd go behind the building,
and I took a flight.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I'd put my
arms out, but most of the time

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
might, I'd just go out.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I could fly all over
Hollywood, San Fernando Valley,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
go down to the beach in Santa
Monica, fly up to Malibu,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
fly all the way
down to San Pedro,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
look at the Navy ships and
the dry docks in San Pedro

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and fly over LAX and come back.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time
flying over LAX.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
of stuff going on,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
so I kept myself away from the
airports as much as I could.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:10%
A few times, I would-- after
I'd had fun just flying around,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:10%
looking--

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:10%
particularly, it was more
fun at night with the lights.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I'd just shoot out,
out into the galaxy.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And I flew way above
186,000 miles a second--

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:90%
way, way above that.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And it took
everybody a long time

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:84%
to figure out that even the
Germans could fly faster

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
than that, and certainly
the extraterrestrials could.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But what I am saying I
do is I fly out there.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And one time, I flew into--

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
it was the admiral's command
ship of a reptilian space navy.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:10%
I flew right into his office.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:10%
I could see, hear,
and smell everything

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:10%
that they were saying.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:10%
To me, it came to me in
English, just like when

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:10%
I flew one time over Russia.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And Sergey Gorshkov had
been building a whole series

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:84%
of futuristic ships
that don't even

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
look like they're
from the planet

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
because they were
built with stealth.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I flew over the base,
Vladivostok base.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And I actually flew
around the base,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
went down, looked into the edges
of the construction facilities,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
came back up high, flew in
to Sergey Gorshkov's office.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And I could see, hear, and
smell the coffee in his office.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And his language--
which language--

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:90%
English.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
All of them were
talking English.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I actually got into a
research group in the Navy

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
where I was an advisor to
the psychic type of whatever

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing here.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can definitely
relate to that.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:10%
When I was very young,
around 6 to 10 years of age,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't wait
to meditate or go

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:10%
to sleep because you go up
and go wherever you want,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:10%
see whoever you want.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So what else could
you elaborate on

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.175 align:middle line:84%
that that he had
shared with you?

00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, I think
this particular video

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
is particularly important
to me because even though we

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
had become very familiar,
close to each other,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
what he described about his
early years of going away we

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:90%
never personally talked about.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
But where he talked about
the Gorshkov interview,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:84%
that is highly relevant
in the second book.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that's
especially important

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is that that particular
specific remote viewing

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.625 align:middle line:84%
event was accompanied
with two other people.

00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:84%
There's Bobby Ray Inman, who
was there at the same time

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:90%
doing the same thing.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And the words that were said
are consistent with what

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
he said about smelling
the coffee and all that,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and the fact they
were talking English.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:84%
These were remarkable
to me because we

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:84%
had more than one remote
viewer at the same place

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
having the same story.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but the story was

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:84%
relevant to a military
issue because they

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:90%
were redesigning their ships.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't understand why.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
this remote viewing

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
gave them an important hint
to that redesign process.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, absolutely.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:10%
And we've been trained to meet
in secret places on purpose

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:10%
to have private
conversations and exchange

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:10%
information with
other remote viewers

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:10%
and other people
of high authority

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:10%
that were able to do this.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my colleagues are
very well trained in this.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I remember many
times in CSETI, I'd

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.487 align:middle line:84%
be meeting with
the board members.

00:08:12.487 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, hey, we'll meet
at the top the pyramid.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.445 align:middle line:84%
We'll meet at the other
side behind the moon.

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
We'll meet in the
eye of Jupiter.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And when everyone is
on that same frequency,

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.270 align:middle line:84%
that same level, it's
a beautiful thing

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because you're
actually communicating.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Even if they don't know the
same language, like he says,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you're still hearing it in a
way that you can understand.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's emotion
involved with that.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
All your senses
are still active,

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:90%
and it's recorded somehow.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I love that he talks
about the smell

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:90%
of the coffee or the incense.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:90%
This is real stuff.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can do this if
they're trained properly.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So it really, for me, is a
very in-depth, serious thing

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:90%
because we still do it.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And anyone can do it.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, while I
initially was skeptical

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of these concepts, as I've
learned more and more and more,

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm totally satisfied
that this is just

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:90%
as real as you describe.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I have never decided to take
the energy on my own time

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to attempt to be good at it.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And the one time I was
trying, I was not good.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I went to a spoon bending event
and could not bend the spoon.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
My son, on the other hand,
is pretty good at it.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And he seems to be able to
get information that way.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm totally confident
of what you're saying

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and what Bill is
saying that this

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is a real thing and the report
that he had about viewing

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Gorshkov was a very real thing.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was done for military
reasons, and it worked.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:84%
There are facilities on the moon
that a lot of the governments

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
use to have meeting places,
just in a safe remote view

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:84%
area on the inner
part of the moon.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the moon is something
that various researchers

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and scientists have
discussed in terms

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of it being natural
versus something

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:90%
that was created by technology.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Bob, has Bill ever spoke to
you about targeting the moon

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:90%
as a place for remote viewing?

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: He would tell me about
his experiences of his life.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And once in a while,
remote viewing

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:84%
would be involved,
as we discussed.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But when he told
me about the moon,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
he didn't say he got
it from remote viewing.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:84%
He just told me factually--
he said, oh, by the way,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
the moon is hollow,
and it's not ours.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And somebody else put it up.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.953 align:middle line:84%
And these things I
had heard before.

00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It seems to go back
and forth with the scientists

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and researchers saying the
moon is real, the moon is fake.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
We have a great video here
with Bill talking about that.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Well, first of
all, it's not your moon.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And secondly, it's not a moon.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a command center
for a region of this part

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't rotate.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody forgets the
thing doesn't turn.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a moon.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not your moon.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a command center
with probably 25 to 35

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
different civilizations
in there, all of which

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
operate out here for this
part of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And yes, some of
those people actually

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
are at war with
each other, but they

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:90%
have personnel living here.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Their families live here.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Their kids are getting educated.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:90%
They get young.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
They get older.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:90%
They get married and marry.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a big-- it's
a big facility.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, his
conversations about the moon

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:90%
sort of surprised me.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I had heard rumors that the
moon might have been artificial

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
in the past, but it wasn't
until he came right out

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and said it that I
started to pay attention.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.558 align:middle line:84%
I asked myself the question,
well, how could that be?

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought of the fact--
well, the moon and the Earth

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:84%
rotate in a common
center of gravity,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
so clearly we can figure out
what the density of the moon

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:90%
is because we know its size.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:90%
We know its mass.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And that means you should
be able to show simply,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to anybody who is interested,
that the moon is partly hollow.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen any of
the conventional astronomical

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
organizations actually do
that or make that point, which

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.945 align:middle line:90%
is surprising to me.

00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That is
very surprising.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:10%
Did he ever talk about
the actual beings there,

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:10%
the different races?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:10%
Did he get into a
detail of who they were

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.965 align:middle line:10%
and where they came from?

00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT: No.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Remember, what we have
in the first two books

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:90%
are from what he typed down.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't type everything.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But he did make it clear
that the moon was hollow.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And he made the point
that he made in the video

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that it's unlikely
that it is exactly

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
the right position in exactly
the right rotation rate for it

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to be where it is
so that we can't

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.700 align:middle line:90%
see the backside of the moon.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And that happens to be
at the exact distance

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:90%
where you get an eclipse.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where do you think
Bill got this information from?

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Was it the Germans?

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Was it from working at TRW?

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, Bill got a lot
of information about the Nazis

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.935 align:middle line:90%
from various sources.

00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure that I
thought about all the sources.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was clear to
me that the statements

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
about the Nazis having
the capability in 1942

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
to put the first man, a German
Navy commander, on the moon

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
is very true, very
likely to be true.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall that
that's in Bill's book.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But because of this question
about the moon being occupied,

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
it caused me to read some other
literature on the subject.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to the
personal conclusion

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that that's a true report,
that the Germans actually

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:90%
did have a guy on the moon.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They were the first
Earthlings to be on the moon?

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT: Yeah, right, in '42.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the corollaries

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to that in the context of
the secret space program

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
is they might well have
been the first people

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to go to Mars with a group
that couldn't make it in.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:90%
They died.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But that's not anything
that Bill and I ever

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:90%
talked about in detail.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm really not sure I can
answer the question of where

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Bill got his information
about the people on the moon.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:84%
He alluded to a couple
of dozen or 30 or so

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that were in
harmony with each other.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
That's not anything that he
and I personally talked about

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:90%
that I can remember.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Bill mentioned on the
video that it's not your moon.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say it's not our moon.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.627 align:middle line:90%
So who is he directing that at?

00:15:01.627 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: I think that's
a really interesting sort

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:90%
of question.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%
That's one I've thought of.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly
true that that's

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.767 align:middle line:84%
what he said is that
it's not our moon.

00:15:10.767 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Maybe he's talking
about the human civilization

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: I think
the fact that there

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
are civilizations on Earth
was always in his mind,

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
whereas he did not have a
great focus on civilizations

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.600 align:middle line:84%
that were thousands of years old
that may still be living here.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, he accepted that
he wanted to really understand

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
the relationship to today's
world, the World War II,

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and what might be next.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And how could we explore
the nearest stars?

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
He wanted, really, to
do these explorations.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.057 align:middle line:84%
And then emotionally, he
wanted to stop the slavery.

00:15:52.057 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know of
anything with the Germans?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Have they been back?

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to
create anything there?

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT: Bill died in 2017.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And we were beginning to
talk about the kind of things

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are
talking about now.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that I
would have learned if he

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.648 align:middle line:90%
had been able to live longer.

00:16:15.648 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well it's kind
of like-- you know,

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:90%
he said it's not your moon.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, where do
we stand in the galaxy?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:90%
What is our place in the galaxy?

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And we do have a clip on
him talking about that.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: We've now accepted
that we have 200 trillion

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:90%
galaxies--

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:90%
not million.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We have 200 trillion
galaxies out there.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are so naive
of what's out there.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:90%
It's totally unbelievable.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:10%
Millions and millions
of planets out there,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:10%
very small things and
things that make our star

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:10%
look like kid stuff.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:10%
Our star is just a little
dot over on the side, even

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:10%
our galaxy.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
And while we're
talking about that,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
this subject comes
up all the time,

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's an appropriate
time to say it.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
If we can visualize us as
the center of the Milky Way

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:90%
galaxy--

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:84%
we're reaching out
like this with our arm.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in this room and
all the audience that's

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:84%
going to be watching
this has to realize

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the arms
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:55.055 align:middle line:84%
You're located at
my first joint.

00:17:55.055 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:90%
You're not-- wait a minute.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
You're not down
where the action is.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Milky Way
galaxy, you're not downtown

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
where all the action is.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
You are out here at this
tip, which in time, you're

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
going to get thrown off
because the galaxy rotates.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:90%
The galaxy rotates.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:90%
All of them do.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:90%
They rotate.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:90%
So the tips get thrown off.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Other galaxies come by, and
they pick up that stuff.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So you may be going to the next
galaxy several weeks from now.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:90%
It takes quite a while.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So to realize that
you're not downtown,

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
you're just one
of the castoffs--

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
this little solar system
thing that you've got here,

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:90%
you're out in the boonies.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that we
have to address who we are,

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
where we are, and what we know
and realize that the universe

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
is unbelievable.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And so opportunities for young
people in this country and all

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:84%
over the world to be involved
in this commercially--

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:90%
come on.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Forget about carrying a big gun.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:90%
There's too much of that.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
That's not the right step.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have the largest
enough to be able to stop it.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the Navy has
been saying this for 240 years.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
If you have a large enough
navy, they'll back off.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
use a shooting navy.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
carry that, people

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to really
make it hard for you.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, I think
we're just starting.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
We've just got the tip of the
iceberg of where we can go

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:90%
and what we can do.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's unbelievable
opportunities.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Unprecedented
statement.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell
us more about that?

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, I'll
give you a little bit

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
of my reaction to the fact that
he said there were so many more

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:84%
galaxies, and then he talked
about the details of the Milky

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Way and that we were just
one small part of one

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:90%
arm of the Milky Way.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
try to relate this

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
to the number of civilizations
and where they come from,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:90%
it gets a little bit bigger.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
many civilizations.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Bill kept
talking about the fact

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
that there were millions of
other galaxies is important.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure
that he is claiming

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that the civilizations that
we're encountering all the time

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
are from this galaxy
or intergalactic.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's a mystery in terms
of what he really believed.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
He implied that intergalactic
travel is a routine thing.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
specific civilizations that

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
might have been here, the 160
or so, and ask where they are,

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about maybe
1,000 light years away, which

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
is trivial compared to the
size of the Milky Way, which

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:90%
is what--

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:90%
30,000--

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Very
comprehendible, yeah.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:21.983 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT: Yeah.

00:21:21.983 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Bill
mentioned we have

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:90%
to have this large navy fleet.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
have weapons on it,

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:90%
but we do need a big presence.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean by that?

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, Bill
is 100% a Navy guy.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's active
in the Navy League.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he used to go
to West, which in San Diego

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
was an annual event where
the Navy League people all

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:90%
get together.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But he also was
active when he went

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to Oregon, his later
years, in using

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the Navy League to train
kids to join the Navy

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
and understand UFOs.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So basically, he was
setting up a UFO training

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
group for kids as part of
the Navy League program.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And his vision was a big
navy can be a peaceful navy.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he was
encouraging these kids

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.615 align:middle line:90%
to learn more about UFOs--

00:22:14.615 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted
the whole thing

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to be peaceful and be for
the betterment of society.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So he was a recruiter.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT: Yeah.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A peaceful recruiter.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:10%
Bob, we're talking about
interstellar travel.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.660 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
just getting into space.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:10%
Do you think time travel
is necessary for that?

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:90%
What did Bill comment on that?

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, Bill and I used
to talk about at the crafts

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that we'd believed
that we'd made the,

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
TR3B, an Air Force
CIA craft, we thought.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I
concluded in my own mind

00:22:54.510 --> 00:23:01.178 align:middle line:84%
that you can't go 10,000 light
years at the speed of light.

00:23:01.178 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: On gas, coal, and oil.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: And going it
in a couple of weeks.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, there is some
sort of time involvement.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
we have figured out

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:90%
how that process works.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that-- in the
context of the Navy,

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that the early
recovery of a navy

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
craft at the Battle of LA
resulted in the Navy guys

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
giving out a portion
of how it worked.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
get this first craft up

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
in orbit by replacing
a nuclear power

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:84%
plant with an anti-gravity
power plant in the '80s.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think we
have operational vehicles now

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:90%
that are anti-gravity?

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever mention that?

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, the
cigars he and I understood

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to be the Navy's craft
for a solar warden that

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.512 align:middle line:90%
are anti-gravity.

00:23:55.512 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I never claimed to
be an expert on this

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
because as far as I
know, nobody claims

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:84%
to know how time
travel really works

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's really true.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But I'm confident
that there are people

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
who think they can
do it, and I believe

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that the so-called
reference to portals,

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
where you can pop into a portal
and go to Mars, those things

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:90%
are real.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And they involve some sort
of time-space interaction

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:90%
and impact time travel.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing that
they're real, that they

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:84%
will have been used by people
who have the right reason.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're under rigorous
control by somebody whose

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:84%
identity I cannot
state with confidence.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.103 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:24:50.103 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What would
be your guess?

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: My guess
is the whole process

00:24:53.470 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
for this is so compartmentalized
that it's only one group that

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
has control of the
portals and another group

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that has control
of the spacecraft,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and they don't necessarily
know the details of each other.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.792 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Multiple
corporations, organizations?

00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT: Yeah.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:84%
In terms of actually
implementing it,

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:90%
yeah, different corporations.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
that I learned from Bill

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
is that most of
the implementation

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:84%
is probably done in
huge, underground bases,

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
not on the surface
where anybody can

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:90%
see all this stuff being made.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Anything on the surface
is completely exposed by--

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
you know-- drones and
satellites and traffic cameras.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT: Right, right.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we could have a lot
of evil under the surface,

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:90%
and we probably do.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of these--
well, the reptilians

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and the Nazis in Antarctica
are a good example.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:84%
They are nearly all
bad, and they've

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
got some links with our
own corporations which

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:84%
are supporting things,
mining and slavery.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why is
the United Nations--

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
if you want to join the
United Nations as a country,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:84%
you have to sign a
treaty that you are not

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.652 align:middle line:90%
allowed to go to Antarctica.

00:26:08.652 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Do you know about that?

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: I didn't know
that specific requirement

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did Bill say
about who's actually leading?

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's part of the Navy.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.265 align:middle line:84%
Who is in control
this space force?

00:26:22.265 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well, he seemed to
make a big point of the fact

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
that TRW was ultimately
bought about 2000,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:90%
I think, by Grumman.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:10%
And he certainly alluded to
the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:10%
as a real thing.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But he never implied that these
corporations were necessarily,

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
quote, bad versus good,
that they were just

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:84%
building things under contract,
and the good and bad just kind

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.210 align:middle line:90%
of happened.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
He, I think, was
confident that the things

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that the Navy did and paid
for were all towards the good.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But he was biased
in that regard.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So multiple
corporations possibly

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:84%
even working together to
fulfill these military contracts

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and other organizational
contracts, I assume.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: Well yeah,
there's togetherness.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe that he
stated that some of the Area 51

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
activities involved the Russians
and Chinese now, these days.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing that is in
the book written down on that.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of other people

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:84%
who are discussing those
issues with respect

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to how multicultural Area
51 activities really are.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that Area 51 began
with the Germans helping us.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And we even have the names of
the people who were doing that.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating stuff.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bob, thanks for
being on the show,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and thanks for sharing
all of these amazing

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
experiences with
William Tompkins.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT: You asked
really good questions.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:10%
