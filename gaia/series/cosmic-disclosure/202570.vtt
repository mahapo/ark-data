>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're with Randy Cramer,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:10%
who claims to have participated
in a secret space program

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:10%
called The Earth Defense Force.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.188 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me, Emery.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Since you were last here, you
became aware of more advanced

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:90%
technology and craft.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:90%
How did you come about this?

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:90%
What was your intel from this?

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of that is from
my tour of service,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and I just have chosen at
different points to discuss

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
certain things at certain times
and to not overfill people with

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
too much information about
other parts of my career,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.352 align:middle line:84%
other aspects of technology or
craft that I have worked with.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But these are things that
I've experienced personally

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:90%
pretty much.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.367 align:middle line:84%
>> So you didn't get
it from a source.

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It was just something that
you were involved with?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
I have experienced,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
flown in these craft,
used this technology.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just we have
not focused on having

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
these conversations about that
aspect of my career because

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
of certain choices around
compartmentalization

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.365 align:middle line:84%
and whether it was appropriate
to discuss those things or not.

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What can you tell us about
some of the better weaponry

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.032 align:middle line:90%
that you've been involved with?

00:01:26.032 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the most advanced
technology that I've worked

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
with, the advances are
often in targeting.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So you have targeting systems
which can find targets

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:84%
around corners, through
solid objects, where

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:84%
it's less of the old school way,
which is using even advanced

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:84%
sighting, using your
eyeball to sight

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and then fire in
a straight line,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:84%
where there's a computer
system that tracks targets,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:90%
locks on to moving targets.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And so you can kind of hold
your hand way out here and pull

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:84%
the trigger, and the
projectiles will find their way

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
to the target, or the
weapon will automatically

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:84%
target at the target
that you're firing at.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, small
explosive projectiles

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that can be programmed to
explode in front of the target

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:90%
or behind the target.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases,
you have species

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
or different military
opponents that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
are very focused on front
armor or front shielding.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you blow up something,
you know, 12 inches

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
behind its head, it's
a lot more effective

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
than trying to blow it
up in front of its face.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
What I found interesting
is they've recently

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
come out within the last year
or two, some of the scientists

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:84%
in these TED Talks,
and they're talking

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.270 align:middle line:84%
about the exact
technology that we

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
were used to back in the day in
our compartmentalized projects

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
where they're measuring the
photons through the cameras.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So you can be entering this
building, OK, and that camera's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:84%
going to, number one, lay out
the whole building for you,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
because the photons are
reflecting back information.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you can get
biological information,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%
genetic information.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
If you actually have the genetic
marker for a specific target

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
in a crowd, you can use
the targeting system

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
to find the genetic target
that you're looking for.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking
for a bunch of-- looking

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
for a specific target in a
group of a similar species

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.483 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
physically identify,

00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
the targeting
system will tell you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
which biological target
has the genetic marker.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I was also exposed
to these things--

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:90%
they call them smart bullets.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know you probably
know what that is.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
How does that track,
and how does it

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
maneuver through the
building to get its target?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It's essentially
like a little, teeny,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:90%
mini rocket missile that can--

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
has a little gimbal
in the back so that it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:90%
can direct its direction.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So it can go around
corners, up staircases,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.675 align:middle line:90%
have a certain number of--

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:84%
a certain number of seconds that
it has controlled flight with,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.348 align:middle line:84%
so you have so many seconds
or so many hundreds of feet--

00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what they said.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
It was based on a distance
because of the propellant

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it's using.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know the actual
technical term for that,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.704 align:middle line:84%
but I have seen it
used in the projects.

00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
And I was always
wondering how it

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
was able to go around a turn,
because it's not going 3,000

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:90%
feet per second like a 223.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
It's doing a little bit
more of a maneuvering.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But it then picks
up speed at the end

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:90%
when it hits the target.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:90%
And-- yeah.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
In the last approach
to the target,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
it accelerates so it hits
the target even harder.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Are those also--
have explosives in them?

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
They come in a
variety of functions.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
There is a
armor-piercing hard point

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
that's just a solid
piece of metal

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:90%
with a propellant behind it.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
phosphorous rounds

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:90%
and you have explosive rounds.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there's-- basically you
have a little payload system,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and just about anything that
you could think could be used

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
as a payload in a
combat situation,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
you could outfit one
of these rounds for.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But mostly it's
either you've got

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
a plain, a hard-tipped
round, phosphorous round,

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:90%
and an exploding round.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the newest
ones I was debriefed on is

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
a low-velocity one that they
said can inoculate someone with

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- do you
know about this?

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, as I was
saying, the payload is variable,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and so the technology is not
that difficult to vary to--

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
yeah, something that you
could have a biological or--

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.615 align:middle line:84%
>> But you wouldn't even feel
it, because it's so small.

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, a needle weapon, that it
just comes in and then releases

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
something, and actually
stays implanted in you

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:90%
after it inoculates you.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.355 align:middle line:84%
So what I've seen
there is essentially--

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and you've got this projectile.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
On the tip of the projectile
is where you have a--

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
it's like a little
teeny needle point

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:84%
with a little teeny
amount of whatever

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
the concentrated amount
of whatever you're trying

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:90%
to inoculate someone with.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So it hits them, and
then the projectile

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:84%
bounces off or falls off, and
it leaves the needle stuck

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
in the person, and
it puts whatever

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
biological or chemical
agent that you're

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:90%
trying to inject into them.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about some of the
weaponry on the craft and some

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
of the handheld weaponry
that's kind of new that you

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:90%
haven't divulged yet.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, we were talking
about these programmable

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:90%
directed projectiles.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
That's probably about one
of the most advanced things

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:90%
that we've got.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
We do also have a newer energy
weapon-- when I say newer,

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
it's been around for
a couple of decades,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's probably
getting more broad use

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
in some of these
special forces programs,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
within covert military
space program activity.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's a directed
energy weapon

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:84%
based on an ultraviolet
frequency that

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
shoots right through walls
without leaving holes in it.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So you could hit someone
on the other side of a wall

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
without puncturing a hole
through drywall, wood,

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:90%
or brick.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But the frequency
is ultraviolet.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It passes through the
molecules in the solid object

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and hits the person on the
other side with a damaging beam,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
which does internal damage
to their internal organs,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to their bloodstream, and
can cause internal bleeding.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Since it's UV and
photonic, I would

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
have to ask, could
also be programmed

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
to have a disease or a virus or
some sort of biological aspect

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:90%
to it

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a new enough
technology that we're still

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
figuring out just what you can
send along that delivery system

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So I've heard people talk
things like giving people

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
cancer or making them
susceptible to organ

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:84%
failure, brain
hemorrhages, a lot

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
of things that can look
like they're more natural

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
causes instead of,
like, someone's

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
being attacked by
an external weapon,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
because it damages the body
internally in such a way

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that a medical exam
would just make--

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
you think someone had a sudden
organ failure or a hemorrhage

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
or something like that that
caused the death of the person.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
What about these new
suits and uniforms

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
that they're developing?

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I've been getting a
lot of intel on this.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:84%
What can you inform
us about that?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the most advanced
battle suit that I've ever used

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.480 align:middle line:84%
was pretty incredibly
sophisticated.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.932 align:middle line:90%
So you essentially have a--

00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
the older hydraulics, you know,
you have bars, hydraulics,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.125 align:middle line:84%
levers, things on them
that you can recognize.

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Like an
exoskeleton-type thing.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, as being
mechanical assisted.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The newer ones, you're
essentially sticking your body

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:84%
into a form-fitting
suit that looks like--

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, for all--

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
word, looks like

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
you're putting on the
body of a larger person.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:10%
So you can see muscle definition
because the suit itself

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:10%
is actually built like muscle.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having
hydraulics, it's

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
built with nanofibers that
are built into muscle shapes

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
so that you're
actually in a suit that

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:84%
is a nanofiber, muscular version
of a slightly bigger version

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
of yourself that you slip into.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, those are amazing.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
You get an incredible
amount of dexterity,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
agility, and even more
magnified strength

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
than you do with a couple
of single hydraulic systems

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
on the arms, because you've got
hundreds of smaller nanofibers.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You've got more
mechanical advantage

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
pulling in each muscle area,
in each part of the suit.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So you get-- again, like I
said, way more accurate, agile,

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
dexterous, and strength
addition in those suits.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen a lot of
the suits in my lifetime,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and actually tested
a lot of them.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed when they
try to over-engineer it

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
with mechanics, it
doesn't work so well.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But when they started using
nature and using the body's

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
own somatotype to
fit the person,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
it's like it just
works so much better.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, basically, you don't
make a glove shaped like not

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
a hand, you know?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't make a
weird, boxy glove

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and go, here, wear this glove
and then do a bunch of stuff

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
with it, because it
doesn't fit your hand.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that when
you make something more

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
like a human body
so that it fits

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
over the human
body like a glove,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
you get a more smooth action
between the physical body

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:90%
and the augmentation device.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you share with us any
of the materials used in these

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:90%
fibers, in these suits?

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding is they're
using the super advanced alloys

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and nanocarbon fibers, things
which are more flexible

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and stronger than your
actual muscles are,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:84%
what most industrial
materials look like.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But not being a
chemistry guy, I don't

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
know that I could
explain much more

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
about how they work
other than that they're

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
carbon fiber-based and these
sort of super alloy-based.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So some cases, you
have a metal fiber

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that is sort of based on
spider web technology.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So a spider web has the tensile
strength of multiple times

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
steel, and yet you still have
the flexibility of a string

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:90%
or a cord of some type.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:90%
So my understanding is this is--

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it is
understanding the way

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:84%
in which spider web
filaments are made

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and how to make larger fibers
out of a similar substance

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:84%
so that you get, again, this
incredible tensile strength

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.308 align:middle line:84%
and incredible flexibility that
is beyond anything that we're

00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
seeing in the industry
at the moment.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I was shown some of
this material recently.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can explain to me--

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
because it actually
can stop the bullet,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and the person actually doesn't
get the damage on the inside,

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to wear
another foam vest under that.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:90%
How is that happening?

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:84%
How is that velocity
transferring into the suit?

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's an external
part and an internal part.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.712 align:middle line:84%
And the external part,
again, is these nanofibers.

00:12:22.712 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, it has something
to do with the fact

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot of them
woven together so that you have

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
a surface area of the many,
many fibers that are absorbing

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
the shock and the
impact, and also creating

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:90%
a slightly uneven surface.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to bounce or
zing off instead of getting--

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:90%
penetrating direct.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And the under layer
is a gel that's

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
maybe just a few
millimeters thick.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But that gel layer
essentially, again,

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:84%
takes just about any
amount of shock--

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Disperses it.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> --just disperses
it through the gel.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So if I get hit in the
arm here, the force

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't get absorbed by the
nanofibers that penetrates down

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
to the under layer
hits that gel.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.798 align:middle line:84%
And then it ripples
down, up and down the arm

00:13:15.798 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and distributes through
the gel in the suit

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't
end up with high PSI

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
in a single point of contact.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And it spreads it
out so you feel it,

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
but you don't get
punctured by it

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.630 align:middle line:90%
or get a broken bone from it.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can literally stand
point blank at a machine gun,

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and bullets will
just bounce off.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's what I saw.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.300 align:middle line:84%
What about the lifesaving
components of it?

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Does it have anything
to administer

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
atropine or
lifesaving medicines?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's the
auto tourniquets,

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:90%
which are at the joints.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
senses that you've

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
had a major damage in
a limb will tighten up

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:90%
the auto tourniquet.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's
already a loop

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
around that joint that's loose,
and then it tightens it up--

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:84%
[WHOOSH] --right away so
that it cuts off the blood

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:90%
flow so you don't bleed out.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And then most of the
time, the medical pack,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:90%
it's in the left leg.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And they can put a
series of little vials

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:90%
into that injector.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
system automatically

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.470 align:middle line:84%
detects different things that
are happening biologically

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And based on certain
medical protocols,

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
it decides what it's going
to inject into the system,

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a pain
medicine or a coagulant

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
or something to stop shock
from happening if you've

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
lost a limb, or more
medical stuff that's not

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:90%
my forte that's probably yours.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's usually right
there in the left thigh.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these suits powered
by any type of energy,

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.202 align:middle line:84%
or is it using the
energy of the body?

00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> They do have an
external power source,

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
but they're using
something super advanced,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
some kind of ridiculously
advanced zero-point technology.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:84%
As a point of comparison, the
first battle suit that I ever

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:90%
put on was a little clunky.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
The power source was
probably about the size

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:84%
of a car battery that was in
a pack that was on the back.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty heavy
too, but because the suit's

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
hydraulically powered,
you didn't really notice.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But it was still about
the size of a car battery.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Way more output
than a car battery,

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:90%
but it was still about that big.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
For these more advanced
suits, the power source

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
is less than three inches by
three inches and less than half

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:90%
an inch thick.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:90%
It's tiny.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like the size of
a little hard drive.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's providing way more
power for way many more hours,

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and so it's something
super advanced.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there helmets associated
with the suit that connect

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
to the suit, or is it
just a separate piece?

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In the older suits, the
helmet was a separate piece.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
In the newer suits,
you literally

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
have an opening in the back of
the suit that you crawl into.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
That includes the
headpiece, which

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
is uni-- which is already
sealed into the suit, the arms.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And then someone basically has
to seal you up and zip you up

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:90%
from the back.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, we talked about these
amazing suits that you've been

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
involved with and trained
with, and I'm aware of some

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness-assisted
technology that some of these

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:90%
suits have had.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen this?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And is it a bad thing or is
it safe, is what I'm saying,

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:90%
for the soldier?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have the ability
to have a cerebral interface

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
in a ship so that I could sit
with my hands here and control

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:84%
all the functions of the ship
with the cerebral interface.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But because the cerebral
interface is still

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
a little hackable by
beings who have advanced

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:84%
psionic abilities,
it's not deemed as safe

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
as something that has a
digital interface where

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:84%
your fingers, your digits are
interacting with it instead

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:90%
of the cerebral interface.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have them and
we use them, but it's

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:84%
usually for optics
and sensor information

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and not for control
dynamics, because that's

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
a little hackable
and we're not feeling

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
too comfortable about
putting a technology

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
like that in our
vehicles where someone

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
could take over, an
air wing of fighters

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:90%
and turn them against us.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:90%
We don't like that idea.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that was
my next question.

00:17:23.718 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:84%
You've been in combat
with multiple races,

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and some of those races
have psionic abilities

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:90%
that can control yourself.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.465 align:middle line:84%
And if it can control
yourself, that

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
means it can control
your suit, right?

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have defensive
protocols for that.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
There are layering of
shielding that's, again,

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
sort of these advanced materials
that is able to reflect away

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
those psionic waves
in the same way

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:84%
that an internal
layer of gold foil

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:90%
will bounce back most radiation.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
If you have a material that's
reflective of psionic waves,

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:90%
that makes you--

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the technology you're
using, the ship you're in,

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and your own brain less
susceptible to some type

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:90%
of psionic hacking.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, how long do you think
it's going to take for this

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
to get to our--

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:90%
our people on the front line?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
The firefighters, the
police, the military.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the regular
military, I'll say.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the minute
we have a life-pressing need

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
for that technology-- let's just
say, hypothetically speaking,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that we had a hostile
force from elsewhere,

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
from outside our
terrestrial system.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Then we might have an immediate
need for such technology.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And under those
circumstances, I would

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
suggest that that's
when we would

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
see the introduction of
some of what I consider

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to be the older, clunkier,
antique-y technology compared

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:90%
to the newer, fancier stuff.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to seem really
new and fancy to everybody

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:90%
who's never seen it before.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to see that
older technology introduced

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
first as the new
technology before we

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
see any of the way more--
the really advanced stuff,

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going
to see that in the military

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
for, hmm, a decade or more.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.392 align:middle line:90%
Maybe two.

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it this way.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Planned obsolescence
means they've

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.175 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of other models that
they can go through and make

00:19:25.175 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
functional before
they're going to need

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to get to that level of
functionality and high-tech

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:90%
amazingness.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you divulge the
corporations involved

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that are designing
this equipment?

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:84%
If I did, I would be concerned
about unhealthy blowback

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:90%
that I don't need or want.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not forbidden
from doing so,

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
but I also don't need
to make enemies where

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to make enemies.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me just suggest
without naming names that most

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
of the companies that do this
work are already aerospace

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:84%
defense contracting companies
that are already making other

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
military hardware and just
have other divisions that

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:84%
they've created, or they're
parent companies of other

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
companies that they have made
to work on these developing

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I have also
indicated that we now

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:84%
have private space industry that
is developing private rocket

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:90%
technology for civilian use.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I've also suggested that
some of those companies

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:90%
have military contracts.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And having military contracts
gives them an opportunity

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
to develop more sophisticated,
classified military technology

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:90%
that's not rockets.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same
companies that are

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
building everything else
anyway, but I probably

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't name names.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell us about the
new next extraction vehicles?

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the fastest thing that
I have ever flown personally is

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
a high-speed cloaked vehicle,
which is designed to enter

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.850 align:middle line:84%
into a planetary space
incredibly quickly,

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
land incredibly quickly, pick
up targets, high-value targets,

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and then leave
incredibly quickly.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're narrow
cylinder-shaped so that they

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:90%
hide in scanning technology.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:84%
A disc-shaped vehicle is easier
to spot with scanners and radar

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and other advanced technology
than something that's

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:90%
a tiny cylinder or a tube.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:90%
So they tend to be very narrow.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be smaller.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be longer.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to, again,
be very high-velocity,

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
high-impact so that you
can get in somewhere very,

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:50.927 align:middle line:90%
>> How large are they?

00:21:50.927 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:84%
How many occupants can
be in one of these?

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually not more
than three or four.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
pilot, and then you

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
have room for sometimes
one to three passengers.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you need to pick
up more passengers,

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:90%
you send more ships.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's the propulsion
units on these devices?

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They're-- same
sort of EG drive,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.522 align:middle line:84%
MG magnetogravitic except
they're way more efficient

00:22:17.522 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and they're way faster.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the ways that
they seem to be getting

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
these faster, more
maneuverable ships

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
is by making smaller
magnetogravitic propulsion

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
systems and putting more
of them around the vehicle

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:84%
so that you have the
ability to maneuver

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:84%
more quickly in different
directions and get--

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:90%
what's the word I want to use?

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Faster acceleration than
you do with a single unit.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's mostly using
more drive systems

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
that are smaller and spread
around the vehicle instead

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:84%
of using, like, a central
drive or one at each corner

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
or the front of the back
or something, which has

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:90%
been the older way of doing it.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So these newer vehicles
have 30 drive units on them,

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:84%
30 little engines
that are probably

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:90%
the size of a coffee can.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's more
of them and they're

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.980 align:middle line:84%
positioned around the
vehicle so that they're

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:90%
way more maneuverable.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they in their own
electromagnetic field so they

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.457 align:middle line:84%
don't feel the gravitational
force of these high speeds?

00:23:18.457 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:84%
The inertial damper
of being contained

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
in the own gravitic field is how
you can do that as well, yeah.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we explain to
the audience, you know,

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
the speeds that we're
actually talking here?

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
they need to know.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's in-atmosphere
speeds and there's

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:90%
out-of-atmosphere speeds.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we're starting to
see hypersonic in-atmosphere

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:90%
speeds.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So being able to achieve a
40,000 to 60,000 miles an hour

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:84%
inside an atmosphere is about
what these vehicles can do now,

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:84%
which is ridiculously
faster than what we could do

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago in an atmosphere.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you're getting
speeds in open space

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that are near 100,000
miles an hour.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.466 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:24:06.466 --> 00:24:07.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:07.266 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> How are these craft
cloaking themselves?

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:84%
What type of technology
are they using?

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The latest thing
that I understand

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:84%
is an energy field
which absorbs energy

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:90%
instead of reflecting it.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So most of the scanners
work by sending out

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:84%
a wave, hitting
something, and then

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
based on the absence
of reflective space

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
or where you're getting
something reflected back

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:90%
is what tells you where it is.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
If you have a field that is
essentially absorbing that,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.758 align:middle line:84%
it makes it look
like it's not there.

00:24:38.758 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
You're not seeing it on
the scope of the scanner.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's optically not
visible because it's

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
using an active camouflage
type of technology.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Which for people
who don't understand

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that, I call it the predator
camouflage, you know?

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The bending of
light around a device.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So that if it was sitting
right here in the room,

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be able to
see it, but you'd see

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:90%
that something was there, but--

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> A little distortion.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
You would see that there was
a distortion in the space

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and go, what is that?

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.172 align:middle line:84%
But you still wouldn't
be able to see

00:25:14.172 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
what it was, what color it
was, what exactly shape it was,

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.948 align:middle line:84%
or what material
it's made out of.

00:25:18.948 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in open space
with something like that,

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.680 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty much invisible.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Randy, are you still
active in the SSP?

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I have active duty rank
and security clearance, yes.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was your
most recent mission,

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:90%
if you can talk about it?

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure that I
should, but for the most part,

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I have been in an independent
field commander status

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:90%
for about the last 10 years.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So mostly my mission has been
doing public relations work

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and teaching classes
at the moment.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But that's probably
going to change soon.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And why is that?

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We're expecting a fairly
major disclosure event to be

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:84%
occurring sometime soon, and
I'll probably be doing some

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:90%
consulting.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.817 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you think
about this new space force?

00:26:09.817 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Like, where is it heading
since they came out?

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:84%
We both know it's already
been there forever,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's funny they've
come public with it,

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and now we have it, and
the civilians are now, wow.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, now we have
this additional military.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So I saw the
recruiting commercial,

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say
that's good PR.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Whoever did that commercial,
that was good PR.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:84%
If I was 18 years
old, I'd be running

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.068 align:middle line:90%
to join the space force.

00:26:34.068 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's "Starship
Troopers" all over again.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'd be like, let's go.

00:26:37.152 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's good PR.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're going to
experience the same problems

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that anyone trying
to start a new branch

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to experience,
which is, how do you

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:90%
create a new structure?

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
How do you create a
new officer corps?

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.752 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're borrowing most
of these personnel from the Air

00:26:55.752 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Force and other
departments, you're

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:84%
still creating
something that has

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to be unique in its own way, but
functional in its own way too.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think as
they're sorting out

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:84%
what their actual
mission is, what they're

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%
really responsible for,
what their priorities are,

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be an
evolving process.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think their major
purpose at this point

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:90%
is as a public relations stunt.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be careful.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
When I say stunt, I don't mean
that it's, like, a fake thing

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:90%
or that it's just a joke.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean that.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just that their main
purpose at the moment

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
is to be a public relations
face of a changing military

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and to get people focused on the
idea of instead of a military

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that is completely focused
on terrestrial matters

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.420 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
sky, on the ground,

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that we now have
something very specific

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about that
is military action in space.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So that changes the way
people think about it.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:84%
That changes the way that
people can talk about it.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it's a big
PR move that will get people

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:84%
into a mental space so that,
again, if we experience

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:84%
something from
outside, we can pretend

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:84%
like we're not being
completely caught off guard.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.910 align:middle line:84%
We can pretend like
we've got something

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:90%
that's there to deal with that.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can have a further
public relations discussion

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:84%
about what we have
in place, what's

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
happening with whatever
interaction with whatever

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials that
we're having it with so

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:84%
that because we can't have all
the conversations that we'd

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:84%
like to have about what's
actually happening with all

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of that interaction because of
covert military space program

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.930 align:middle line:84%
activity, it gives you
a face to talk about.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a structure to
discuss and to name names,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:84%
point fingers, either
praise, clap, or lay blame

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to where we don't necessarily
want the credit or the blame

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:90%
going to a covert program.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:84%
We would rather have there be a
public face of a public program

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:90%
that can be that object.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe, Randy, that
the current secret space force

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:84%
will bleed into the current
civilian [LAUGHS] Space Force?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there's going
to maintain some separation

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:90%
for a little while.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I think mostly what we're going
to see is the trickle down.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see the
trickle down of technology,

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
information, and
personnel from the top

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:90%
down into the new program.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But most of that
is not going to be

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.010 align:middle line:84%
observable by the
civilian community.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Most of that's not going
to be observable by people

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.880 align:middle line:90%
within space force.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Most of that's
going to be observed

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:84%
by senior officers,
senior commanders,

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and people who are going to
have to be sort of in the

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:90%
know of some of those things.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.503 align:middle line:90%
But most everyone's going to--

00:29:50.503 --> 00:29:53.170 align:middle line:84%
they're just going to be able to
say, oh, look at this new thing

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.250 align:middle line:90%
that we just developed.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter whether
we've had it for three decades

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
brand new to them.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And as far as they're concerned,
it's going to be brand new.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the commanders
are going to be debriefed

on the SSP?

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.832 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the new SP
commanders I'm talking about.

00:30:09.832 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they're
actually going

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to be debriefed by
any SSP commander,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:84%
or are they going to
keep it secret still?

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding is that
senior personnel are being

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:84%
briefed, because they want them
to have a certain need to know

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.008 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening
in the near future.

00:30:26.008 --> 00:30:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to want there to be

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
some fluidity between the
information and technology

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
exchange so that those senior
officers are prepared for that,

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:90%
they know who to talk to.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.480 align:middle line:84%
They know when they're
approached by someone to say,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.643 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is someone
from this other program.

00:30:42.643 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I should pay attention
to what they're saying.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And you know, say,
yeah, I totally

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.025 align:middle line:84%
want to implement that
technology into my program

00:30:49.025 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:90%
and into my division.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And listen and
take to the advice

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
of more experienced officers
in space development

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:90%
and space exploration.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, fantastic, Randy.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.822 align:middle line:90%
That's a wealth of information.

00:31:01.822 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks for
being on the show.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Always a pleasure to be here.

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.
