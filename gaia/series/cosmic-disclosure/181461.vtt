00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hey, everybody.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.710 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:10%
And we are back with Jason Rice.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.695 align:middle line:10%
How you doing?

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:26.480 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Doing great, Jay.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Yeah, we're going to get
into some interesting questions

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:10%
here today.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:90%
What I'd like to know is--

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess we'll start on Planet
One, the first planet you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:90%
went to.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
What are like the social customs
on the planet between sexes

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and between people?

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Are they similar to ours?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Or are they different or what?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The social structure of
the areas where people were--

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't a single
planetary government

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
upon our arrival, each
of their respective areas

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
had their own customs
and their own systems

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%
of belief and governance.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So the areas that
I'm familiar with--

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
their method of governing was
based on a guild clan system.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is that for each

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
of the different
trades that they had,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
those trades would alternate
through a position of who's

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
in charge, basically, for
that city or that region.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And what it did was
it allowed for sharing

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
of that responsibility
amongst the different groups.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what you had
was a natural balance

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.519 align:middle line:84%
in which one trade or guild
wouldn't try to take advantage

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:90%
while they were in power.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Because in less than the
equivalent of a year,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
somebody else is
going to be there.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it allowed them to
equally share amongst--

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
what's the best
for the community.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And it worked out very well
for the areas that we're in.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So from a control standpoint
and our governance standpoint,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.395 align:middle line:84%
it was a rotating position
that essentially they

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
had established.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, from a social structure,
each of the families

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
generally stayed along the
same guild trade occupation.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you ended up
with is a family that--

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's the other
thing is that families--

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
when they were bonding,
when they had a bond,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
what we would consider to
be a marriage-- although,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:90%
they didn't call it that--

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.296 align:middle line:84%
that couple would move in
with the bride's family.

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
compounds in which

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
it was a multi-generational
association right there.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And so people had their
own private spaces,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:90%
but they were all right there.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
They would have
their space over here

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
for those kids, space
over here for those kids.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And they would expand
it if they needed to.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But you ended up with
multi-generational groups,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
usually within the same
trade or the same guild that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:90%
lived on the same property.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That's interesting
that they would

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
go with the bride's family.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I thought
that same thing.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So is it matriarchal?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, not necessarily.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It was shared between both
matriarch and patriarch.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I think by going
with the matriarchal family,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
it helped to encourage
that sharing.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't necessarily
one over the other.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Because there weren't
any jobs or occupations

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:90%
that were blocked based on sex.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd have women
that were doing everything

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:90%
that the men were doing.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it allowed them to keep
a better balance, if you will.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if you had
a heavy-lifting guild,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
some guild like carpenters
that lift big beams,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:84%
the women would be right
there with the men?

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
They would be right
there with them.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And these are humanoids?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were humanoids.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They were a little smaller
than in Western or European

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
humanoids, probably on par with
some of the size of a smaller

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Asian culture.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.515 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Southeast Asians?

00:04:58.515 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:90%
So they were a little smaller.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:90%
But proportionally, were--

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Same?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: --the same.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they had
sexes-- two sexes?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.966 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they fall in
love with each other?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And they also had a version
of what we would consider

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:90%
to be arranged marriages.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, commonly what
comes to mind when

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
you think of an
arranged marriage

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
is somebody is being
forced to do something

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:90%
that they don't want to do.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was not
the case from what

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I experienced or saw
on Planet One in that,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:90%
yes, they were arranged.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you had
certain families that

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:84%
wanted to improve the reach or
the bond with another family.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it came down to
veto power of the individuals.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So if they said no way,
then it wasn't happening.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if you
had a guild of--

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- auto mechanics.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And the girl, the young
woman, brings a man

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
in from the outside into the
family, which is the custom,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.869 align:middle line:84%
is he also an auto
mechanic, or a carpenter,

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the guild is?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Or does he learn that guild?

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not necessarily.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Part of the education
system that they have

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
involves a creche
type in which children

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
will learn from their own
family the trades that they

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.530 align:middle line:90%
are involved with.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:84%
But then what they
would also do is

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't spend all
of their formative years

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:90%
just learning that one thing.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:90%
They would rotate.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And it did several things.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
It allowed for a sharing
of their responsibilities,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
so that one person wasn't
always responsible for educating

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:90%
a child.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It ended up allowing
them to have children

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that rotated through
different trades,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and so that they could focus
on things that they really

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:90%
enjoyed and were good at.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And through experiencing
those things,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.697 align:middle line:84%
they were able to get the
exposure to find out, hey,

00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I was a good
fisherman until I went over

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:90%
to Joe's place.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.239 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm a good fisherman.

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the educational
system was really

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:84%
having the kids move around
through the guilds learning

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:90%
the different skill sets?

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Gotcha.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And it also provided
them with backup.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
In case the event
of illness or death,

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
they had people
that were trained

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:84%
in doing all the basics
of the various guilds,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
then say, OK, hey,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
we need somebody to
come help out with X.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd have people that
had all gone through training

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.155 align:middle line:90%
in how to do whatever that was.

00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And then marriage?

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Was there a marriage ceremony?

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was
a bonding ceremony.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
They didn't go down to the
justice of the peace and sign

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:90%
documents.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They had a ceremony in which
they signified the bonding

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:90%
of the two families.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there
any interactions

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.175 align:middle line:84%
between the different
groups on a formal basis?

00:08:03.175 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: There were.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
There were some
outlying villages

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that because of their size
or because of their isolation

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
didn't have as developed
a social network

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
system as some of the
larger cities like Area 26.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
outlying villages may

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:84%
have had four or five
families, instead of 4 or 500,

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:90%
or 1,000 families.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
And so you would have shared
resources in which, OK,

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to take their goods
and services into the big city

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and then trade for
supplies, or materials,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was that they
couldn't manufacture, or make,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:90%
or produce, or find themselves.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:84%
On Planet One, they hadn't
known conflict or war

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:90%
for generations.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.740 align:middle line:84%
They had one area on
the planet that there

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.530 align:middle line:84%
were weapons that were still
being manufactured and more

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
of a hobby than anything else.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were there hospitals
or any kind of medical staff

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.032 align:middle line:90%
available for the people?

00:09:10.032 --> 00:09:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Or did they just take
care of themselves?

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was a
shaman-like guild that

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
was in charge of taking
care of growing herbs,

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
spices, things that they
used for medicinal purposes.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So the large cities had these
particular guilds spread out

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
in key areas, so that the
people were able to best benefit

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:90%
from those skills.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if you broke your
arm, where would you go?

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You'd go down
to the equivalent

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:90%
of a clinic on a street corner.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the families
lived on the same compound

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
where they had their businesses,
their guilds, their trades.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So you would go to the trade
that was the medical trade.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Were there books?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Do they read?

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They had books.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
written language.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.555 align:middle line:84%
They had their
own developed art.

00:10:13.555 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all throughout the
city, Area 26, there was art.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the city was built
with a very extensive canal

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
system similar to
what you would see

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
in modern Holland,
in which they had

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
a combination of small roadways
where it was large enough

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:90%
to push a cart or to walk.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And then next to it was a canal.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the bulkier,
heavier, larger shipments

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
of goods and material
was done on the canal,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:84%
because it was a lot easier to
move things around on a boat.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Do they use work animals?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No work animals?

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No work animals.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.659 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So how did they
move their carts around?

00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They pushed them.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They pushed them?

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.267 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it's a pretty
low-level technology

00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:90%
here on this planet.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was, not including
the artificial light source.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they were
more interested

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in their daily
day-to-day activities

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
than they were in progressing
or improving their technologies.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What do they
do for entertainment?

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had games
that they played,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.385 align:middle line:84%
an equivalent of Kick
the Can, or throwing

00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:39.170 align:middle line:84%
a ball through a hoop,
or even something

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
very similar to checkers,
strangely enough.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, everything
from singing to they

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.395 align:middle line:90%
had some musical instruments.

00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What kind of
musical instrument?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: One of them was very
similar to a lute-guitar.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:10%
Another one that drums.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't think you can
find any civilization that

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:10%
doesn't have some kind of drum.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.844 align:middle line:90%
They had their own.

00:12:05.844 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Were they good?

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Were their musicians
really good?

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The ones that I heard--

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the developed and mature
guilds, that they were--

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:84%
they'd studied, and practiced,
and worked on everything

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:90%
from art.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of the guilds were
dedicated to music.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if I was born
into a carpenter's guild,

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
but I really wanted
to play the lute,

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
was I stuck being a carpenter
or could I go to another guild?

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
There was a number of instances
where the interplay like that

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:90%
was allowed.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
If the family was not able
to give up those extra hands,

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
then they would work to
finding a replacement.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.542 align:middle line:84%
And that's usually
where arranged

00:12:58.542 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:90%
relationships came into play.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I got you now.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So it wasn't,
no, you can't do it,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:84%
because we need you
here on the farm.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It was, OK, well--

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
they would work together
to find a solution

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:90%
on how to make that happen.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Because part of
their culture was

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:84%
the pursuit of the individual's
skills along with what

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:90%
they liked doing.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there any
kind of confrontation

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
between different
kinds of people?

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there any kind of
clan rivalry going on?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The last time something
like that had occurred

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
was three generations
before our arrival.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So they had lived peacefully and
cooperatively for a long time

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
before we got there,
before the invasion.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How about law
enforcement, jails, courts,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:90%
prosecutors, lawyers?

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, none
of that nonsense.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What if I broke a law?

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:90%
What would happen to me?

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The people
that broke laws--

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:84%
the consequences of such
were a group decision

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
by the governing
council, if you will.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Each of the trade unions
or the clans, the guilds

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:90%
had representatives.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So each guild was a
microcosm of the larger city.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So within each guild, you have,
again, leadership positions

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:90%
that rotate.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a governing
council, if you will,

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:90%
of each of the guilds.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And that governing
council meets together

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:90%
with other governing councils.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And so if someone broke a law--

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
or there was no need
to steal something.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if you needed
it, you made something

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that you were familiar
with how to make.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you found somebody
that was willing to trade.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what about
crimes of passion?

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They may have existed.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I was not aware of any
during our times there.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That changed as the
war came and developed.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And over the period
of the war, they--

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
when we first arrived--

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
had an alcohol--
one alcoholic drink.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
fermented wine of sorts.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:90%
By the time the war had ended--

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
because of the interactions
with Earth humans

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge that was
brought with Earth humans

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:84%
about distillation and
additional fermentation,

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:84%
they ended up having
a larger variety.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the Earth forces that
were there wanted to have that.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they got
interested and, oh, wow,

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
this is another
alcoholic beverage.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did alcoholism
begin then?

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: When I left,
it had not, simply,

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I think, because of the
fact that it comes down

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:90%
to brutal simplicity.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Those that are able to move and
fight were required to fight.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.437 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
leave much time for--

00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: For partying.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.472 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --partying or
extracurricular activities.

00:16:10.472 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they have any
kind of drug problems?

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
This planet did have
its own marijuana

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.316 align:middle line:84%
analog that was used
during ceremonial events.

00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I was just
going to get at that.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Do they have any
psychedelic plants?

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Anything like that
they would use?

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The marijuana analog
that they used on Planet One

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
was mildly hallucinogenic.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And its uses were limited
to spiritual ceremonies.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And as far as any
other drugs that--

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come across any
others that they had used.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.155 align:middle line:90%
That was the only one.

00:16:46.155 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you witness any of
their spiritual ceremonies?

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was able to
witness a bonding ceremony.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And once the invasion
began, a lot of that

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:84%
had to take a backseat,
because of the preparations

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:90%
to clean up.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What have you
learned from being

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:84%
with this other
civilization that you think

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.420 align:middle line:90%
we can draw from here on Earth?

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything?

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, there's
a bunch of things.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah?

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:13.649 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Like we don't need
a fiat currency system.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They do not
have a currency?

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They did not
have a currency system.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Their currency were
their products, goods,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:90%
and their time.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:90%
So then they would never--

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.573 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Native
Americans didn't use it

00:17:24.573 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:90%
for how many thousands of years?

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
fiat currency system.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Currency is
established as a means

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to organize and coordinate
the distribution

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and use of resources.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason for a currency.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you have an alternative
to a fiat currency system,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
then the fiat currency
system is pointless.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So just barter and trade?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how they governed?

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That was
how they did it.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.335 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Any other
things that they

00:17:54.335 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:90%
have that we should be doing?

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think the integration
of a geo-power system into each

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
home is also a
fantastic thing that--

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:84%
hey, who wouldn't like to have
a elimination of their power

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Every single
house on this planet

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:90%
had its own power source?

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: At least one of the
buildings on each of the family

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:90%
compounds.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you say that
they're a civilization that's

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:84%
a little bit backwards from
us, maybe like a hundred years

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:90%
ago or so.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But we had rudimentary
electricity a hundred years ago

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.186 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, but
we didn't use it for much

00:18:35.186 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
at the time, outside of
lighting, and running

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:90%
the radios, and all that.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:84%
What do they use their
power system for?

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:90%
How did they use it?

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And why didn't they invent
stuff that would help

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:90%
them push the carts and things?

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.805 align:middle line:90%
And that's a great question.

00:18:48.805 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they develop
higher technology,

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:90%
more advanced technology?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:10%
And when I asked
them this question,

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:10%
they didn't see a need to.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
They used the electricity
for artificial light

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:84%
within the main dwelling on each
of their property or compound.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:10%
And from that point, for
me, they cooked with fire.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:84%
They had something very similar
to a wood-burning stove.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
If they needed to put something
in an oven, which they

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
did bake things,
they had a Dutch oven

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that they would use with
a wood-burning stove.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The whole alien aspect
of this is that they

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:90%
don't think like we do.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Humanity looks at
technology as, OK,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:90%
where's the next great thing?

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
How can we improve on and
change XY and Z to come up

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:90%
with a better mousetrap?

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Their philosophy was based
on the day-to-day activities

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and putting as much of
themselves into that,

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:90%
rather than trying to change it.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever witness
any type of slavery or coercion

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of another person to do labor
for free on this planet?

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: On Planet One, or
Planet Two, Calidus Three--

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
The only experience
that I had where

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
there was something
close to forced labor

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
was on Planet Three.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Planet Three was
the only place that

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:90%
had an organized crime element.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Planet One, or Planet
Two, Calidus Three--

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
neither of those had any forced
labor instances or examples

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:90%
that I'd see.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The famous
anthropologist, Margaret Mead,

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
pointed out that anytime
that Western civilization,

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
whether it be
troops, or doctors,

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:84%
or whatever would come into
a non-developed country,

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that presence, just the presence
alone would change that culture

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
usually for the worse.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.342 align:middle line:90%
That must have happened--

00:21:04.342 --> 00:21:05.141 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course.

00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --on these planets.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:84%
What happened after
you guys were there?

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:84%
What kind of effects
did you have?

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, we
weren't on planet

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
as long as we had hoped to be
before the invasion started.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The operation plan called
for 12 to 18 months

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
of intel gathering,
of getting familiar

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:84%
with the local operators,
the local people,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:84%
inserting ourselves
into those societies,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
so that we could develop
positive relationships

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:90%
So that period of preparation--

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we weren't allowed to
finish, because the invasion

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:90%
came early.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
The long-term effects
on those societies

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:90%
were absolutely devastating.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: In what way?

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, for
the larger cities

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:84%
where there were thousands
of people already,

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
we would see them as being
more open to alternatives,

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
because they had more
examples of culture.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
The small villages that were
out in the middle of nowhere,

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
where there was only
four or five families

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and their life on
a daily basis was

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
all about survival and
continuing on with children

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:90%
and grandchildren.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They had their own version of
art and the expression of that.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But it was different than
a large-- one of the larger

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:90%
population centers.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
effects did it have?

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, the war must have
had certainly a large effect.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.246 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It had a
tremendous effect

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:90%
on the people themselves.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Exposure to that
kind of devastation,

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and destruction, and death
changes a civilization.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And theirs was no
exception from that.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
When the war came,
what happened is

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that we started
bringing in people

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
from the remote villages,
because they were completely

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
exposed for one thing.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And there was no way that
they could defend themselves.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And so another
aspect of that was

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to have
full participation of all

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
the peoples, so
that we could mount

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:90%
a defense against the invasion.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And so in a certain respect,
most of the villages

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:90%
were willing to come in.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come across any
villages that openly fought it.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.714 align:middle line:84%
But there were villages
and locations in which

00:23:51.714 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:90%
people didn't want to leave.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:90%
They didn't care.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.626 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever
do anything that you

00:23:55.626 --> 00:23:57.360 align:middle line:90%
regretted to those people?

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You didn't?

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Hmm-mm.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.761 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you know
anybody that did things?

00:24:00.761 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I would say that--

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:90%
let me amend that.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Looking back,
wishing that I could

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
have helped more certainly
falls into that category--

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --in that, do I
wish that their civilization

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and their culture didn't have
to become homogenized as a need

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:90%
for fighting the war?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, certainly.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What were the effects
of this homogenation?

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Elimination
of certain cultures.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And probably skills, too.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Skill sets.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you guys
introduce high technology

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:90%
into this situation?

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: On Planet One when
we left that deployment,

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I was not able to
participate in the rebuilding

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
efforts of Planet One
after the war was over.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So I can't answer
it for that one.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:84%
For Planet Two-- and
again, all the way

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.210 align:middle line:84%
through the wars for
Planet One and Planet Two,

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:84%
the whole concept
was we don't want

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to use our advanced
technology, because we

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
don't want to poison
them, which turned out

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:90%
to be an absolute propaganda.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when I went
back to Calidus Three

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to help with the rebuilding
efforts in the 30 or so months

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that I was gone, it
had transformed from,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
no, we don't want to
poison their civilization

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:90%
with too much technology.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Transform from that
to, how quickly

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and how much can we grow this
civilization into a spacefaring

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:90%
society?

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:90%
It was a 180-degree change.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that that was
the intent all along, again,

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
playing into, how do we force
every person on the planet

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to buy in and
consent to whatever

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:90%
it is that we're requiring?

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, by killing
off a lot of people

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and forcing them to-- in
order to survive, having

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:90%
to give in to certain things.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And part of that plan was
the limitation of technology,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because that would
have saved more lives.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So the command structure
didn't allow us to use that

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.101 align:middle line:84%
and saying all the
whole time-- lying

00:26:21.101 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that it was because
they didn't want

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:90%
to poison the civilization.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
No, it's they wanted
to control how much

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and how many people were lost.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And so once the war was
over and I went back

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to help with the rebuilding
efforts, it was open season.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I helped with the
establishment of one

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
of their orbital platforms, one
of their first orbital cities.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So you go from holding
back and withholding

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:84%
advanced technologies
to, let's help

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
you develop as
quickly as you can

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
is going to destroy

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:84%
any of the society and
civilization culture

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Was that the point?

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's the point.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That was the point.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The whole point was
actually to ruin their society.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: To bring it into a
single-ruled, one government

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
system in which overall control
could be wielded against.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So essentially, when
you arrived at these planets,

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:84%
you brought the entire
future to them immediately.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any chance
to progress like we do.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
They just got
everything at once,

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and that had to be
psychologically debilitating.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, suddenly there
are seedy establishments.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Prostitution?

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They had progressed
to a point where

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the
businesses that had developed.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there any
unusual family arrangements

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.449 align:middle line:84%
that you witnessed
on any other planets?

00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a
great question, Jay.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
On Calidus Three,
the social structure

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
of each of their
families were such

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:84%
that you would have anywhere
from one couple to four couples

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:90%
that were considered a family.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't like
conventional polygamy

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.060 align:middle line:90%
as we would see it.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Because each person--
an individual

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:90%
was considered to be equal.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And so you would have,
say, three couples

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
in which the male
part of couple one

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
considered himself to be
bonded with or in our terms

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
married to the individuals
of couple two and three.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, these weren't the
sexual relationship such

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that it was only a
heterosexual relationship.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But the bonding of
those couples were such

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that they considered all of
the individuals to be their--

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:84%
what we call a
husband or a wife.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.732 align:middle line:90%
And so it--

00:29:10.732 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what would be
the advantage of this?

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The
advantages that I saw

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:22.300 align:middle line:84%
was that they were able to
really take the-- it takes

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:84%
a village to raise a family
to the next level in the sense

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that all of the
individuals were involved,

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:84%
even if only one
couple had kids.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I gotcha.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
All the kids had
multiple parents.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah-- had multiple
parents with multiple careers

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:90%
or varying degrees of--

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.985 align:middle line:84%
and this is what they
do for their living.

00:29:42.985 --> 00:29:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, they had
that support structure.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there anything
on Earth that's taboo,

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that's accepted by any of these
other cultures, like something

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:84%
here that we would not allow
that they were OK with?

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think some
of the child labor

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:84%
that they encouraged
and fostered.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Many in Western civilization
would look at as--

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:90%
that's child labor slavery.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of their culture
was training the kids.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, they cared for them.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to endanger them.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So if it involves getting
up to the top of a mast

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:84%
on a sailing ship so that they
could fix something up there,

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:84%
that's not something
you send a kid to do.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think perhaps that's
one of the things that

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:90%
would be looked down upon.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But if you looked at
rural America a hundred years

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:90%
ago, I think--

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, yeah.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: --those children today--
we would say that was running

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:90%
those kids ragged--

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: --6:00 in the
morning till late at night,

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.980 align:middle line:90%
working on the farm.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.395 align:middle line:90%
Very famous for that.

00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:59.441 align:middle line:84%
And so it depends on your
culture and where you're at.

00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a rural
culture, you're

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:90%
going to be working a lot.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: If you're an urban
culture, not so much.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they never sent the
kids off to school or anything

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: On Planet One,
the school for children

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
was the process of rotating
through the different guilds

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.090 align:middle line:90%
and learning the trades.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
They had established academics,
if you want to call it that--

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
those that knew the written
language and could read some

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of their ancestors'
written languages.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So there were scholars.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:90%
And there were college--

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:84%
something like a higher
institution for people

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:90%
who had known abilities to--

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, actually,
there wasn't.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Any of the higher
education would

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.150 align:middle line:84%
have come from the academics,
the scholar's guild.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so philosophy,
or history, or--

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Art.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:05.155 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --art is included
or sub-categories of that.

00:32:05.155 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there more
than one language

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:90%
or was there just one language?

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was more
than one language--

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:18.590 align:middle line:84%
the Area 26 that I spent
a large amount of time in.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.320 align:middle line:84%
There were also
some remote villages

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.820 align:middle line:90%
relatively close to Area 26.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:31.640 align:middle line:84%
During the consolidation phase,
opening phases of the war,

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.170 align:middle line:84%
we redeployed to
certain arctic areas

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:84%
to try and help with
the relocation of people

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.210 align:middle line:84%
from those areas to
defensible positions,

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
so that they could be
protected as much as we could.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.050 align:middle line:84%
They had different
languages there.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Besides
being aware of you,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
are these people on these
other planets aware that there

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is this whole galaxy
of beings around them?

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Before our arrival?

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They're just isolated?

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Isolated.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Adopted-- their sun, or moon,
or wind gods were the ones.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What's your
takeaway from interacting

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:90%
with these other civilizations?

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:84%
What would you like
us to learn from them?

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I would say that
preservation of a culture

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.080 align:middle line:90%
requires certain boundaries.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.695 align:middle line:90%
And that's not bad.

00:33:24.695 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
If you go on the
premise that we are but

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
a thought that occurs in the
mind of God, in which this

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:84%
is an opportunity
for God to experience

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
himself and experience life in
the many, many, many multitudes

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that exist, having
separate cultures

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:90%
allows for that expression.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if you end up with
the same cookie-cut experience

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:84%
every time, you're not
getting a varied experience.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
You're having the same
experience a thousand times,

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:84%
instead of a
thousand experiences.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:84%
I would say, Jay, that my
takeaway from my own experience

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:22.830 align:middle line:84%
is that preserving
the unique cultures

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:90%
may require having boundaries.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And whether those are physical
or figurative boundaries--

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.477 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:34:34.477 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Thanks, Jason,
for being on the show.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:38.059 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And thank you,
Jay, for having me.

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:84%
As you know, this is all
about full disclosure.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It is.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm Jay Weidner.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And you've been watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.409 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.220 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> They have special
physics, and energies,

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and sciences that we don't
understand yet that can help

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:90%
the Earth heal itself.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If they remain on that
path of becoming mostly machine

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and partly live
being, then they are

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.207 align:middle line:84%
handing over their free
will and relinquishing it

00:35:15.207 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:90%
to being controlled.
