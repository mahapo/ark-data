00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Randy Cramer,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:10%
who has participated in a covert
military space program for 18

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:10%
years called the
Earth Defense Force.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking
about ET civilizations

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%
and the future of humanity.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.538 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me, Emery.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What ET civilizations
currently that you're allowed

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
to talk about are
connected to humankind?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So probably the best
candidate to talk about there

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:90%
is a group called the Cortium.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:84%
The Cortium are a
humanoid species.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
They look very, very
similar to you and I. Again,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
they have a slightly enlarged
cranium compared to you or I.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So if one were
wearing a hat, you

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:90%
might not be able to notice.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:90%
But that's a big maybe.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.075 align:middle line:84%
So they otherwise are
incredibly similar.

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So they could
walk amongst us,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and it'd be really difficult
for us to see them?

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
It would be, for sure.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:84%
They're also psionically capable
enough that you wouldn't maybe

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:90%
see the extra cranium.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
You might just see a
regular person's skull

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
if they walk past
you on the street.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What's their main
focus here and their--

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
what are they looking
to do to help us?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They joined up with
US military forces back

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s to try and help
us with some of our engineering

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:90%
technological solutions.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple
species that came along

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
after we'd made our
agreement, our bad agreement,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:90%
with the Zetas.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And what year was that?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to say this would
have been between 1963, 1964--

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.275 align:middle line:90%
before 1965, I would say.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So then who came
right after them,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
because now we're
talking about--

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
you said additional
species that helped?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the Cortium showed
up and came along and gave us

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
some information about the Zetas
that we did not have before

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:90%
and were really nice about it.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come along and
say, oh, you made a bad deal,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:90%
you got to go back on that.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
They were like, sorry
you made a crappy deal.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can help you
weasel your way out of this

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
over maybe the
next decade or two

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:84%
because maybe you
can weasel out of it.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So they helped us in
a very technologically

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:90%
sound and legally sound way--

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:84%
helped us weasel out of a
very bad agreement, a very bad

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:90%
treaty, with the Zetas.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like a very
civilized action they allow us

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>> They are a very
civilized group of people.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I would say that their
entire existence is really

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
about being more civilized
and helping other species be

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
more civilized.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And where are they from?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I think they're
from Betelgeuse.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>> How long have they been
interacting with humankind?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, like I said, at
least since the 1960s,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:10%
working with the US military.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But we do find most species have
been here at least once longer

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So they're-- usually,
someone shows up.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
They've been here before,
whether it was 100 years, 1,000

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:90%
years, 5,000 years ago.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So they've been here before.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.338 align:middle line:84%
But they started working with
us currently in mid-1960s.

00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they still active?

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than technology, did
they share anything else with

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:90%
us?

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they were critical
in helping us engage with

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.777 align:middle line:84%
the intergalactic political
system, which again, at first,

00:03:42.777 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
everyone's about,
we need information,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
we need technology,
we need tools.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But it became much more
important to understand--

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
our own mental development
was really critical there--

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the framework
and the larger stage in which

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
we were on socially, politically
that we needed to understand

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and get involved in, or
we were just going to be--

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.638 align:middle line:84%
piece on a chessboard being
moved by someone else.

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they ever speak
about their belief systems?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> They're very practical
about getting along,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
working together for
mutually beneficial goals,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
dispensing with petty internal
conflicting with one another.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
They're really about teaching
individual species, look,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
you have more in
common on this planet

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
than you have not
in common, certainly

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
compared to everyone
else that's out there.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.875 align:middle line:84%
So how about you
start working together

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and work together as
a team here instead

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:90%
of fighting amongst yourselves?

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there other species
below them that were working

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
with them to help us?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.093 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I have a
full, complete list of that.

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a few
of them, right?

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that it
started out '40s and '50s.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
We were dealing with less
than three different groups

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:90%
or species or organizations.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
That started to expand pretty
quickly by the late 1950s

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:90%
to half a dozen, maybe.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And then by early 1960s,
that was closer to a dozen.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And that number
grew pretty quickly.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But those first half
a dozen or a dozen

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
were showing up to try
and help out after we

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:90%
had gotten into a bad deal.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you name
a couple of them?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I mentioned the
Cortium already.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Cortium.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The Centauri--

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned them before.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that
the Tall Whites,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:90%
which is a hybrid group--

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
they were also showing
up about late 1950s,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
early 1960s to help
with the programs

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that they were working out in
the test sites out in Nevada--

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
so Range Four Harry
and all that stuff.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do they come from?

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And what exactly is
their agenda with us?

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding is they are
a hybrid of a-- one of the Zeta

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Reticulan species and a humanoid
species that's very similar

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:90%
to us so that they are--

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
were used as an interactive
bridge builder between species,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:84%
between a humanoid species
and Zeta Reticulans

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
by having a hybrid that could
communicate in their language

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and be more like them.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So they were originally
engineered as a--

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
sort of a front man.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But from what we understand,
like so many of the Zeta's

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
projects, they broke away and
were like, screw you guys,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to do
whatever you want to do.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We want to do what
we want to do.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And we want to go and find our
own home and be our own people.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And screw you guys.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So their being
here had something

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
to do with them knowing that
their progenitors were here

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and that they had some
information and/or

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
some technology and/or
some assistance they

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:90%
could help with.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But it very quickly
became, hey, we don't want

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.250 align:middle line:90%
to just front for these guys.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.188 align:middle line:90%
Can we get our own space?

00:07:04.188 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there something
here they want?

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we get a ranch
in Montana or something?

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
arrange whatever they

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
could for their own
individual freedom--

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:84%
so not sure how many of
them there are or were.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.668 align:middle line:84%
But it was a number
under a million,

00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
whatever in the number of
thousands, tens of thousands,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, hundreds
of thousands,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
which wanted something,
wanted a place to settle,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
wanted some spot that
they could call home,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and made an arrangement to
no longer front for the Zetas

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:84%
so that they could get, again,
a metaphorical ranch in Montana.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:84%
They've helped, again,
engineers in the lab, people.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:84%
They've certainly negotiated
for probably the largest

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
number of units of children's
clothing over the decades.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So when they ship
stuff out, their--

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
one of their largest
shipments that they ship out

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is just hundreds and
hundreds of thousands

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.098 align:middle line:84%
of units of children's
clothing every year,

00:08:07.098 --> 00:08:08.140 align:middle line:90%
a couple of times a year.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> How bizarre.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
They like our
clothes or they know

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
someone who's this size
that likes our clothes.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I get a sense.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever value it
has to us and to them,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it has an even
greater value to whoever

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:32.730 align:middle line:84%
they're shipping it to and
making a stage 3 profit on that

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that's probably a lot more than
what it costs us to make or we

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
would normally sell them for.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they--
children's clothes.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> What is their level
of intelligence compared

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:90%
to humans?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's slightly higher.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Their IQ is slightly higher.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But the ability to do
calculations per second,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, equals
intelligence or smarts.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of knowledge.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of intelligence.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've learned
that intelligence is more

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:90%
than just computation power.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
They're smarter than
us as far as book

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
smart, encyclopedia
smart, math smart.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
My experience dealing with
them in combat is they're dumb.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:90%
They're easy to trick.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:90%
They're easy to fool.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:90%
They're easy to provoke.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of things tactically

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
that we would consider-- that
if it worked on a human being,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:90%
we'd go, wow, they're sad.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:90%
That's pathetic.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So just because they're
intellectual smart,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:84%
the fact that some of these
other tactics work on them

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:90%
does not--

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes them look like--

00:09:38.502 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Makes them look dumb,
makes them look like rubes.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Do these other two species
have different MOs than

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:90%
the Cortium?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Everyone seems to have
their own modus operandi.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So even if there is a certain
agreement about larger goals,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:84%
whether it's social,
mental, or technological,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
individual species
groups can still

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
have a very particular
way of engaging,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:84%
of requesting or demanding
that something be done,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or how they might
react to, let's say,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:90%
things not going smoothly.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So, I guess that's
kind of vague.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But what I mean is you can
have one group or another

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that is as distinctly different
from a really nice parent

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
versus a parent that always
wants to tell you that what

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:90%
you're doing is wrong.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So not every
extraterrestrial friend

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is super understanding of
where we are in our position.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So some might be a
lot more, that's OK,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that's where you're at, let's
keep working it through,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
versus one that might be, oh,
what, you stupid monkey can't

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%
get it right again?

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Big surprise there.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So just because they're
helping doesn't always

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:90%
mean they're nice.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Do any of these species have the
ability to time travel or see

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:90%
into the future?

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And does that affect their
decision-making today?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Time travel technology
is a little complicated

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and breaks down in
different types.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So a species that has access
to time travel technology

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that they are
a time traveling species.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So the ability to look
forwards and backwards in time

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:84%
is pretty rudimentary
for most species

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
once they reach a certain
technological level.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Actually wanting to move
through or impact that reality--

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:90%
some seek that power.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Some don't.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Some are like, nah,
let's not mess with time.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get monkeys
ruling the earth and stuff.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's not do that.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So not everybody who can
mess with time wants to.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody that can mess
with it without being regulated

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
by-- anyway, so time
travel technology--

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I would say even if they
do have access to it,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
it's not usually something
that we would have

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.190 align:middle line:90%
to concern ourselves with it.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But they would certainly
use their ability

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
to see into the future
to try to help decide

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
what best thing that
they can do to help

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:90%
assist the process along.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.887 align:middle line:84%
>> So how are they interacting
with us then, and why?

00:12:23.887 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Is that one of the
ways they're trying

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
to help make the right
decision for the future?

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this point, they're
in an advisory position.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So there are advisors
who stand around

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
where other military
intelligence

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
personnel are doing their jobs
and give input and advise.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What types of leaders
are they advising?

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:90%
You said military--

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Military intelligence
personnel, yeah,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
senior military intelligence
personnel in covert military

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:90%
space program activities.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this part of the secret
space programs or is this part

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
of our space force and
our military today?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Today?

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Covert, today?

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.903 align:middle line:90%
I would say covert--

00:13:01.903 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I would say these are things
that have always been covert,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
will continue to be covert,
but that any minute now, we

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
could see some military
programs getting read into some

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:84%
of these other programs
that I might not get briefed

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:84%
or told about it until weeks
or months after the fact,

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:90%
if that occurs.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't say that we
have a knowing right now

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
of who is getting
read into what.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But it is being suggested
to me that there

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
are more military personnel,
more senior military personnel,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
on this side of the
fence who have not

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
been read in for
years or decades who

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.965 align:middle line:90%
are starting to get briefings.

00:13:43.965 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they're
getting briefed on.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're getting told.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:84%
More importantly, I don't know
what they're not being told.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%
But there's some change there.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
There is some exchange
of information

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
that's happening that was
not happening five years ago.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Besides advising and sharing
these technologies with us,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:84%
are-- what are these other
species doing to help with us?

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And how are they
interacting in that way?

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like I said,
combination of advising social,

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:84%
political, military intelligence
leaders, advising scientists,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
engineers, and developers
on technology tools,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:90%
manufacturing methods.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially doing
their job, which is to--

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of going out
into the sticks to a small farm

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:84%
community that has no indoor
plumbing, no electricity,

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.595 align:middle line:84%
no streetlamps, no hospital--
and comes along and says,

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
OK you guys need to
build a hospital.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:90%
We need to put streetlamps in.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:90%
We need to pave the roads.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.610 align:middle line:90%
We need to put in some plumbing.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And we need to put
in some electricity.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.903 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to help.

00:14:51.903 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody
wants the help--

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> What propels them to help us?

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Why are they--

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, their entire
philosophy is civilism,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
which is civilization is the
bulwark against all barbarism

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
strong civilization,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
then you have strong
tendencies for barbarism

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to want to erode and
destroy civilization.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
That's just a norm
throughout the universe.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> How is the
contact first made?

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And are they ruled over
by the Galactic Senate?

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe first
contact in this case--

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
they landed at an airfield
and got out and said, hey,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
what's up, and shook hands
and introduced themselves.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:90%
They speak multiple languages.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:90%
They're psionic.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But they usually don't
communicate telepathically just

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's more secure when
you're-- as a species that is

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:84%
not telepathic to have someone
come talk to you in a language

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
think thoughts at you.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So they use
communication as a means

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
of connecting with species
that are not as developed

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and making them feel
more comfortable by using

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:90%
their native languages.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So they can speak any Terran
language when they come here.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, they're absolutely
sanctioned and connected

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:90%
to the Galactic Senate.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're here.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Are their agendas
self-serving or benevolent?

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you're talking
about species who are operating

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
through the galactic
bureaucracy,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
more often than not,
their agenda is helpful.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that someone doesn't

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:84%
take a job because
there's something

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:90%
self-serving about it.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So there are still
those who may be

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:84%
doing something that
is helpful, and also

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:84%
self-serving in
some way to them.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't guarantee that
every volunteer for the Red

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Cross is just there to help.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:90%
But most of them are.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:90%
But most of them are.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Of the species
you just mentioned,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
how do they progress similarly
or differently than us here

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The commonality that we come
across is most civilizations,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
really depending on aggression
levels, to be quite honest,

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
either end up on a fork
of one of two paths,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
which is either they really
quickly learn to cooperate

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
and work together as
a people, as a group,

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
as a society collectively,
or they don't.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that don't have
to have a moment of truth

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
where either they change
their ways of not cooperating

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and working together and
start cooperating and working

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
together or, bye, they can
kiss their civilization goodbye

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and start over.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It is because of their
understanding of this process

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and having watched it occur in
other worlds many, many times

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the process
that they went through

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
to know that it's like letting
a child try and figure out

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
how to drive a car
by themselves, right?

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So their main goal is to try
and help us not wreck a car

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.020 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
how to drive yet.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there any significant
major points in their history

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
where their civilization
was made or broken?

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
In their case, it was
environmental pollution,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:90%
industrial pollution.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So they, obviously,
found industrialization,

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
computerization,
information in a similar way

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and had a lot of unclean
burning fossil fuels

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and other things similar
to what we have problems

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
with and reached a critical
point of near destruction

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:90%
of their ecosystem.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, someone came along
and helped them sort it out.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.475 align:middle line:84%
And so they felt grateful and
obligated to do the same thing

00:18:55.475 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, it
was nice that someone

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
came and helped us sort it out
before we destroyed ourselves.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we should do
that and feel we

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.500 align:middle line:84%
can extend the karmic gratitude
to other civilizations

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and help them not
destroy themselves.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Are all ET civilizations that
help develop humankind still

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:84%
here or have they departed and
left it to some other species?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of
that is that there

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
are no less than--
probably many more so

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:84%
than-- a couple of dozen
species of which we

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
have definitive genetic
markers in our DNA pool.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that we've had one
creator, two creators, three

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:90%
creators.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's more like we had one
here on the timeline and then

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
another one here and
then another one here

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:54.318 align:middle line:84%
and another one here as we go
down the timeline so that--

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Just not so much they said--

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.643 align:middle line:84%
they pulled away-- oh,
we're done with this.

00:19:57.643 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just someone
was always there

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to maybe pick this
up and keep moving.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where it gets,
actually, a little weirder.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
You have in some cases where
very organized and very

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
deliberate, scientific, planning
species came down to tinker.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You have other situations
where someone just wandered

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
into the neighborhood, found
out that the locals were

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
willing to give them free food
and free stuff for a minute

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and worship them as gods, and
they stuck around for a while.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And they made some babies.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:90%
And they mixed their DNA.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And then they left.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh,
crap, we're out of here.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to be
responsible for this.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And then they left.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a singular way
of existing or intention.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:84%
There's smart, organized,
scientific people that

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.330 align:middle line:90%
show up to sort things out.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
wanderers who happen

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
to be following through and
stopped for a minute when

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
no one else was
taking care of it

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and just decided to add
their genetic distinction

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:90%
to the pool.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And we get that.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a "clusterfudge,"
but not "fudge."

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think there is
tinkering going on right now

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:90%
in this moment of history?

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And there will be forever.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't foresee a time--

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe
that's a positive thing?

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Are we being--

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It can go either way.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>> --being upgraded
or downgraded?

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It can go either way.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I would like to think that
we're moving and motoring

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in a direction that
is towards upgrading.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But as a neutral technology,
it can be used either way.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think we should want
to do everything in our power

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that those
who are in control of that

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:84%
want to do it for our
benefit and our upliftment,

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and not the other way around.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's inevitable.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going
to see a stage for thousands

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
or thousands of
years where we're not

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
going to be tinkering
with our DNA

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:90%
or having our DNA tinkered with.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
constant for a long time.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, let's just--
fingers crossed--

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
hope that the people who
are in charge of that

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.457 align:middle line:84%
are better minded than
those who would do us harm

00:22:06.457 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:90%
and ill through that technology.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it just the
extraterrestrials or the humans

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials?

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's both, for sure.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials had
the technology before we did.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as we got
it, we're like, OK,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:90%
what can we do with this?

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
How can we start tinkering
and messing with our own DNA?

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
How can we evolve ourselves in
a conscious, thoughtful, focused

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:90%
way?

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You may have seen
the "Dawn of Man,"

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
where it shows the monkey
turning into the Cro-Magnon

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
People now are saying that we
are on a similar projectile

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:90%
of moving forward.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Where would we end up?

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if I am to understand
the larger demographic map that

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I have only looked
at a couple of times,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at a place in the
evolutionary tree in which Homo

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:84%
sapiens is going to fork off
into what could be five, six,

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
or seven different
Homo sapiens--

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.945 align:middle line:84%
sapiens, Homo sapiens,
Supra Homo sapien,

00:23:14.945 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:84%
whatever they want to come
up with to name them--

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapiens psionicus, I--

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have more
than one version of that.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.077 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to work
itself out in a weird way.

00:23:26.077 --> 00:23:27.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Will there be a
jump in there between,

00:23:27.785 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
like there was with
us in that diagram?

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I think what's
happened in the past is

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:90%
that you have these split-offs.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And what sometimes happened
are those branches come back

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:90%
together and re-merge.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:90%
And some of them fall off.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is
an opportunity where

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
the powers that can affect
this have said, alright

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:84%
let's have an experiment A, an
experiment B, an experiment C,

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
an experiment D, an
experiment E, an experiment

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
F, an experiment
G, and see which

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:90%
one dominates in 10 years.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you are
saying experiment.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, who is doing
this experiment?

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, it's a combination
of ETs, Galactic Senate,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and us and our own tinkering
and maneuvering for better

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.680 align:middle line:90%
or for ill.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:90%
We'll see how that goes.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHING]

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I really
have some of the highest

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
hopes by some of the things that
I see that we try to create.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I also have some of the
most disconcerting thoughts

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
of-- based on some of the
things that we try to create.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So I wish we could find some
healthier manifestation for how

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.890 align:middle line:90%
we want to create these things.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But some people just
want to Frankenstein

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:90%
monster whatever they can.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you envision
the potential of our future

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:90%
as a species and Earth itself?

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> More ideal than anything
that we have ever been able

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:90%
to conceive of.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So again, having seen
and been to a place

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:84%
where the rules of
civilization matter

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:90%
more than the rules of chaos--

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and right now, I think it's
fair to say we live on a world

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
where the rules of
chaos are stronger

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
than the rules of civilization.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Unfortunately, yes.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Unfortunately.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:84%
When that changes,
then everything

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to
fundamentally change.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:84%
When you change infrastructure
to the last dead end

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:84%
road, when you have
plumbing and electricity

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to the last dead
end road, when you

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
have schools and hospitals to
the last dead end road, right?

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
That's when civilization
extends everywhere.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And when all of those
things extend everywhere,

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
then everyone's a
participant in civilization.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
know how I can try

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
to describe the change
in the world that

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:90%
would come from that--

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and that the shifting in
global psionic consciousness

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
of reducing, oh,
I don't know, 90%

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:84%
of the world's stress,
anxiety, fear, grief, sorrow,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and despair just by patching
up the holes in civilization--

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that changes a world
because it changes not just

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:90%
the way people live--

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:84%
changes the way
they think, the way

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
they feel, the way they react,
the way they interact, and what

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:84%
value they feel is put on them
and the things around them.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we know for fact
is when civic citizens--

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
it's understood to them
through the rules and actions

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:84%
of civilization
that they have value

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
so that civic citizens
can also exchange

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:90%
that civilization has value.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
When that relationship is
tight, civilization thrives.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:84%
When that breaks down,
civilization crumbles.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And we are seeing the
breakdown of civic order

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and responsibility,
civic responsibility,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and that both of
those entities can

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
see that there is genuine
care and respect of each other

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
so that there can be
mutual functionality.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Without it, you have
this dysfunctional mess.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's fixable.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's repairable.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's just by fixing the
infrastructure parts of it that

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
changes the interaction between
civic citizens and civilization

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and civic government at large,
which just changes everything.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
The domino effect of that equals
everything frickin' changes

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like you're
talking about a project.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that we're talking

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
about a one-world movement,
one-world political setup,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:90%
a one-world military?

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And if so, why would we be
going in that direction?

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And who's in charge of that?

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So whether people
like this idea or not,

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:84%
the truth is there is not a
successful planet in our galaxy

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:84%
that has 183 countries and
183 governments and 183 legal

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
systems and 183 court
systems and 183 currencies.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:90%
That number changes.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:90%
It might not be 183.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we get it.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's a bunch.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Every successful world in
our galaxy at some point

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.137 align:middle line:84%
has one system of
government and one currency.

00:28:35.137 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that there
are some people who think

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.768 align:middle line:90%
that this is a very bad thing.

00:28:38.768 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
there are some people

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that I'm never going to
convince that it's a good thing.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.940 align:middle line:84%
What I can say is
that, again, there's

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
no successful civilized
world that doesn't do that.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And an evil authoritarian might
also want a globalized system.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It works for them.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But the good guys might also
want a globalized system

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's the most easy
to make sure that it's

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:90%
fair and regulated, right?

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to regulate
a planet that has, again,

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
almost 200 systems,
you're trying

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.478 align:middle line:84%
to tinker with 200 little
things to make sure

00:29:22.478 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that everyone's needs are
met when you really just want

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to go, can we just have
one system for this,

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:84%
because then we can reach
everybody with that?

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You can actually reach everybody
with a singular system.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And a singular currency
also balances out

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:84%
this disparity between the super
wealthy and the super poor.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is also a point where
I know some people are never

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:84%
going to agree with
my point of view

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:84%
because they think
that they should

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
be able to be ridiculously
wealthy billionaires.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it would
eliminate ridiculously

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:90%
wealthy billionaires.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It would just turn what
is an economical inverse

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:84%
pyramid, where all of
the wealth is at the top

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
at the bottom,

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's how civilizations
collapse-- this doesn't work.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:90%
This works better.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You just need to balance
this out a little bit.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And the part that
really blows my mind

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.400 align:middle line:84%
that I can't seem to
convey enough to people

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:84%
is that for people who
are at the top of that

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:84%
who think they're going
to lose, no, you're not.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to lose.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to give
up this much of this much

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:84%
so the world doesn't
collapse under your feet.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's worth the price.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's no system
where that inversion

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:90%
of economics and wealth works.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:90%
So at some point--

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about a level,
communist playing field.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:46.685 align:middle line:90%
>> What will it take?

00:30:46.685 --> 00:30:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not what
we're talking about.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.117 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking
about something

00:30:49.117 --> 00:30:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that's more fair than the
incredibly unfair, inequitable

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:90%
system that we currently have.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you think
it'll take for that transition

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.175 align:middle line:84%
to move into this new
world order, I'll say?

00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, I think it brings
us right back to invasion

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
scenarios and
disclosure scenarios.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>> To bring us together?

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> By force.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that have to
bring everybody together

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:84%
or, again, we're
going to crumble.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So I think whatever brings
us together, whatever gets us

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:84%
on the same page, whatever
gets us solving the same 10

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
logical, clear,
truthful problems is

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:90%
what will lead us to being OK.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
Ronald Reagan who

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.510 align:middle line:84%
said that if there was an
extraterrestrial threat abroad

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:84%
from space-- how our
differences would just go away

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and we'd work
together as a team.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In theory, it
can actually work.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just get
everybody on the same page

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:84%
to solve those problems
instead of bicker

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:84%
about 20 other things
that aren't the problem,

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:90%
then we can do it.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.790 align:middle line:90%
We can totally do it.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We're just so distracted,
so confused, so polarized

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a
position where you

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:90%
can't solve problems that way.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't solve
problems when everyone's

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
screaming and throwing
rocks at each other.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
If you can't sit
down at a table,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.532 align:middle line:84%
if you can't write down
on a piece of paper,

00:32:08.532 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to solve anything.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So at some point, we
just have to, or else.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there's a
lot of machinations moving it

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:84%
in a direction where the choice
isn't going to be "either, or."

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.630 align:middle line:84%
The choice is
going to be, oh, we

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:90%
have to pick working together.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.935 align:middle line:84%
That's just the choice
we have to make.

00:32:27.935 --> 00:32:28.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:28.735 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, to make it happen.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
mean it's not going

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to be difficult and complicated
and that there aren't

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
some people that are going
to dig in their heels

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.227 align:middle line:84%
and make it more
difficult and complicated.

00:32:38.227 --> 00:32:39.310 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But that's not a reason
not to change the world.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it looks like, Randy,
we do have quite the path ahead

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think your point on
having more of an open mind

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and awareness for
everyone on the planet

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:90%
would greatly help everybody.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Randy,
for being on the show.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me here.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:90%

Until next time.
