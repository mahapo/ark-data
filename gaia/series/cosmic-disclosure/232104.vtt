>> SÉBASTIEN MARTIN:
They buried his body,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and then they buried the
whole site, the whole site,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.110 align:middle line:90%
22 square miles of dirt.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:84%
But no one knows
exactly how they did it.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.850 align:middle line:84%
A short Grey alien with
a big head on a wall

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:84%

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
lit, but it was not

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:84%
lit by torches or
artificial lights.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It was lit by an unusual,
everlasting green light that was

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:90%
like a flame, a green flame.

I'm Josh Golembeske, MUFON field
investigator and your guest host

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Sébastien, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, thank you
very much for having me again.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How did you find out
about this remarkable story

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
about Emperor Qin
and the mausoleum?

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:90%
And how did you hear about it?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And who is Emperor Qin too?

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:10%
>> MARTIN: Yes, well, he was
the first emperor of China.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.615 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the name China came
from his name, Qi, Chi, China.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:10%
So he basically
became the major force

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:10%
that consolidated all
the people of China

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:10%
together to make it one country.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And this was around 200 BC.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, all
the people of China

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
were fighting each
other for territory,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't have
an actual structure.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So Emperor Qin created a
structure for the country,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
came up with a new
monetary system,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.685 align:middle line:90%
came up with a crossbow idea.

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Interesting.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So he came up with a
new feat of engineering that no

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:90%
one else ever seen before.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Or the languages that were used
in China then were all dialects.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.625 align:middle line:84%
And he formed a unified
language for the whole country.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:23.792 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Very important prominent
historical figure.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Very, very important.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:84%
He died of mercury poisoning
because he believed that mercury

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%
was making him immortal.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So he kept drinking elixirs of
base of mercury and other metals

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that,
that basically killed him

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 48 years old.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So he was pretty
young when he died.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But he started the mausoleum,
the mausoleum early

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
on because I think it
took about 37 years

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:90%
to build in his lifetime.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So he knew that eventually,
he was going to die,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and the mausoleum
was going to be

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
his resting place with
his concubines, pretty

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
much everybody he knew,
even his generals.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The mausoleum was created in
a swamp, so it was very wet.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And they had to create a
drainage system all around it.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But Emperor Qin
chose that location.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why he
chose that location

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
was to do with the
cardinal points heading

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:90%
towards the Orion star system.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So nobody knew why at the
time, but the Egyptians

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:90%
believed the same thing.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
They also orientated their
pyramids towards the Orion star

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
system as well.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.755 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So this mausoleum
was constructed in a swamp,

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
which is bizarre, but it makes
sense now because it was aligned

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.895 align:middle line:90%
with the stars.

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:52.695 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And this mausoleum is
famous for the Terracotta Army,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes, the
Terracotta soldiers,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
they were built to be exactly
the same height as a regular

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:90%
soldier in those days.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And they each had
different faces.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
They were all basically painted
over to look like the armies.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I think they were like over
8,000 to 10,000 soldiers.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
them got smashed.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really knows this.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But when they were
buried underground,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
pillagers decided to go in
and break off all the statues

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:90%
during the next dynasty.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So right after the Qin dynasty,
the new dynasty took it over.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they knew somehow
that those Terracotta soldiers

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.925 align:middle line:84%
were there, and they
decided to smash them all.

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Smash them or steal
them and sell them kind

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:90%
of thing?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: No, just smash them.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Just smash them.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: They were made
of terracotta or clay,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:90%
so they had no value in them.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So they
just smashed them.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.933 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That makes sense.

00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: They didn't want
to leave any trace almost

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:90%
of the emperor.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But they could not go into
the tomb of the Emperor Qin

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
because, one, it
was booby trapped.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Two, they had heavy
mercury inside it,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:84%
which is where we
know from radars,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and we can go deep
inside the earth

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
to see that there is
an actual river system

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
to mimic all the rivers of
China within that mausoleum.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.525 align:middle line:84%
The mausoleum is over
22 square miles big.

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.006 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's--

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:25.174 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It's massive.

00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: --a lot Bigger than I
had in my head for some reason.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And there were
two access points.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So today, the archaeologists
would tell you

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:90%
nobody has gone in.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has been able
to investigate and see

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
what's inside because
it's too dangerous, one.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
the technology somehow

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to go in because they are
afraid of destroying evidence.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So to this point,
no one has opened it.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:90%
It's been shut down.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Officially speaking--

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Officially, right.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.632 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Officially
speaking, no one opened it,

00:05:55.632 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:90%
but the army was there.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.363 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So you have to
realize that when it was first

00:05:59.363 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:84%
discovered, the most solemn
and especially the Terracotta

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
soldiers, the whole site
was buried, the whole site.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.635 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: All 20 miles.

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:07.552 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Everything.

00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything was buried, including
the Terracotta soldiers,

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:90%
including the mausoleum.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing sticking out.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:90%
It was basically all buried.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a farmer who
decided to plow his field

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and came across the first
Terracotta soldier statue--

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Wow, that's
quite a moment.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: --while
plowing his field.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: All right.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Sébastien, so the mercury
aspect is interesting

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.913 align:middle line:84%
because you mentioned before
that the emperor used mercury

00:06:27.913 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
in his life, and
he thought it had

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:90%
some sort of anti-aging thing.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.927 align:middle line:84%
And then the mausoleum itself
had rivers made of mercury or--

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: That's correct.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: --rivers of mercury?

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Yes, pure mercury, to the
point that even today we

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:84%
realize that the
mercury is leaching out

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:90%
outside the mausoleum.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So they know that there
is a very high evidence

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
of high dosage of mercury
inside the mausoleum.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
but they actually

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
had a very complex system
that still to this day,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:90%
there is a flow in those rivers.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So those rivers are flowing
mercury inside the mausoleum

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%
still to this day.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
It's been ongoing,
flowing rivers

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and to mimic all
the rivers of China.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
you use mercury

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
is because it was still
a symbol of the afterlife

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and also to mimic the other
side-- the other world.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
He duplicated the whole
of China inside his tomb

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:90%
because this was his afterlife.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
What I know of from the people
I interacted with in China

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:84%
is that one person
in particular,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
was a high ranking officer in
the Chinese army, was invited--

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
once he retired, he was
invited by one of his friends

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:84%
back in 1999 to go
inside the mausoleum.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And when he said to me that
he went inside the mausoleum

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.450 align:middle line:84%
with his friends,
they were wearing

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.837 align:middle line:84%
gas masks because of the heavy
chemicals from the mercury.

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: From the mercury, yeah.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And all the
booby traps were gone.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So there were two access
points to go to the mausoleum.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
He went to one of them that
is not known to the public.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And because obviously, it's
according to knowledge,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:90%
no one has been inside.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But the whole army was on
site, and they were protecting

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:90%
the sites from the public.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, it
was closed to the public

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:84%
for either renovation,
whatever excuses they found.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.405 align:middle line:90%
But the army went in in 1999.

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:25.205 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: 1999?

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Before we go any further,
why was it buried?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Is that just natural, or are
they purposely buried it?

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: No, it
was purposely buried.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Any site, especially
for him, the Emperor Qin

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
knew how barbaric
other people would be,

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:90%
especially the next dynasty.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of leaders,
people of wealth and power

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:90%
within China.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:90%
And he was fighting them all.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So when he became a leader,
he still had enemies.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
He was still very
young when he died.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:90%
So he still had living enemies.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
make sure that when

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
he died that his sites
would never be found.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:84%
This is like leading up to be
the next Indiana Jones movie.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So Chen is there in the
late '90s with the army.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:84%
The first time he's going to
go in, what did he experience?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.613 align:middle line:84%
What are all the surprising
or unexpected things

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:12.655 align:middle line:90%
that he witnessed inside?

00:09:12.655 --> 00:09:14.738 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, first of
all, it's the sheer size

00:09:14.738 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
of the mausoleum that he
described with all the paintings

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
or the colors inside and the
fact that everything was lit.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was not lit by
torches or artificial light.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It was lit by an unusual,
everlasting green light that

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:84%
was like a flame,
a green flame that

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
was emanating from
the mausoleum,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and it was lighting
up the whole area.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Like one flame.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: No, no, no.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Many, many--

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Many flames.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So that
you can imagine, like,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds of
torches all around illuminating

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the whole area for
that space that, like,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of like 52
football fields, it's massive.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
This was the alien
technology 100%.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.943 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So that's where
it all started for him.

00:09:59.943 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
When he first saw those
candles lighting up

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in a pale green flame, he could
not understand what those were.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And he asked, and his
friend, the soldier

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
said those flames were
there when you arrived.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So they've been like
this, illuminating

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.803 align:middle line:90%
that space for all this time.

00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:21.345 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Wow, that
is so fascinating.

00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: And it never stopped.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And still to this day, I think
they probably left them there.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want to disturb it.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah, I
wouldn't touch that.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: But what he explained
as well is that when he went

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
through the tunnel, they
had massive crossbows,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
so huge crossbows in the
entryway with basically was

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:84%
impaling anybody
who was coming in.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So like with long
sticks and enough

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to kill like 10
people in one shot.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: So a booby trap.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: One of
them, yes, yes.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like the
army already went in.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't aware.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Chen wasn't aware of what
went on because he was already

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.585 align:middle line:90%
retired from the army.

00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was invited
by his friends

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to have a look because
they just opened it.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So when he went in, he was told
that obviously a lot of work

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
has gone through to go
through this passageway.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And some people
died, some people,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
because they were
trying to get in.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, they
were just determined

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:90%
to go in and check it out.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when they went
in, that's when it really

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:90%
changed everything for him.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
He basically
described the ceiling

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
with stars that
were illuminating.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
There were light, bright,
almost like phosphorous looking.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And he could recognize
some star systems

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.705 align:middle line:84%
on the ceiling and some
that were not known to man.

00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's interesting.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Did they figure out what these--

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: They still
don't know what those are.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And Orion is one
of them, funnily enough.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I believe
there was the Big

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Dipper and all of these things.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So those known
constellations were seen.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But again, there were
other constellations

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.705 align:middle line:84%
found on the ceiling that
even scientists today

00:12:01.705 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:90%
do not know what they mean.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So these constellations,
they didn't recognize,

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
those are separate
from the Orion system.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, yes.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.645 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: There was a
connection to the Orion.

00:12:10.645 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:84%
We saw those star systems
and then separate star

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.253 align:middle line:90%
systems where they had no idea.

00:12:14.253 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: That's correct.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Just looked
completely foreign.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.405 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And they
look very distinctive.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
You could see that
there was almost

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.890 align:middle line:84%
like a space between
each constellations

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to really identify
them and separate them.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So everything was
detached on the ceiling

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to make it a very clear
picture in the sky of very

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
specific points that
were put together

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to make it look like the
star systems we know of

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and the constellations we know
of with the equal distance

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
between each star that
we have in the sky today.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So they already
had that knowledge

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.825 align:middle line:84%
to display it on the
ceiling in that chamber.

00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So these constellations
they are seeing on the ceiling,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
some of them seem like it's from
our perspective on Earth looking

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: That's right.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Could it be
possible that the ones they

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
didn't recognize are from
another solar system,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:84%
looking towards us or
looking somewhere else?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's possible that,
let's say, alien beings

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
created those maps
for the Qin emperor

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to create on that ceiling that
they gave them coordinates

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:90%
and from their perspective.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So while from Earth, we
recognize those constellations,

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
it is possible that from a
viewpoint of the Orion star

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
systems, for
example, looking out,

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
you may be able to see
constellations or star systems

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:90%
that we can't see from Earth.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's from their
perspective instead of being

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:90%
from the human perspective.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, got it, got it.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for sure,
but it's possible.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Right.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.162 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: All right,
let's keep going.

00:13:46.162 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So they're exploring
this giant structure.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:90%
They're moving on.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They eventually get
to the king's chamber,

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.145 align:middle line:84%
where there's mercury rivers
that mimic the rivers of China.

00:13:57.145 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
What else is going
on-- what else do

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:84%
you want to point out that
happened in the king's chamber?

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.795 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:14:01.795 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So basically you walk
through this chamber,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:84%
you have to go
from the top down.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So you go through the
stairways made out of clay,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and then you go down, and then
you just get to this chamber

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.065 align:middle line:90%
that's--

00:14:14.065 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
the actual emperor's
mausoleum or chamber

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:84%
is smaller than
the 22 square miles

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:84%
complex, because it's
just an isolated chamber

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.722 align:middle line:90%
just for the emperor.

00:14:25.722 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's no other dead
bodies in there, just himself

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
in his tomb and then
all the artifacts

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
around the chamber with
all these lighting candles.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the mausoleum itself or
the resting place of the emperor

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:90%
is still huge.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.725 align:middle line:84%
It's still massive, but the
whole complex is bigger.

00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: But it's subterranean.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:48.765 align:middle line:90%
So you go down--

00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It's subterranean.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: --the stairways, and
you keep getting lower and lower

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.875 align:middle line:90%
till you get to the chamber.

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:53.083 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, that's right.

00:14:53.083 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You keep going down, down
until you reach the chamber.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And then everything is dried.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no leakage from
water or nothing else.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But within the chamber,
this is where you

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:90%
see all these flowing rivers.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So the whole
landscape of China has

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
been reshaped around the
tomb of the emperor--

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So only in that room,
only in that room is the--

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Only in that room
is where the flowing mercury is

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:90%
located.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the flowing
mercury with that flowing

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:84%
river with nobody
knows still what's

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism of
making that river

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:90%
flow through the whole chamber.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:90%
That nobody knows.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the ceiling is so
vast that they could only

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:84%
recognize certain
constellations and star

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:90%
systems that we know of.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:84%
But that went further
into weirdness

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
when they saw the tomb of the
emperor and was well decorated.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.145 align:middle line:84%
He had lots of jars,
potteries around it.

00:15:49.145 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
The point that the
friend said to him

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
was, we found some
jars with food in them,

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:90%
or dried foods and seeds.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.525 align:middle line:84%
And one of those seeds
were actually tomato seeds.

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Now tomato seeds were not
introduced to the world until

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.306 align:middle line:90%
the 1500s.

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: That's confusing.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And those seeds
were inside the mausoleum.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.083 align:middle line:84%
And they analyzed those
seeds, and they realized

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:17.125 align:middle line:90%
that they came from Peru.

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, let me
get this straight.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.235 align:middle line:84%
There was tomato seeds from
Peru inside the chamber.

00:16:24.235 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What was
the speculation?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:90%
What did they say about that?

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:90%
What's the answer?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:90%
How did it get there?

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes, so they
analyzed the seeds.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:84%
They obviously went
through machines

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and were able to determine that
those seeds came from Peru.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And obviously in Peru, they
had tomatoes and tomato seeds.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But the question
is, how did they

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:90%
bring them from there to China?

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So somehow Peru
and China were interacting

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:90%
potentially.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Or are you saying something
a little more interesting?

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, if you think
about the Nazca lines in Peru

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and how they have those
mountains completely shaved off

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
with landing strips, and they
have a 50 long kilometer plateau

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.883 align:middle line:90%
with different symbols.

00:17:05.883 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we know that this
was involving alien technology

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that the
beings involved at Nazca

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:84%
were also in communications
with the Emperor Qin.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.705 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not
speculation, by the way.

00:17:21.705 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
This is based on
what Chen told me,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that he saw a short gray
alien with a big head

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
on a wall being depicted
looking at Emperor Qin.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So they were facing
each other on that wall.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.472 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Inside his chamber.

00:17:37.472 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Inside the
chamber in the mausoleum.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So when Chen looked
at the adjacent wall,

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
there was basically a
depiction of the Emperor

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Qin with a short Grey alien
who was like 4 to 5 feet tall.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And he had a big head, a
bigger head than a human being.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And he had silted eyes.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:84%
He looked like he was in
a conversation with him.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.115 align:middle line:84%
But that's what was
depicted on the wall.

00:18:04.115 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:90%
And that shocked him.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this
was the main reason why

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese government
decided to keep it quiet

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and do not wish to reveal this
information to the public.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:16.683 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: And yeah.

00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, OK, OK, OK.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a big reveal.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.997 align:middle line:84%
So classic Grey alien,
you say a big head.

00:18:21.997 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:84%
The Grey aliens always
big with giant heads.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.913 align:middle line:84%
Slanted eyes, you mean the
classic big black eyes.

00:18:25.913 --> 00:18:26.872 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, mm-hmm.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:29.662 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And you mentioned
that the Grey alien was about 4

00:18:29.662 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 feet tall.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Was this like a
life size depiction

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:84%
of a real event or
potential real event?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Exactly, yes.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:90%
And because the Emperor Qin's--

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
his size was already, I
believe, mentioned in the books.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:90%
So they knew how tall he was.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:90%
I think he was maybe 5 feet 6.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And that alien was probably
more like 4 feet 5.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So this is like a
hieroglyphic on the wall,

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:90%
etched into the wall.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.295 align:middle line:84%
Just be clear about the
artwork for a second.

00:19:00.295 --> 00:19:01.095 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:19:01.095 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was painted.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the Emperor
Qin was dressed up

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:90%
in ceremonial clothing.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Grey alien
had no clothing on.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:90%
He was just a Grey alien.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was painted in
a gray colored format.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So Qin was like,
colorful, like they--

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.852 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yes, he
was in full color.

00:19:20.852 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
He was all painted
like a cartoon.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And the Grey alien was also
painted with the gray colors

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:90%
and the black eyes.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.585 align:middle line:84%
So he was depicted exactly
how it looked like.

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
biggest shock to Chen

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.300 align:middle line:84%
when he saw those
depictions, knowing

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that everything in this room
didn't make any sense to him.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything was new.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Obviously he was able to
understand that those seeds are

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:90%
not from here.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:90%
They were from Peru.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
The weaponry that they found
inside were not crossbows

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:90%
and archers stuff like.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:90%
There were no bows and arrows.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They were like alien
technologies inside,

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
laser beams weapons inside the
mausoleum that were lying there.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And some of them were big.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:84%
He described them as being
maybe like 8 feet tall and pure

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:90%
metallic.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea what the
technology was, how it was used.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
There was no manual
that came with it,

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
but it was laying down on
the ground basically still

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
on display, almost
like a museum.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So it was still up the
ground-- above ground.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.335 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Oh, so not
just left on the floor--

00:20:32.335 --> 00:20:34.877 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It was left on the
floor, but it was on the floor,

00:20:34.877 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
basically on display, like,
exactly without any notations,

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:90%
He do not explain what it was.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Same as the seeds,
nothing was explained.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
It was just basically clay
pots with seeds inside.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: How did you
know it was a laser?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain?

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Was it a gun?

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Did it have a trigger?

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.265 align:middle line:90%
Like explain.

00:20:52.265 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Yeah, this is
what Chen described it as.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
He said you had some
bluish coloring to it.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
It was very clear,
like metal, very shiny.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And to him, he said it looked
like a laser beam of some sort,

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.065 align:middle line:84%
or you could shoot
at, from or something.

00:21:10.065 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
How it was activated
or used was unknown.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
They just knew
that someone could

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.340 align:middle line:84%
have held this piece of
equipment that was 8 feet long--

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah, I was going
to say 8 feet tall, that's--

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: 8 feet long.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was designed like
someone could lift it--

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Like one person.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: --and shoot from it.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Not one person.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:24.667 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:24.885 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:27.065 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: But they
believe this was a weapon.

00:21:27.065 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And he never strayed
away from that thought.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
I questioned him on,

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.467 align:middle line:84%
but he basically said I
was told this was a weapon.

00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Did they
just leave it there?

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine the
government took it and tried

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:90%
to reverse engineer it.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's
very interesting.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is,
Chen was invited

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
as soon as the chamber
was opened to the army.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.955 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have
much time to do a lot.

00:21:52.955 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They already were
able to analyze

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the seeds on site with the
equipment that they had.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So that was quickly done.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:84%
The army didn't have time
to raid the whole place,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and they just were basically
just in the process of doing it.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It was so fresh
that just happened.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Like the tomb basically was
just made open to the army.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And Chen was invited
by his friend.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Only very few people already
saw the chamber itself.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So they had no time to
really do much then there.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.245 align:middle line:90%
I bet it's not there anymore.

00:22:23.245 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: No, probably not.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.892 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So the big takeaways
in the chamber were this 8-foot

00:22:27.892 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
long potential laser weapon,
this depiction between Emperor

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Qin and a Grey alien.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.246 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: And then I think
the mercury is also amazing,

00:22:37.246 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:90%
incredible.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.932 align:middle line:84%
So is there anything
else about the chamber

00:22:39.932 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
point out that was--

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: The flame, so the
green flame that was going

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
the everlasting flame, nobody
knew what was the component

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
They tried to analyze
the flame, but they

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.835 align:middle line:84%
couldn't find out where it
came from or what was made of.

00:22:58.835 --> 00:22:59.635 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really?

00:22:59.635 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: No.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And they could not
even show it off.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They could not
close put something

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
like a tight lid over it
and then make it disappear.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:90%
It was everlasting.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.928 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So they could not
contain it with the technology

00:23:13.928 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:90%
that they had then.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.435 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they left them
there, because they could not

00:23:17.435 --> 00:23:18.235 align:middle line:90%
contain it.

00:23:18.235 --> 00:23:20.665 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Sébastien, this is
like an incredible facility,

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:21.465 align:middle line:90%
this mausoleum.

00:23:21.465 --> 00:23:22.265 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:23:22.265 --> 00:23:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: The engineering feats
alone seem incredible for that

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:90%
time period.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: It was.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.673 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What do you
have to say about that?

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, obviously they
came up with a new design made

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
out of clay, which was new
structures for those days, like,

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:84%
previous mausoleums for
previous leaders within China,

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and there were some.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
They buried them in dirt
and very basic material.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was not elaborate enough.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Qin had the thought of one
choosing a very swampy area

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:84%
underground to be
completely buried

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and disappearing from the
surface of this world,

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:84%
knowing that there was
rivers and water that

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:90%
was going towards it.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So they had to basically change
the shape of the adjacent land

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:90%
to create the mausoleum.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So they completely
changed the way

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:84%
the rivers were flowing
around the mausoleums

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
before they even
started the work.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: And that was
a huge feat on its own.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So while they put
clay pipes and they

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:35.240 align:middle line:84%
were able to divert swampy
water to go around the mausoleum

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.075 align:middle line:84%
and to not go inside, that alone
was a huge feat of engineering.

00:24:40.075 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Well, it sounds like
there's definitely ET tech going

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:84%
on with the engineering of this,
but also just human ingenuity.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:90%
The China--

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: They didn't
have the knowledge then.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have that knowledge.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Really?

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:49.723 align:middle line:90%
Even the landscape--

00:24:49.723 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: That was all new.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Everything was new.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.095 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew where it came from.

00:24:53.095 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: This
was completely new.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
That was not something that was
taken from previous generations.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
They literally designed
something completely new

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
coming out of nowhere,
the same way as like Qin

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
created so many new things and
novel things for his country.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows exactly
why he did it,

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.832 align:middle line:84%
why he wanted to create
a unified language

00:25:15.832 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:90%
for the whole of China.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: He was--

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.777 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: He knew something
that other people didn't.

00:25:20.777 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, it's interesting.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So everything was
designed around the knowledge

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.612 align:middle line:84%
of something greater than
the knowledge of those days.

00:25:27.612 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Well, I guess what
I'm getting at is it seems like

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.235 align:middle line:84%
still humans built it, but they
had knowledge that was beyond

00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:34.035 align:middle line:90%
human.

00:25:34.035 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Does that make sense?

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.775 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes, completely.

00:25:36.775 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole site is
designed exactly the way

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids of
Egypt were designed,

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.922 align:middle line:84%
but on a much larger
scale, much larger.

00:25:43.922 --> 00:25:45.505 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Yeah, 22
miles is obviously--

00:25:45.505 --> 00:25:46.526 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yeah 22 square miles.

00:25:46.526 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: This is much,
much larger than the pyramids

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:90%
of Egypt.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Anything on that level
was a feat of engineering.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:26:01.165 align:middle line:84%
And also the way they buried the
whole site, nobody knows how,

00:26:01.165 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
how they were able to bury
the whole site under dirt

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.170 align:middle line:90%
in such a short period of time.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What do you mean,
short period of time?

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: Well, they
basically when he died,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
when the emperor died,
they buried his body.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they buried the
whole site, the whole site,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:90%
22 square miles of dirt.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But no one knows
exactly how they did it.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I need some
clarity on something.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is all coming from a
gentleman named Chen, right?

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.035 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So there's more going
on here than a burial chamber.

00:26:29.035 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: Yes.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.372 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What can
you say about that?

00:26:31.372 --> 00:26:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: So my belief, based
on what I heard and what I was

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
able to intuitively
know about this place,

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.506 align:middle line:84%
was that Emperor Qin, while
interacting with the Grey

00:26:41.506 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
aliens, was promised
that in the afterlife,

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:84%
this chamber was basically
acting as a gateway for him

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to go into this world,
go into Orion, perhaps.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So he could go there with his
conquering army to go to Orion

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and meet with the Grey
aliens in the afterlife,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:90%
but not as a human form.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.615 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:27:03.615 --> 00:27:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: That's
what I believe.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.313 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this whole place
was designed for that purpose.

00:27:07.313 --> 00:27:08.965 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: But you
believe that or that--

00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I believe that, yes.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Chen said that or--

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: No, he
didn't say that.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: --that's more your
opinion on the whole setup.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: I believe that
based on my intuition,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
based on what I was able to
do to connect to this place,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that seems right to me that he
was actually such in contact

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.715 align:middle line:84%
with those beings, that he just
wanted to go there and visit it,

00:27:25.715 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:84%
because he had no
time in his lifetime.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: What did Chen say
specifically about the ET

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
on the wall and its
relation to Emperor Qin.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: He was so shocked.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And he got scared
at the same time.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:84%
He said to me that
if that ever came out

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
or if his name ever was known,
he could be in big trouble

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:90%
even today.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Do we think that the
mausoleum will ever be fully

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.045 align:middle line:84%
excavated and
publicly available?

00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: I don't know.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.935 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe so.

00:27:56.935 --> 00:28:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Not because I think the
government of China--

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
the Communist Party
really believe

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that they have their
own history and ways

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of showing the people of China,
and it's very regimented.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So if they go astray and
start talking about aliens,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.595 align:middle line:84%
it won't go well with the
Communist Party of China.

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: It doesn't really
coincide with their belief

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:90%
systems as well.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.513 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:20.513 --> 00:28:23.855 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTIN: They don't want
to go into new religions

00:28:23.855 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:90%
because of that.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So they are very much in
line with one religion.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to put away
other types of religions

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.925 align:middle line:84%
that could be perceived as
extreme or extreme religions.

00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think this would be a
huge turning point for people

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.330 align:middle line:84%
starting questioning even
the existence of the origin

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:90%
of the Chinese population.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So therefore I believe
that this, the mausoleum

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:90%
will always remain buried.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.215 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that they
will open it to the public

00:28:56.215 --> 00:28:57.015 align:middle line:90%
anytime soon.

00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:57.815 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Wow.

00:28:57.815 --> 00:29:01.052 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sébastien, I could
talk to you all day.

00:29:01.052 --> 00:29:02.260 align:middle line:90%
This was amazing information.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, thank you
for coming forward

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:84%
with this story and everything
you've come forward with so far.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.905 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to
future conversations.

00:29:07.905 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTIN: All right.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.607 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you very
much again for having me.

00:29:10.607 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: My name
is Josh Golembeske.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
Cosmic Disclosure.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.
