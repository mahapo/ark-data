>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired Special Agent

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force office

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.615 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Today we're talking about
UFO events that remain

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:90%
mostly classified to this day.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There
are many incidents

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
that relate to UFOs and ETs
that have been classified.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, some of
these details have come out.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more about that.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's a number
of incidents that I knew of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and some I actually
investigated or was

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:90%
part of an investigation.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's bits and
pieces of these stories

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
or these incidents
that came out.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people that were
involved in these incidents

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
are now coming out
and talking about it.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:90%
But they're still classified.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And the military won't
declassify any of these things.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're trying to
do in the Disclosure Project,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
is getting these stories and
getting these incidents out

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:90%
into the public.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: And what happened at
Edwards Air Force base in 1980?

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: In 1980,
an SR-71 spy plane

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:10%
was flying from Edwards Air
Force Base out to Area 51

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:10%
for a test mission.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:10%
There was a new pilot on
board, pilot and a co-pilot,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:10%
and he was going through
some testing, training

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:10%
qualifications, or what they
call stand board evaluations.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, we took off from
Edwards Air Force Base.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:90%
The SR-71 got up to 65,000 feet.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was to be just a few--

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I think 27-minute flight
from Edwards to Area 51.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But as they reached
65,000 feet, they

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
encountered a UFO, a huge
UFO, as the pilot described it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
as being as large as
two football fields.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, this UFO was flying
around the aircraft.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got to understand
that the SR-71 is flying

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
straight at about
2,200 miles an hour,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and this UFO was
flying around it,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
making it look bad
for the pilots,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
thinking that
every time that UFO

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
came in front of it, the SR-71
was going to crash into it.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
This happened from the time they
reached 65 until they started

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:90%
their descent into Area 51.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were they ordered
just to keep that position?

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They notified the base.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:90%
They went on to secure channel.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
They were talking to
Edwards Air Force Base.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
They're talking on
a secure channel,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:90%
explaining what they're seeing.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
the ground controllers

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
told them to do was,
open your cameras,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:90%
and let's take some pictures.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
They took over 100 pictures
in that short time period.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they have advanced
cameras on board the SR-71.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But every time that UFO
got under the SR-71--

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Perfect.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --they took
a picture of it.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So they had this entire
UFO on camera, everything

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:90%
about the flying part of it.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Plus some people don't know, and
of course, the SR-71 no longer

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:90%
flies.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I think there's one that
still flies for NASA,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:90%
but they're obsolete now.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
information about the SR-71

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:90%
is not classified anymore.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:10%
But one of the things
that people didn't realize

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:10%
was not only did the
SR-71 collect photographs,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:10%
photographic
intelligence, they also

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:10%
could collect ELINT,
Electronic Intelligence.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's what they were doing.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:10%
They turned on their
ELINT collectors,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:10%
and the SIGINT collectors,
Signal Intelligent collectors,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:10%
their frequency collectors.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
So they had everything on.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:90%
All their spy equipment was on.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they were collecting
every bit of data

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:90%
that was coming from that UFO.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
the UFO flew away.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.757 align:middle line:84%
That's where I said we
landed it at Area 51.

00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's one
test drive I don't think

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
that pilot will ever forget.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we met him.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:90%
We met him at a UFO convention.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Wendelle Stevens knew him.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
He sat down, and he
told us this story.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of questions
that we threw at him,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
some of which he could answer
and some of which he couldn't.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:84%
But then we went out and tried
to get this through FOIA.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force admits the flight
number, the SR-71 tail number,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
was on that mission on
that particular day in 1980

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and the flight plan.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing
the flight plan

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
said it was from Edwards to
a classified location, which

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:90%
of course we know is Area 51.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing the
Air Force would say,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
any other details will
remain classified.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the FOIA information that
Wendelle Holmes shared with us.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So that incident, even
after 40-some years,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:90%
is still remaining classified.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And did he describe
that craft a little bit more

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:90%
in detail?

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
You said the size of
two football fields.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Was it a ball of light?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.972 align:middle line:90%
Was it saucer shaped?

00:05:48.972 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It was saucer shaped.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
The pilot who we spoke to
said it was saucer shaped.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:90%
It was thick.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a regular
saucer-shaped object.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It had a band in the
center that would light up

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.750 align:middle line:90%
at certain times.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It was flowing around the center
port of the saucer-shaped area.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And the band would light,
different colored lighting

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It was silvery colored.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's about
all they could see.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were seeing
it for the 20-some minutes

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
that it was in front of them.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But when the SR-71
landed, the first thing

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
the ground crews did was they
went and removed the cameras

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and removed the collection
pod for the SIGINT,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Signal Intelligence and
Electronic Intelligence.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, the question was,
did you guys see the photos?

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said, you
can't see the photos

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:90%
while they're being taken.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:10%
And we didn't have
the ability back

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:10%
in those days with the SR-71.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:90%
They had to be developed.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
They had to be sent
to a laboratory.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then we never
saw them again after that.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, you wouldn't
be, yeah, the pilot, either.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of
any other US bombers

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:90%
involved with ETs or UFOs?

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: >>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Another incident
happened in 1969,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
which is quite an amazing story,
because it involved the B-52.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:90%
The pilot sat there with us.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Wendelle Stevens and Robert
Dean and other people

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
were in the room
listening to the story.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
In 1969 in the
late '50s and '60s,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
the Strategic Air Command had
an operation called Chrome Dome.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They launched B-52s from SAC,
or Strategic Air Command bases,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
from around the world into the
skies with nuclear weapons.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were up there 24
hours a day, 365 days a year.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And the object was to be close
enough to the Soviet Union

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:84%
or to China to get
the first strike in.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
missions being launched

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:84%
from all the different SAC bases
and even some satellite bases

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
This particular mission
originated from KI Sawyer Air

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Force Base in Michigan.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The pilot had a
B-52, a B-52H model.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:90%
The serial number was 60-0058.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:90%
He remembered the serial number.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:90%
It was his plane.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:90%
He took off.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:84%
He had four Mark 28 nuclear
weapons, one megaton each.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:10%
And his mission was to fly
in a certain configuration

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:10%
near the Arctic Circle.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was to do this
for a 12-hour period.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
There was a relief crew
in the craft with him.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And they would be refueled,
I think two or three times

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.280 align:middle line:90%
during this mission.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
As they took off, they flew
towards their first waypoint,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:90%
which was near Hudson Bay.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:90%
There's two decks to a B-52.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The pilot and the co-pilot
sits up in the upper deck.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
In the lower deck is
the flight engineer,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the electronic warfare officer,
or the one that launches

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear weapons,
and a gunner.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, the gunner in
the old days would

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:90%
be in the back of the aircraft.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But the newer versions had
the gunner sitting down

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:90%
in a lower area of the aircraft.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
The flight engineer
radioed that there was

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:90%
an intruder on the aircraft.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:10%
The pilot told the copilot,
go down and figure out

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:10%
what's going on down there.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:90%
And so the copilot went down.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, every single crew
member on a B-52 is armed with

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.320 align:middle line:84%
a .38-caliber revolver for
survival purposes and any other

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:90%
reasons.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The copilot went down,
confronted the flight engineer,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and the flight engineer pointed
towards a walkway, or a crawl

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
space between the flight
engineer area and the bomb bay

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And so the copilot looked in
there and saw this entity.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:90%
He called it an entity.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:10%
It was a funny-shaped humanoid
with large jowls, large eyes,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:18.650 align:middle line:10%
and protrusions on the top of
its head in a silvery suit,

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:10%
holding some kind of
device in one hand

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:10%
and a ball in the other hand.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.117 align:middle line:84%
If I was confronted at 45,000
feet with something like that,

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I would
even think or what I would do.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a hard call.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It was a hard call.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But the pilot
decided he was going

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:90%
to take out whatever entity.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:84%
At first they thought
it was a stowaway,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:84%
somebody got aboard our
craft, penetrated security,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and was going to
disrupt our mission.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So what he did was he
pulled out his .38 and shot

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:90%
this thing, twice.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:90%
It fell down in the bomb bay.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Now the bomb bay doors are shot.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
The pilot had immediately
dropped to another altitude,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
fearing that something was
going to happen in the bomb bay.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, that just took that
aircraft out of commission.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They couldn't--
they had to land.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The closest base to land was at
Goose Bay Air Base in Labrador.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So they immediately radioed,
sending flash messages

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:84%
to Goose Bay and to
their base at KI Sawyer.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up
landing at Labrador.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they
landed at Labrador,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Air Force security police
and Canadian security forces

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:90%
arrived.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:84%
They weren't sure exactly
how to get this thing out

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:90%
of the bomb bay.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So they figured they'd just
open the bomb bay doors slowly,

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
which they could
do in the H model.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.125 align:middle line:90%
In the other models, they just--

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Popped open.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.042 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, popped open,
the B, C, and D model.

00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So they opened it, and this
thing falls on the tarmac.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a humanoid of something.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:90%
But it was dead.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:10%
There's no life functions to
it, according to the colonel

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:10%
that was telling us this story.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So medical personnel
came, Canadian Medical,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Canadian Forces base.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Canadian Forces medics came out,
put this thing in a body bag,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and took it in to the
infirmary or some other place.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And now he had to
decide and SAC had

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
to decide, what do
we do from here?

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just killed an
alien on board our aircraft.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And this is the message--

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and he told us verbatim.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the message I sent,
we just killed an alien.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how he got aboard.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:90%
It was an intruder.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:90%
We killed it.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And now what do we do?

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
SAC didn't have
an answer to him.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:90%
He said, maintain crew S there.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, to maintain
crew S on a plane that's

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.083 align:middle line:84%
armed with four
nuclear weapons, they

00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
had to stay in the aircraft,
because they had to guard it.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, they
can't go anywhere.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They can't go anyplace.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:84%
They can't leave the
aircraft, because they're

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:84%
the ones who are
responsible for the aircraft

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and for those four
nuclear weapons that

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:90%
are in the bomb bay door.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So eventually they told them to
take off and fly directly back

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:90%
to KI Sawyer.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
They landed at KI Sawyer
in Northern Michigan.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And they met with
Air Force OSI, who

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:84%
took the whole crew
into a building,

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:84%
questioned them individually,
and said at the end--

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
brought them all together and
said to them, this Air Force

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
OSI agent, he said,
he had a crew cut,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and he's been
around a long time.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:84%
He could just tell on his
voice that this OSI agent's

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:90%
been around a long time.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And the OSI agent
told him, what you

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:84%
think happened over the
Hudson Bay never happened.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
You didn't shoot anybody
aboard that craft.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
extraterrestrial

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:90%
aboard that craft.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:90%
You had oxygen problems.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And you had hydraulic problems.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
landed at Goose Bay.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
had to fly back here.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't know anything
about any aliens.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:90%
We never saw any aliens.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't want you
to go out and repeat that.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Is everyone clear with me?

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel said everybody
said, yes, pretty clear.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
He never spoke about
this to anyone.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But years later, he's at
a retirement convention.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:90%
He sees the flight engineer.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And him and the
flight engineer talk.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
he brings up is,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
remember that incident happened
over at Hudson Bay in '69?

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, this
is like 1990 now.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.583 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't know anything.

00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:01.658 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And he said, no--

00:15:01.658 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:84%
exactly, the flight engineer
said the same thing.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.825 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything, sir.

00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, no, no,
no, no, no, forget

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:90%
about you don't know anything.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:90%
You remember what happened?

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:90%
He said, I remember it.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:90%
But I don't remember anything.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.823 align:middle line:84%
And they walked
away and separated.

00:15:16.823 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That happens a lot.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It happens a lot.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because you don't
know if that person--

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
if you're being tested, even
though it's decades later,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:90%
you're at a convention.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the colonel
figured that the flight

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:90%
engineer thought.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.585 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're the colonel, you
were the aircraft commander,

00:15:33.585 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:90%
you're testing me now.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going to talk.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It's hush-hush now.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And when this story
first came out,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
there were a number of people,
prominent UFO researchers,

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
that immediately
submitted FOIA requests.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force will say,
yes, 60-0058 tail number

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:90%
B-52H was on Chrome Dome.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:90%
It was stationed at KI Sawyer.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It flew missions over
the Arctic Circle.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
There was an incident
on this particular date,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:90%
19th of November 1969.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:90%
It landed.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
further problems,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.747 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:16:15.747 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
That's all the Air
Force will say now.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But we know, the colonel
knows, and all the crew members

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.997 align:middle line:90%
know what really happened.

00:16:21.997 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they ever say
what happened to the ET?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He'd have no idea.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, a lot of
this is still classified.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it went to
Area 51 or to Los Alamos

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.065 align:middle line:84%
or to the Armed Forces Institute
for Pathology for examination.

00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How was the
head of psychiatry

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard University
associated with or involved

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:90%
with US intelligence?

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, Dr. Mack.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, Dr. Mack.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: This is a story that
came out at a UFO convention,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and nobody believed, and
everybody tried to shut it up.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:84%
His friends-- of course,
we know who John Mack was.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:90%
We know he was a doctor.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:90%
He was a psychiatrist.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:10%
He was heavily involved in UFO
investigations and abductions.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And he died of a
mysterious incident.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But what people didn't
know was Dr. Mack

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:84%
was secretly working as a
source for US intelligence.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a little
background on Dr. Mack.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mack was in the
United States Air Force.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:90%
He was a medic in the Air Force.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:90%
He got out of the Air Force.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:84%
He stayed in the
Air Force reserves,

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.370 align:middle line:90%
going to medical school.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So is he associated with
the United States Air Force.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
In the '70s, the Air
Force approached him,

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Air Force OSI
approached him when

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
he was writing books
about abductions

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and analyzing people who
claim to be abducted.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
US intelligence, specifically
US Air Force office

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
of Special Investigations,
Special Projects Branch,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
went to him and pitched
him, said, Dr. Mack,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.540 align:middle line:90%
we'd like you to work for us.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:84%
We'd like you to analyze
military people who

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:90%
claim abductions.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:90%
That was the basic pitch.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And we would like you
to report back to us

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:84%
everything they said, everything
that happened to them,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and whether it was a
legitimate abduction.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want you
to repeat any of this

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:90%
on your civilian practice.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:90%
This has to stay secret.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
This has to stay within
the US intelligence.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that?

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Mack said,
of course I will.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm a loyal American.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I love the Air Force.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
And I'll contribute.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
When we had a case
of an abduction

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
by an Air Force person, an
Air Force male or female,

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
either a dependent or
active duty or reserve

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:84%
or even national guard
person claimed an abduction,

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:84%
we would direct
them to Dr. Mack.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
He would go to Andrews
Air Force Base.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
We would bring him to
Andrews Air Force Base.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And he actually had an office
there at Malcolm Grove Medical

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.785 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:19:15.785 --> 00:19:16.585 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:19:16.585 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: You know that
place well, Emery.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And he would analyze them and
go through the whole routine

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
of analyzing them,
interviewing them, probably

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:90%
mostly in a hypnosis.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
make the determination

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:84%
whether this was a legitimate
abduction or some kind of hoax.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And he would report back
to US intelligence--

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.640 align:middle line:84%
the case officer
would be an OSI agent

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
on special projects-- of the
results of the examination.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
That shocked a lot of people
that he was associated

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:90%
with US intelligence.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people that
figured, when they heard this,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:90%
they figured, you know what?

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:84%
If I was US
intelligence, he would

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
be the one person
I would recruit

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.337 align:middle line:90%
as a source and an asset.

00:20:07.337 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, since this
information came out people,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:84%
immediately start
saying, oh, you

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.465 align:middle line:84%
wanted to feed him
disinformation.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was never
involved with Dr. Mack.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't me.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:90%
It was other agents, OK?

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You were trying to get him to
report back on these civilians.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:84%
No, no, we didn't want to know
anything about the civilians.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Only thing he was doing was
analyzing military people,

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
connections to the
military, whether that

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:84%
was a DOD employee
or an Air Force

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:84%
employee, a dependent
of an Air Force

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
person, an Air Force active
duty person, an Air Force

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
retiree, or a National
Guard or reserve member.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that he
dealt with, not civilian.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want anything
to do with the civilians.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:84%
We didn't ask him
about civilians.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
His civilian practice
and the abductees

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that he was working with,
we didn't want anything

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:90%
to do with that.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We just wanted to know
about these military people

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that we would bring
into his office

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.138 align:middle line:90%
and say, yes and no and yes.

00:21:11.138 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, he was basically
getting intelligence for them

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:90%
about US Air Force members.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the classic, or I
should say extraordinary person

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that he analyzed, was
a full bird colonel,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
meaning he was a full colonel,
a colonel 06, Air Force colonel,

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:90%
who was abducted.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.075 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a complicated story
that would last a long time,

00:21:38.075 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
so I can't go into
great details on it.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But this colonel
was missing time.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:90%
He was at his office.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And he disappeared
from his office.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
His aides, other staff members
around him, knew he was gone.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know where he went.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:90%
His car was still there.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:90%
He never left.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:90%
It was a secured facility.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't go out
through the secured portal.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Where did he go?

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:84%
They searched for hours and
hours and never did find him.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
The next day, they
came to work, and he's

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
lying on the floor in
the back of his office,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:84%
on the floor sleeping
in the uniform

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that he came to work
in the day before.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, immediately his
aides thought he was sick

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
or he collapsed or something
and immediately called

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:90%
medical personnel.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:10%
He was transported
to a hospital.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:10%
And this is around
Washington, DC,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.837 align:middle line:10%
so he was transported to
either Walter Reed or Bethesda.

00:22:32.837 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure where he was.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, he was taken
to a hospital, examined.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:90%
He was confused.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.492 align:middle line:84%
He was dehydrated,
malnutritioned.

00:22:42.492 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:90%
I think those are the things.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And they gave him IVs and
got him back up to par.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And then his aide asked
him, what happened, Colonel?

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:90%
He said, I have no idea.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So they thought something was
funny, so they brought in OSI.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:90%
OSI came in and interviewed him.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they started piecing
things together and looking

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:90%
at the entry and control log.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:84%
The security policemen
never signed him out.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:90%
He came in.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they figured he was
someplace in that building,

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't
figure out where.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Or he was abducted.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And the consensus
was he was abducted.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we transported
him to Dr. Mack.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mack spent several
days with him on and off,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
in fact admitting him
into the hospital.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Did psychological evaluations
on him and did hypnosis.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Hypnosis-- did
that reveal anything?

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Hypnosis
revealed everything.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Dr. Mack told
the OSI agents, he said,

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been around
the world a lot.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I was in the military.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:90%
I spent a little time overseas.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:90%
And I've listened to people.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been in tough
situations before.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But what this colonel
told me, hypnosis,

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.590 align:middle line:84%
scared the living
daylights out of me.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is that?

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.515 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Of course,
the question is, why?

00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:90%
What did he tell you?

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:90%
We want to know.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, I have it
in this document.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:90%
I've recorded everything.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
He said he was taken by
these hostile aliens.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And hostile aliens
threatened Earth,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
said they're going
to attack Earth,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
they're going to destroy
Earth, and showed

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:84%
him pictures of what they
were going to do to Earth,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:84%
meaning destroying it with
these lasers, or beams of light,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.860 align:middle line:90%
I think he said.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were hitting Earth and
causing massive destructions

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and earthquakes and
volcanic activity

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and people flying off the
Earth, all the gravity

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
would be released
from the Earth.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the OSI
agents were saying,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:84%
well, my God, this is what
he said during hypnosis?

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
He says, and I don't think
that he has the ability

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to command or be a colonel
anymore in the United States

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Air Force.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So after the evaluation,
he was retired.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was a colonel.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I think he probably had
enough time to retire.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:90%
He was retired.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But you know what happened,
he couldn't stand it.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And just a short time after he
retired, he committed suicide.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Tragic.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
With the other contactees
that Dr. Mack was looking at,

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:90%
were they in a 3D nature?

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Were they in dreamland?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It was a mixture.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mack explained,
or did reports,

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
did very detailed reports on
every single military person

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
examined that claimed abduction
or some kind of contact.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And they varied.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Some were in a dream-like state.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Some were flesh and
blood in front of them,

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:84%
seeing them in 3D, the
ETs seeing the abductee.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:90%
So it varied.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And another thing we
were interested in

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
was, what position did
these abductees hold?

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Were they pilots, co-pilots?

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Or were they security officers?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Or were they medical
people, pilots?

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:90%
Who were they?

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And they varied.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were pilots.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were ground people.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.780 align:middle line:84%
One was just a
finance specialist,

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.267 align:middle line:84%
a female who worked in a
finance office that paid people.

00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it wasn't
specific at all.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No, it was random.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:90%
And that was his consensus.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They're not out just
picking on the Intelligence

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.820 align:middle line:84%
people or the people that were
working on nuclear weapons.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.385 align:middle line:84%
They're just taking
this person and that--

00:26:55.385 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:90%
who is more vulnerable?

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Now thinking back of what I
know and what other people have

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
known, maybe it had something
to do with their DNA,

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it had something
to do with the fact

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:90%
that maybe they were part ET.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm just guessing on that part.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Was there a larger ratio
in the military population

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:84%
of contactees or the civilian
population of contactees?

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, Dr. Mack
distinguished them a little bit

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
He looked at legitimate--
not everybody

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:84%
that we brought to him and
not everyone he was doing.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to separate
his private practice

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
from what we were paying him to
do and the military practice.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, if he
focused just on the real--

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
what he thought that the
people were being honest about.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, exactly, he was
focusing on the real abducting.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And the ratio between on
the real and the fake,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.370 align:middle line:90%
the real outnumbered the fake.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Although he didn't
go into details

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
about his civilian
practice, he said,

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm busier with the military
than I am with the civilians.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So that basically told us
that there are more legitimate

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
abducting occurring
within military.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just Air Force.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We actually broadened
this to any military,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
including Navy, Army,
and Marine Corps.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But the ratio is vastly
more on the military side

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.293 align:middle line:90%
than on his civilian practice.

00:28:30.293 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There are space
shuttle missions that

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
launch probes into deep space.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Wow, this is a cool one.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
In the 1980s, Discovery
launched a Core--

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:90%
it's called a Core.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
There were Core 1 through 8,
and this was Core 7 satellite

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.510 align:middle line:90%
they launched into space.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It was a classified mission.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It was launched out towards
Jupiter, orbited Jupiter.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was to take
pictures and so forth.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I think a couple of
years into the mission

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:90%
this satellite disappeared.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was it was
flying in its orbit around--

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was either
Jupiter or one of its moons.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And it encountered a UFO.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And the satellite actually
had the capability

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:90%
of taking pictures.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And it took pictures of it.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, what actually
happened next was

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
the UFO captured the satellite
while the cameras were running.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And as the satellite disappeared
and ground-based communication

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.070 align:middle line:84%
systems determine the
satellite disappeared,

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:84%
it was still sending back,
downloading information.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
our ground stations

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.928 align:middle line:84%
picked up all these pictures
of the interior of this UFO.

00:30:01.928 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What did it look like?

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And it was a bright,
very, very, very bright area.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
It had railings as
if it was inside

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:90%
of an industrial complex.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:90%
It didn't show any ETs.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But it showed what an
interior of an ET spacecraft

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:90%
looked like.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:90%
It was an enormous spacecraft.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:90%
It captured a satellite.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, after it got
in, the satellite's cameras

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:90%
shut off.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I think they needed
solar power or something.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, there's
some reason why.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
the person who was
relating this to me.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
There's not a whole lot
to this because it was

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:90%
classified, highly classified.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But NASA we got the
downloads, the pictures.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They immediately turned
them over to the Air Force.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force
looked at this stuff

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and said, my God,
turn it over to NSA.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Wanted to have it analyzed
because the photo interpreters

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.640 align:middle line:84%
are more professional at
NSA than any other agency.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
looking at it saying,

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:84%
this is inside of some
kind of industrial complex.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:90%
They never saw it before.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't identify any
type of structures inside this.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And for the few minutes that
the Core 7 took pictures

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:84%
in the interior, they were
able to redesign it, NASA did.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But the only problem there
is they won't release it now.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.840 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that NASA will say

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
is the Core satellite
missions were a success.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And they won't talk
about anything else.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the mission
engineers for the Core

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:57.200 align:middle line:84%
satellite missions spoke
at a UFO convention,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.780 align:middle line:84%
didn't go into a lot
of details about this,

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:04.150 align:middle line:84%
confirmed that something
happened, and left it at that.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you try to do
a FOIA request on it,

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:84%
are you going to get a
happy-go-lucky Core satellite

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:90%
systems worked?

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.920 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to answer your
questions, because everything

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.900 align:middle line:90%
is still highly classified.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
They can't obviously
release the pictures.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right,
yeah, of course not.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I don't know that many
people saw all the pictures.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But this NASA engineer did see
the pictures, at least some

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:90%
of the pictures.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And he described it.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And the description
was enough for NASA

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:90%
to build a replica of this.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And where is that at?

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.615 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Probably in a hidden
file at NASA right now or NSA.

00:32:51.615 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, is
there something

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that stands out over
the last few years

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.712 align:middle line:90%
that you could share with us?

00:32:58.712 --> 00:33:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, there
was an incident

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that was reported through
some internet traffic

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:90%
that everyone thought was fake.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out that there
was a lot of factual facts made

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that was correct.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And that happened at Minot Air
Force base in North Dakota.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Minot has ICBMs,
and they have B-52s

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that are on ready
alert, not actual alert.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.940 align:middle line:90%
They don't have them anymore.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But the B-52s are out
there on the flight line.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:90%
The crews can be recalled.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
There's no weapons on board the
B-52s, but they can load them.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Air Force, those planes

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.750 align:middle line:90%
can be in the air in two hours.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So an incident
happened where--

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear weapons are stored
in a nuclear weapons storage

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.050 align:middle line:84%
area, but a special one that's
close to the flight line.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And the security police guard
it, security forces, they

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:90%
call them now, guard it.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And in one particular
occasion when

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.909 align:middle line:84%
they were doing a
test, or an alert test,

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.429 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they wanted
to see how fast it

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
would take for the
crew to respond

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.460 align:middle line:90%
and the weapons to be loaded.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Just before this
happened, a sighting of a UFO

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.109 align:middle line:90%
came over the base.

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It came from Canada.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It flew around the
base for a while.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the
wintertime in 2016.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:37.169 align:middle line:84%
And they get a lot of snow
up in northern North Dakota.

00:34:37.169 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, yes.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: So it was melting snow.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It got so low that
it was melting snow

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:84%
around the base, not necessarily
the flight line area,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:84%
but eventually got to the
nuclear weapon storage area

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.909 align:middle line:84%
where they had these
12 nuclear weapons that

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:55.989 align:middle line:90%
were ready to be loaded--

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.281 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Loaded right on, Yeah.

00:34:57.281 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --onto the B-52s
if the alert came up.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And it melted snow all around
this nuclear weapon area.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the flag went up, and
they launched two fighter jets

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.700 align:middle line:84%
from the North Dakota Air
National Guard, F-16s,

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
chased this UFO away.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, they started
investigating this.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:90%
OSI investigated.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:90%
The base investigated it.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they stopped the exercise
that they were going to have,

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:90%
because this was more important.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So the nuclear
technicians went out

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that all the
nuclear weapons were all right.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.010 align:middle line:90%
And there were 12 there.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But they counted them,
and there's one missing.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: What
happened to that one?

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Did the UFO take it?

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:90%
How did they take it?

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.220 align:middle line:90%
They melted all the snow.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Did that have something
to do with it?

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:90%
That's the story.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
An airman, who was not a
security forces member,

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:90%
an airman who was not a--

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm prefacing this-- not a
nuclear weapons technician,

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:18.730 align:middle line:84%
but this airman was
responsible for getting

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:22.277 align:middle line:84%
the crew from their
billets out to the flight

00:36:22.277 --> 00:36:23.110 align:middle line:90%
line in the vehicle.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.220 align:middle line:90%
He was like a driver.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So he was stationed
there, too, and he

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:90%
witnessed all this stuff.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.860 align:middle line:84%
He lived in a small area with
some other air crew members,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:84%
flight line people that would
go out and get the plane ready.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.320 align:middle line:90%
And he lived there with them.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And he posted this story.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, when it was first
posted, nobody believed it.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever-- you know, OK,
you know, who is this guy?

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.690 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really
identify himself.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And then in the chat room, he
tells his story in more details

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:90%
than he posted.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, it got the attention
of Air Force OSI.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, yes.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because the Air Force
OSI knew it really happened.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.680 align:middle line:90%
So they went to this guy.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was still
in the Air Force.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.420 align:middle line:84%
He was still stationed
at Minot Air Force Base.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:84%
They pulled him out, and they
did an investigation on him.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you disclosed
classified information.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.700 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know
what's classified.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling
you what happened.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Show me it's classified.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Show me what I'm
supposed to sign.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, that's good.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I don't know
what's classified.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You guys are saying
it never happened.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.595 align:middle line:90%
It really did happen.

00:37:36.595 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:90%
There was a UFO that flew over.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.390 align:middle line:84%
No, no, it wasn't a
UFO, OSI told him.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, it was a helicopter.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.300 align:middle line:90%
He said, no it wasn't.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.200 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
the nuclear weapon?

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:90%
He started confronting OSI.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.345 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He confronted them.

00:37:48.345 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:90%
I guess it was quite hostile.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:50.750 align:middle line:90%
He ended up in a stockade.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I don't know what
happened to him after that.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:90%
He shut down.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you do a FOIA request
after these seven or eight

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.800 align:middle line:84%
years, the Air Force, all they
claim was an incident happened

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and it remains
under investigation,

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And that, like I said,
happened in 2016.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Anything else,
Rick, that's more current?

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I learned recently
from a very prominent,

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:84%
anonymous source within
the Department of Defense

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that there's a specially trained
United States Marine Corps

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:90%
unit that's stationed at Yuma.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And these Marines are trained
to operate off planet.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's his words to me.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:84%
This is his words,
exact words to me.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
They're trained to
operate off planet.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that brings up
1,000 questions in my mind.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting here
at this restaurant,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:90%
and I know who he is.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.700 align:middle line:84%
He's a very, very prominent
person within the Department

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:90%
of Defense.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how
do you know this?

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.500 align:middle line:90%
He said, I know it.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.970 align:middle line:90%
It's classified.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.300 align:middle line:84%
These guys went through an
enormous amount of training.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're trained
to operate off planet.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Of course, my question
is, where did they go?

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.365 align:middle line:90%
Have they been off planet?

00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:24.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, all I'm going
to tell you is they're

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.820 align:middle line:90%
trained to operate off planet.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, so these
stories that we're

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:84%
hearing about Marines and
the special forces unit

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.650 align:middle line:90%
supposedly--

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a 12th Special
Forces unit out of Fort Bragg.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.760 align:middle line:84%
They're supposedly
trained to fight ETs.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, the Pentagon
have contingency plans

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:90%
for everything imaginable.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
leave it at that.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't go into
any more details.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not going to repeat
it if you tell me something.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, he told me
a few other things

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.890 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not going to repeat.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is that
we have a United States Marine

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Corps unit that's capable
of operating off planet.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Now that to me seems like
they're going into space

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and fighting something
out in space.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Is this Randy Cramer's unit?

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.820 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I even brought up Randy's name.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:90%
He never answered me.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
that is extraordinary,

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have military
units capable of doing

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.020 align:middle line:84%
whatever, fighting ETs
or operating off planet.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What an
extraordinary story.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Rick, I want to thank you
for being on the show.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Thank you,
Emery, for having me.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
