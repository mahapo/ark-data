>>GEORGE NOORY: What could be
more exciting than a mission

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:10%
to outer space?

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And what about exploring
the deepest depths

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:90%
of our own planet, Earth?

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
With us today, of
course, is Emery Smith,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
who was sent on missions
to the Inner Earth.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome to the program.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There has
been so much discussion

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
over the last several years
about the Inner Earth.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:10%
The late Admiral
Richard Byrd flew

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:10%
in through the top of
the planet into an area

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:10%
that he always said was
loaded with incredible things.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Your experience would be what?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Actually, we use
portals to go into these areas.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
There's only very limited
areas that you can actually

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
access these through
the cracks and crevices

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.122 align:middle line:90%
and the caves of planet Earth.

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm trying to get
a picture for this, Emery,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
where you've talked about
portals and crevices.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:84%
To me that sounds like
little slits and openings

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.413 align:middle line:90%
to get down there.

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But isn't there--
and should there

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
be a bigger opening somewhere
where craft like that

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%
could come in?

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there are,
I think, in Antarctica.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
We have seen these on the
maps, these giant holes

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
underneath the ice that are
hundreds and hundreds of yards

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.755 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where they go to,
but they are there for sure.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I know there's more and
more stuff coming out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
every day about
Antarctica and I think

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
it will be exposed
probably this year

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:84%
about the civilization that's
there and also the craft that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:90%
is there.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a very large
craft down there.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of this is going
to happen very, very soon.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
get through these portals,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%
how are you traveling?

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Are you in a craft or what?

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We have special
drones that kind of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
look like giant snakes.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:90%
They're robotic in a way.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And they can run for months and
months and months and months

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
on their own using the
magnetic energy of the Earth.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're coated
in a special plasma.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
send these drones in first

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
because they can go and slither
through these small crevices

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.913 align:middle line:90%
or different types of terrain.

00:02:30.913 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
in this thing?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.983 align:middle line:90%
We're not in these things.

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
These are anywhere from
six to 12 feet long.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:90%
And it brings back information.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
It keeps sending
information back and forth.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to not destroy

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:84%
these pockets in the Earth
that have life in them.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we send these
drones in through the aquifers

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and through the giant
caves and caverns that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:90%
are around the world.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before you
send in a human.

00:03:00.837 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we can't
really send a human.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:90%
You can't crawl there.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It's too far, it's too
long, and the suits

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.645 align:middle line:90%
we have are not that--

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Conducive to that?

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Not really strong
enough to do that yet.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you say these
drones, these snake drones,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:90%
are about six feet long?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They look like snakes.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What they remind me
of is remember a long time ago

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
China came up with those
little plastic snakes

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
you hold by the tail and
they're all segmented?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It has that
type of segmentation.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So it can get into
certain areas.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it
has a special coating

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
of a gel-like hydro
gel plasma over it

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.105 align:middle line:90%
that it keeps making on its own.

00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that allows it
also to leave this residue

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:90%
behind wherever.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's great for in the water.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It can easily swim
through the water.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
It can get into these
really tight crevices.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
It's AI, so it knows
how to maneuver

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
using amazing reversed alien
technology that we've made.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a colonel
who apparently took you

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
into a special
room and showed you

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:90%
a holograph of the Inner Earth.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This room
was a giant table

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and it had an inner
mapping of the Earth.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a GPS for
the inside of the Earth.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a 3D form where
you can move this around

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
with your hands.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:84%
It was all using just
your hands to search

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually
zoom into an area.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was shot in many
different wavelengths.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was in infrared, it was
in color, it was in video,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
it was in many different
types of wavelengths.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And you could pick
if you just want

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
to see the heat signatures
of the creatures down there

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and then zoom in and
see this little mole

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
or this giant
Anaconda-type thing.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So there was so much
life down there.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And these maps
have been used for,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
as far as I know,
over two decades now.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
This system is probably
by now far exceeding

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.943 align:middle line:84%
any type of technology
we can imagine.

00:05:24.943 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
have mapped it,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:84%
people like you who
went down there?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the
mapping had to do

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:84%
with low ground-penetrating
radar, number one.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they use special satellites
that are around the Earth that

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.748 align:middle line:90%
kind of shoot like x-rays and--

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into the planet.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --into the planet
and map this whole thing out.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.818 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, with the map,
what did they do with it?

00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:47.402 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, what
they're looking at

00:05:47.402 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:84%
is they're studying
the biospheres

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:90%
of these giant pockets.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And some are very small,
maybe just the size

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of a football stadium; some
are as large as 100 football

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:90%
stadiums.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And they have their
own energy inside them,

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
geothermal, whether it's

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
bioluminescent to keep
the creatures in there

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:84%
alive, making their
own oxygen. Some

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
of the bubbles of
these spheres that

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
are in the pockets of the Earth
also are dangerous to humans.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't go in there because
it's all methane or carbon

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:90%
dioxide.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As it probably
should be, I guess.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And just like there are certain
creatures in the Marianas

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Trench that can survive
around very hot water

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.255 align:middle line:84%
and these harsh chemicals that
are erupting out of the planet,

00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
life forms there

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't be
able to survive here

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
the Earth, only

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
in these special
containment areas.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This map that they
showed you, how big was it?

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Was it huge, this
holographic map?

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The holographic map, it
starts just like a basketball.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can blow it up
as big as this room.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So the room was about 45
feet in diameter maybe.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
be inside and zoom in

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and you will actually
feel like you're

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
in the actual sphere,
the atmosphere.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a virtual map.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:20.105 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is.

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like a virtual
map so we can actually

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:84%
be walking around inside
the map in this room,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.092 align:middle line:90%
looking at these streams.

00:07:28.092 --> 00:07:29.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
you're really there.

00:07:29.508 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like
you're really there

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and seeing in
different wavelengths.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:90%
You could set the computer--

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
if you want to see
like in that movie,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.050 align:middle line:84%
"Predator," where he had
this thermal vision and you

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:90%
could do things like that.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
You could look in different
types of wavelengths.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can also experience
frequencies from this area

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually
hear the sounds

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that are actually happening
exactly at that point.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you first saw
the map room, when you first

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
saw it and you were made
aware of the Inner Earth, what

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:90%
did you think?

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:90%
Did it trip you out?

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
the biggest surprise

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
was I didn't know that many
hollow points of the Earth.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I was taught there's
a core and magma and this

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and the crust and
all these layers.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's not like that at all.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a honeycomb.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
There's all these areas,
all these aquifers.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these
huge pockets of life

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
that are flourishing down there.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:84%
For me, I felt like,
wow, these are--

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
it's like another planet
within a planet, to be honest.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.749 align:middle line:84%
>>>>NOORY: Did they take you
down there into the Inner

00:08:42.749 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.826 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've been there
through portals, yes.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:90%
What's down there?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, mostly
just collecting specimens,

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:84%
kind of like what we were
doing a while ago with going

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:90%
to different planets.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that for a fact.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.008 align:middle line:84%
I can just tell you maybe
it was just Inner Earth.

00:09:03.008 --> 00:09:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
weren't really part

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
of the group that
spent time down there

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and lived down there.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Why did they want
you down there?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Really,
they're monitoring this

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to preserve it.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
There's so many Amazonian
tribes and other tribes

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
from around the world that
we don't want to infect them.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And it could really
possibly happen

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that if instead of sending
a drone, that we send

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
a person into an
area, we could kill

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
the whole civilization of
whatever-- of animals and flora

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:90%
and fauna and things like that.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're being very
careful, very delicate.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
There's parts, though, however,
that people have already

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
journeyed to the center
of the Earth, I'll say,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and they know it's
safe to go there

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and that the bacteria
and viruses are not

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:90%
going to kill either person.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have to wear
a special suit or anything

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.492 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We always
wear special suits

00:09:59.492 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
that enclose the entire body.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were down there,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.397 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be pitch
black, or is it lighted?

00:10:08.397 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's a good question.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
is very, very dark.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we use special
lighting, night vision things

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and lots of lighting
and things like this.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have drones
and robotic devices

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that come with us that assist
us with this type of thing.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, it
creates its own lit atmosphere

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
with a type of bioluminescence,
a type of chemical,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:90%
but in more depth.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Think of when the fog rolls in
San Francisco, that fog that

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.830 align:middle line:84%
comes in, and imagine all
those moisture particles

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.295 align:middle line:84%
and pollution particles
actually glowing.

00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So everything is lit.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything's
illuminated.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's all
illuminated from a cloud.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know the exact
science behind that,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
but this is what
I have witnessed.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
were you down there?

00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The longest I've
ever been there is a day.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One full day?

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
sleep down there?

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:90%
You're pretty busy.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
You have a list of things that
you're doing as a technician.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's many of
us that are there

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.757 align:middle line:90%
doing different types of jobs.

00:11:12.757 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you went
into the Inner Earth,

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
did you go in through the
South Pole or the North Pole?

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.255 align:middle line:84%
We go through a base,
through our portal systems.

00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I
mean, where is it?

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The one I went through?

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Geographically where?

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It was in New Mexico.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's in New Mexico?

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The portal that
I'm talking about

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
is a natural portal where
you walk right through a veil

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:90%
and you're already there.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many portals
are there on the planet?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, my goodness.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.758 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell you.

00:11:38.758 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
all over the place?

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Probably over
180 that I'm aware of.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could somebody walk
into it accidentally and end up

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
being in the center
of the planet?

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
There have been incidences
where most of these things

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:90%
now are under strict control.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They're under huge
security even if they're

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle
of nowhere where

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:90%
no one would actually even go.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They have special satellites
that monitor these areas.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And there have been things
like animals and people gone

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:84%
missing out of
nowhere in the past,

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't happen
as often anymore.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I was watching you
and you walked into a portal,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:90%
would you like just disappear?

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.677 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
what I would see?

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You would just
see me bleed into nothing.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So you'd just see me kind of
digitize into nothingness.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you walk back I

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
would just see you appear
and all of a sudden.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
No, it wouldn't be like
appearing out of nowhere.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.053 align:middle line:84%
You would see a bleeding of
my atomic structure being re--

00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would know
something was happening.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:90%
You could see it.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Many people have witnessed
craft flying into mountains

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%
and disappearing--

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.372 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aircraft
and other things.

00:12:56.372 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Bermuda
Triangle could be an area.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There is a lot of
excellent footage online

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that shows motorcycles
just going down

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
the street and all of a
sudden, they're not there

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:90%
and people as well.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And these are sometimes
shifts in the portals

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.762 align:middle line:84%
because a portal can
actually move itself.

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
doesn't necessarily

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.768 align:middle line:90%
have to be attached to ground.

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It could be up in the
sky somewhere, right?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Like the Bermuda Triangle.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.418 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So a plane
could fly through it.

00:13:26.418 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: A plane can fly
in, be gone for a year,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:90%
and fly right back.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To come back,
do you have to come back

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
through that same portal
or is there another area

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:90%
you could pop up in?

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The portals are set
up on the axis of the Earth.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with also the
solar system and how everything

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:90%
is aligned, especially the sun.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it uses the energy
of all the planets, the sun,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth for it
to kind of dial in

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:84%
on these Inner Earth portals,
not the universal portals.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.503 align:middle line:90%
By the way, those are different.

00:14:04.503 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
asked to go down

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:90%
there to do some special task?

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to go down
there and collect specimens

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and to also record beings
and kind of covertly

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:90%
do it without them knowing.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And we had special suits that
make you basically completely

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.750 align:middle line:84%
cloaked and invisible
that we would wear,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a photographer
for National Geographic

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
would do in the Serengeti and
visualize and watch and record

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
with many different types
of amazing equipment.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And the atmospheres also down
there were so interesting.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.150 align:middle line:84%
They were iridescent,
sometimes rainbow-colored.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we had to use
special goggles and special--

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
our helmets are able to
actually change the tint

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
because there's some
light that would actually

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:90%
be dangerous for us.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we lose any
men or women down there?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Many people have
passed on these missions, yes.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you ever in a
position where you thought

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:90%
you might not make it back?

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We couldn't get to
the portal to activate back.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To come back?

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's got to be scary.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It was very frightening.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You almost
couldn't come back through.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they finally open it

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:90%
or how did you finally find it?

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, like I said,
the portals can actually move

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and we special
magnetometer-type things that

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.660 align:middle line:84%
let us know where it is and
how long it can stay open.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you only have a
certain amount of time

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that you can use it
to get to this place.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could close up?

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So like when we do with
space, we might only

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:90%
have a 15, 30-minute timeframe.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But with Inner Earth,
it's way different

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and Earth's completely
moving all the time.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
The Inner Earth
core, people always

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:84%
think that the core is like
a bowling ball; it's not.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like more of a blob.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
It actually can
move, it's fluid.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And this sets off different
magnetic anomalies.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So we use mostly portals that
have been used for thousands

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:84%
of years that we've learned
through ancient texts

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
that we know are safe.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes we have accidents.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're going
through a portal, Emery,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and somehow it starts closing
up on you and half of you

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
is through and the other
half hasn't made it yet,

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
let's just say it's got you
through your torso, what

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.698 align:middle line:84%
happens to the
other half of you?

00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've never
seen that happen.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.907 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, that reminds me
of the Philadelphia Experiment,

00:16:59.907 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:84%
where some guys were
stuck in the ship halfway.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
That was an experiment
gone horrifically wrong.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is time
real down there?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you go in at
noon and spend an hour,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:84%
it's one o'clock
when you come out?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is still rotating,
you're still in the Earth,

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're still in this solar
system going around the sun

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.263 align:middle line:84%
so everything is still
on the same time.

00:17:27.263 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were down there,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
you've made reference
to a craft of some type.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.688 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there
was a craft that

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:84%
was very deep within
the Earth that we

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:90%
had another craft similar.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And we were trying to compare
it, trying to compare and see

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
if it was the same civilization
and why it was there.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
with this map, you

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
can still zoom into the
craft so you can actually

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:90%
see this craft.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:90%
There are many craft down there.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
One was triangular
with a round top on it.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they big?

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, enormous.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, enormous craft,
larger than a football

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%
field sometimes.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And some
are very small,

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.317 align:middle line:90%
as big as a Volkswagen Beetle.

00:18:13.317 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like one could be the
mother ship and the other could

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:90%
be a little--

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of these--

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that's an excellent point,
which I never talk about.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Many of these larger
craft under the earth

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
actually have hundreds of
little crafts attached to them.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is why a lot of
people see in the sky,

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, a bright light and
then all these little lights

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:90%
started shooting out everywhere.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And these are these craft.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:90%
They're all made of light.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
the craft come from?

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did the Inner
Earth beings create it,

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%
or was it brought there?

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Most of these craft
were actually teletransported

00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and kind of got stuck there
from another dimension.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they went through
a portal and ended up

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a giant
piece of iron in the Earth.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's my own opinion.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they still there?

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the craft
are still there.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:90%
But no beings are living.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they're not flying?

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Definitely not flying.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
They've been there
for quite some time.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if there
are some people who

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:90%
are still operating them?

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
ones operating

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:84%
constantly in our atmosphere
all the time, cloaked.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.030 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes during lightning
storms, you'll get to see it

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or in different fluctuations of
different parts of the Earth.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You usually see these
things around volcanoes

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and major earthquakes
and things like that.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they do become
back into our frequency

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
so you can see them
for just a little bit.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:90%
So they do still exist.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But the one I am
referring to underground

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
is not operational and does
not house any life forms.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why haven't
we tried to extract it?

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, it's too deep.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It's too deep in the Earth.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:84%
If anything, they'll
probably use the maps

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and send drones
down at some point

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking many,
many, many, many miles.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it kept
a secret from us, Emery?

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
what they want to do

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is preserve it, number one,
and they don't want the United

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Nations wanting
to say, well, no,

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
we claim this because this
is 30 miles below our country

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:90%
or this is here, this is there.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:90%
It might probably start a war.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Because people are going to--

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
they're already selling
plots on the moon

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:90%
and on Mars on certain websites.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very funny that
you know here we are on Earth.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Are we selling parts
of the ocean now?

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.725 align:middle line:84%
If it were to get
out, I do believe

00:20:50.725 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
that would happen

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is we would infiltrate it
and basically destroy it,

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
as we are doing to
planet Earth right now.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So at least they're
doing the right thing

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and just monitoring it and
using special equipment instead

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
to get samples
without always having

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:84%
to go there in your
physical 3D to grab things.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
question yourself,

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
why have they picked
me to do this?

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Why am I down here?

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well there's
many qualified

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
people like myself
in the military

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and out of the
military that have

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
been traveling all
over the universe

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and doing things like
what I was doing,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle line:84%
which I was just
harvesting specimens.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they first showed
you this holographic map,

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:90%
were you in awe with this?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was it like, oh my
god, this is down there?

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, no.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I kind of
was already debriefed

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.643 align:middle line:84%
on it like a year before and we
had already obtained samples--

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you knew there
was something down there?

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --that there
was some Inner Earth

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
thing going on and
tunneling systems and cave

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
systems and underwater
aquifers that you

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
could use for travel to one
part of the planet to the next.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
living areas in the Earth

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:90%
are surrounded by water.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you would
think there is a lot of water

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.402 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:20.402 --> 00:22:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the big picture is, Emery,

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:90%
with this Inner Earth?

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.533 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, who's they?

00:22:28.533 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, I don't know.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.145 align:middle line:90%
You can tell me who they is.

00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, like I said,
this is an observation.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And they now, with
this technology,

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
know where all the hidden
crafts are underground.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
They know where all
the different cities

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:90%
and ancient cities are located.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're trying
to figure out a story

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
plan to probably
disinform us, if anything,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
for the first maybe
next 100 years.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what it really

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
has to deal with because
it changes history,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:90%
it changes modern day religion.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would
change everything

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to know that there is something
else going on in the planet.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And always
has been, right?

00:23:15.848 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: A lot of
things would happen

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and there would probably
be wars over this of trying

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:21.975 align:middle line:90%
to gain control over it.

00:23:21.975 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, are their advanced
civilizations down there?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know of any.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
extraterrestrials

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that have their own
facilities at different parts

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.955 align:middle line:90%
of the planet that we spoke--

00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Extraterrestrials?

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Extraterrestrials
that have been here

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's been civilizations
here for millenniums.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think these are leftover
remnants of these other beings

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:90%
that used to be there.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand
the extraterrestrials that

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
do live down there
can come and go

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
as they please using their
own special technology, which

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
is not a jumbo jetliner or
some sort of tunneling machine.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But are they all
extraterrestrial or are

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.100 align:middle line:90%
some of them from this planet?

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I believe
that some of these beings

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
have evolved from the planet,
even the Atacama being.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the Inner Earth.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: From the
Inner Earth, correct.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
There's many sightings around
the planet of these shorter

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
beings running around, 24
inches tall, near caves

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
at night and things like
this, which I think actually

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
originated here from the
Earth somehow over hundreds

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of years.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have a gap, you see.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
We can't explain how we got
from Cro-Magnon to here.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:90%
There's a big, big issue there.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe these beings
are the beings that people

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:84%
speak of fairies and gnomes
and trolls and leprechauns.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think they actually
are part of the Earth,

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:90%
that they somehow formed here.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, as we did.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:84%
They just happened
to be down there.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe
we're more hybrids.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.015 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do believe we had
a lot of genetic engineering,

00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:84%
a lot of help to get
to where we're at.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we've
just blossomed out

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
of a flower or a
mushroom in the Amazon.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I think there is definitely--
because of the gap where

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:30.470 align:middle line:84%
we can't explain how did we
get from primate to here,

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:90%
I think for them it's opposite.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
They did spawn somehow
from the Earth.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
things going on down there

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really
understand, yet

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to preserve
it at the same time.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's clear that
these beings have been around

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
for a long time and
people are still

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:84%
seeing them in certain
regions of the planet.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:90%
So what did they do?

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Do they sneak out of
crevices and portals

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and come up on the
surface and then go

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:90%
rushing back down again?

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I think some of them
are being pushed out

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
of their area due
to certain things

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we're doing
that are hurting the Earth.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So they're moving
more to the surface.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To survive?

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: To survive and getting
out of hot spots and different

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.380 align:middle line:90%
types of--

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.330 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of
earthquakes and volcanoes

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and things that are
happening through scalar

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and phototometry that's our
fault. We made these devices

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's ruining the
Inner Earth, as well.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's damaging these
natives or whatever

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
you want to call these
Inner Earth beings.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So they're moving around
and people are starting

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:90%
to see them now and then.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're like
putting water in an ant hole

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and the ants come flying out.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Excellent.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.507 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:59.507 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you said
they're about two feet tall?

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.423 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
many different sizes.

00:27:03.423 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But the ones are being reported
all around South America

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and Africa and Europe and China
seem to all be under 48 inches.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
must be just fleeing

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:90%
to get out of the Inner Earth.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's
something going on,

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.595 align:middle line:84%
obviously, that's destroying
their habitat that's

00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:90%
underneath the Earth.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.612 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What to do their
ancient cities look like?

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's very
primitive, number one.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It looks something like
an old Roman-type--

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
it's all a stone but more
natural granite-type of

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:45.620 align:middle line:84%
hollowed out into the cave
walls and inside there's

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:90%
no home structures.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no condominiums
or anything like that.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
They don't have--

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
have high technologies.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:53.058 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They don't
have high technology,

00:27:53.058 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:84%
but they have a
special technology.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:59.120 align:middle line:84%
They know levitation, they
know how to move a giant rock,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
they know how to produce
water, they know how

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:90%
to make elements to survive.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And also, they can
control their temperature.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
them to be benevolent?

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well-intentioned?

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The flora and fauna are more
dangerous than anything,

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:90%
which we'll get into later.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And the creatures that
live down there, too, that

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
are kind of like if you're
going to be in the Serengeti

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:84%
there and hang out with
some lions, you might get

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:90%
chomped on.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes when
we see things, Emery,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that we can only imagine,
it gets to be emotional.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It's so dramatic.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Did that happen to you?

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Many times, especially finding
carcasses of things that I

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
didn't understand what they were
and feeling there emotional--

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
there was emotional attachments
to certain beings that were

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:90%
down there that were--

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.022 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.022 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:90%
you knew they were conscious.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.923 align:middle line:84%
You knew the animal
was conscious

00:29:07.923 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:90%
when it looked at you.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You knew the being saw you but
didn't even care about you,

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:90%
just kept going.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fact that you
go public about this now,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
are there groups or agencies
that are really like ticked off

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:90%
at you for saying these things?

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Not about Inner Earth.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't want me
talking about, of course,

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
the holograms, the radars,
the satellites, and the stuff

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that we have because no
one's going to believe what

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying right now anyway.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:84%
They know there's going to be a
very small amount of the public

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.670 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
believe that there's

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:90%
fairies living under the Earth.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't say
nobody's going to believe you.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I think you've got
quite a following

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.712 align:middle line:84%
and people probably
will believe you.

00:29:46.712 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They get upset when
I talk about the technology.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
They get upset when I teach the
world how we actually did it,

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:84%
how time travel is possible,
how portal technology is real,

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:90%
how all this stuff.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming out slowly.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Someone's listening,
which is good,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and which helps
give me credibility.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
would you say might

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
be the most important
knowledge we've gotten

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:90%
knowing about the Inner Earth?

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think the
most important thing

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have learned
from Inner Earth

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:90%
is preservation, number one.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And why can't we bring
that preservation up here

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the Earth
and start utilizing it

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:90%
in a professional way?

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Utilizing the
technologies, of course,

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that are down there
that are all natural

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.990 align:middle line:84%
with different elements
and minerals and things

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
like that that can help also
cure a lot of the problems

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
we have here on
top of the Earth.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't
we doing this?

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, it's suppressed.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Everything is always suppressed
by major corporations

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and different
political governments

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:84%
within governments
that people don't even

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
know about these
governments that

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:84%
are very gifted with
technologies and things

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.777 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you go again?

00:31:03.777 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you have it.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Another great experience
from Emery Smith.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."
