>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO, ET,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:10%
related intelligence.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Today we're discussing
a secret operation

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to explore the far
side of the moon.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.955 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.195 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is
Operation Sapphire Selene?

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Operation Sapphire
Selene was a classified

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.875 align:middle line:84%
operation that started
back in the 60s.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:48.675 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK.

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The military
thought that it

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
would be advantageous to them
to put a base on the moon

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:90%
to fight any future wars.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
initial operation was.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
In the early 70s we found a
craft that had crashed or landed

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
in the desert of
west of Las Vegas.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So we captured that craft,
took it to our advanced,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
back in those days, it
was advanced research

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and development center,
which was at Groom Lake.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And we tried to figure out
exactly how that craft worked

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and whether we
could either reverse

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
engineer it or train pilots,
military pilots to fly it.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the technology of
this particular craft,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:90%
which they called--

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
they codenamed Polyzena, and was
that it was just too complicated

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:90%
to reverse engineer.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Our technology hadn't
advanced enough--

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --in the
mid 70s to do that.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And right around
this time frame,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
we acquired another spacecraft
that had actually we found--

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
we didn't find, but
another friendly country

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:90%
found in the Middle East.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
We're going to say Saudi Arabia.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And we went and picked that
thing up and brought it back.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
And now that was called Remus.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:84%
They named them, I think, after
mythology, Greek mythology.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
objective of that?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The objective
was to reverse

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
engineer these crafts
or train military pilots

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to operate these crafts,
to fly to the moon.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
At the time, in the 70s, we
didn't have anything other than

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
the Apollo Program that could
launch a spacecraft from

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:90%
the Earth and land on the moon.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But an extraterrestrial
craft we knew

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
could do this in, number
one, in a faster time

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
period or a quicker time
period, and probably

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
be more maneuverable in the
environment of the moon rather

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:90%
than the Apollo spacecraft.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
As we knew, the
Apollo spacecraft

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
was launched by a rocket, took
three days to get to the moon,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:84%
had to orbit the moon
and land, and then

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
take off in a
conventional manner.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Whereby if we utilize an
extraterrestrial craft

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that we recovered and
reverse engineered

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
or train our pilots
to operate them,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%
it would be more functional.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
The Polyzena craft was
entirely different technology

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:90%
than the Remus craft.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.615 align:middle line:10%
So that meant it came from
two different extraterrestrial

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:21.415 align:middle line:10%
civilizations.

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:22.215 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:24.932 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: So what we had to do
was train pilots to fly them.

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Whose craft was
it in the first place?

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: At the time, we didn't
know what alien craft it was.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
extraterrestrials

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
in the craft when they
found it, but we had

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:90%
top scientists working on this.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Two, we couldn't
reverse engineer

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:84%
because our technology
had advanced enough,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
but we were able to train some
pilots to actually operate

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:90%
these two crafts.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And once
they did finally

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
train the pilots to operate
it, what did they do next?

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, it took a
long time, number one,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.538 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
technology inside the craft.

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:58.705 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's a long time?

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I think several years.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They worked on trying
to understand the flying

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms of the craft, the
propulsion system of the craft.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So they had to experiment,
and they did it

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:84%
over and over and
over again, trying

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
to put their hands in one
place, and then their foot

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:90%
in another place.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
And they did this for a long
period of time, monotonous

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle line:84%
as one of the pilots
told me, very monotonous

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't understand
anything about this craft.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, we were
able to actually lift

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:90%
this craft off the ground.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was the
easy part of it.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
The hard part was flying it, and
that took another long period

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of time to be able to not
only lift it off the ground

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:90%
and fly it, but maneuver it.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But over a period of
time, we figured it out.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And we trained several United
States Air Force pilots

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:84%
in the operation of
the Polyzena First.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Once these pilots were trained.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
In the operation
of Polyzena craft,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.647 align:middle line:84%
they transported to melanocyte,
which was west of Groom Laken.

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was form of-- it
was like a launch pad.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I guess the easiest
way to explain it.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to launch
it into Earth's orbit.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They were able to take it
off the ground into the air.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But maneuvering it was
the hard part of it.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But they did this over and
over again, repetition.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And finally they
were able to orbit

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:90%
the craft around the Earth.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was it hand controlled?

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, you kept saying, they
had to place hands, or was

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%
it mind controlled?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Or what could you
tell us about that?

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There were no knobs,
buttons or switches inside.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:84%
All they had was on a
panel, hand imprints

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.128 align:middle line:84%
where the extraterrestrials
would put their hands in.

00:05:48.128 --> 00:05:49.045 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Five fingers?

00:05:49.045 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, unfortunately,
there were only four fingers.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what they had to
overcome because we have five,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:90%
we have a thumb digit.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have a thumb digit.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Whatever extraterrestrial
race this was.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that was the
same between the Polyzena

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
craft and the Remus craft was
a hand print control system.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.198 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So they both had this?

00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They both had it.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, they were
able to figure it out.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure exactly
how because there's

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stuff involved in
the operation of these crafts

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.900 align:middle line:90%
are probably still classified.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But they were able
to fly these crafts,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
they were able to lift the
Polyzena off the ground

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
into orbit, circle
the Earth once

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and bring it back to
the same location.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:84%
They realized that what they
were doing, what this craft was

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:90%
doing, had a memory of its own.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:90%
If they were to--

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to take off, they put it in the
right direction, it flew itself.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:90%
They realized this.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
thinking, let's talk

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
about thinking of something
and seeing this craft does it.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, we have probably
different thought patterns

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
than the extraterrestrials
that owned this craft,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.427 align:middle line:84%
but they studied this over
and over and over, repetition.

00:07:11.427 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
that if they started

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
thinking about something,
this craft would do it.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's when they
realized this craft had

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:90%
a mind of its own.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the technicians,
not the pilots,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
but one of the technicians
that assisted on this told me,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
he said, this was a
dream, the Polyzena craft

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
was a dream to fly
because you just

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
had to think with your
hands inside of it.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, they managed to figure
out how to block the thumb,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:90%
because we have a thumb.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But they figured
it out in some manner.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Remus craft was
a little bit different,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
although it had the
same handprints.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.840 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't think
something because if they

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
kept trying to do that,
and it wouldn't work.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But they found these
containers under the floor,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
the command floor of the
craft, these round balls.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know how
they moved those balls.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
They knew they
could move, but they

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do it from the
station, the command station.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So they figured it
had to be somebody

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
else at another location
to move these balls.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't really
know what these balls were.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They were round
spheres and they were

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
about the size of a beach ball,
something similar to that.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
They were silver in shape, but
they had these sockets inside

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And the sockets would spin
when the craft was moving.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole
sphere would move.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So then they again,
repetition, repetition.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they figured out
there were foot pedals

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials would
put their feet into and move

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and then control the craft
almost like a yoke and rudder

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:90%
on a regular aircraft.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so now
they figured out

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:90%
how to maneuver these things.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were done by these
balls that were under the floor.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So the Remus craft was the
hardest to get off the ground,

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:84%
but they eventually were able
to get it off and fly it.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But they only flew it
around the test area.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:84%
They didn't try to take it up in
orbit, because there were little

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the
interior of the craft

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:84%
or the interior atmosphere
because they knew

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:84%
that if they took it off the
ground and the atmosphere

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
inside the cockpit, so
to speak, wasn't right,

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:90%
they'd kill the pilots.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
How do you control
the inner atmosphere?

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that took them the longest
to find out on the Remus.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the Polyzena
craft, when it took off,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
it automatically created a
positive atmosphere environment,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:84%
a positive pressure environment
inside the control area.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So the pilots didn't
have to wear helmets,

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have to--
they automatically

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:90%
were able to breathe.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
It almost created an
atmosphere for them.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:90%
And they circled the Earth.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.955 align:middle line:84%
Coming back, flight surgeons
examined the pilots.

00:10:15.955 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
There weren't anything
wrong with them.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Checked their lung
functions and things

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they were
all right and flying there.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:84%
What the rationale behind
it is that this craft was

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
a living organism and
adjusted to whoever was in it.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way the
scientists kind of figured it

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:84%
There's one still alive, the Los
Alamos scientist, 90 years old.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
He said anybody could
have got into that cockpit

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
would have adjusted

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
for that particular
creature or person, human

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Polyzena craft, which
was a little bit different,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
they found some containers in
the side of the aircraft that

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.693 align:middle line:90%
contained something.

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.068 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
know what it was.

00:11:01.068 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were afraid
to try to open it up

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:84%
because it appeared to
be some sort of a fluid.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they figured
if they opened this

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
up and leaked the fluid,
then they'd have a problem.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But there were long tubes
with the fluid in it.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, well,
maybe that's where

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
would live or stay

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
or hibernate or something like
that during long space missions.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:84%
They realized that when there
were two pilots in the command

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:84%
seats and they put their hands
in the indentations, these vats

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:84%
with fluid in it, the fluid
start would start moving,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:90%
like boiling it.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And then there
were these small vents,

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
they didn't realize at
first, but these small vents

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:90%
would spray out something.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what was
dangerous, they thought,

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to the pilots because the pilots
didn't have any helmets on,

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
so they thought this stuff
might be hazardous to them.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a form of
something that came out

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that filled the cockpit
with a pressure of something

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:90%
that we never--

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
ever understood,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
allowing these pilots to
stay in a positive pressure

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:84%
environment or a
gravity, with gravity,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
we call it-- they call
it positive pressure.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.107 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: When I ask them exactly
what they're talking about,

00:12:24.107 --> 00:12:25.065 align:middle line:90%
they're saying gravity.

00:12:25.065 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It seems
like it creates

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.395 align:middle line:84%
its own atmosphere and its
own gravitational field.

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exactly, and that's
exactly what happened.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.595 align:middle line:84%
And they figured that
out with the Remus.

00:12:32.595 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how did
the decision to go

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.525 align:middle line:84%
to the far side of the moon come
about with this new technology?

00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, their mission in
the first place was to set up

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:90%
bases on a dark side--

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
dark side of the moon,
because we could hide

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and we could hide a force,
we could hide construction

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
on the far side of the moon,
because at that time period,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
nobody else, no other
country on Earth

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:90%
visited that side of the moon.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So we figured-- the military
or the Department of Defense

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
figured that was the best
place to hide a force.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And with these crafts,
that could fly us there,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have to worry about
any other type of Earth crafts

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
not making it to the
far side of the moon.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's the mission and
that's what they wanted to do.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what kind of
special forces were involved,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.815 align:middle line:84%
and what type of training
did they have to undergo?

00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the
Department of Defense

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
selected a unique
group of personnel

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
that had to be a certain type of
physical, structured, physical

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:84%
fitness, a certain
height and weight.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And they selected these out
of the special forces units,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
mostly at that time, the Army
Special Forces or the Army

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Rangers.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I believe all but a select
few Air Force personnel

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:90%
were selected.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force personnel
had to be technicians

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
that were capable of repairing
things, monitoring the craft.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
They were being trained on
the Polyzena and the Remus.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So those would-- those type of
people would go plus pilots.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.477 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't just
take two pilots.

00:14:14.477 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:84%
What happened if something
happened to those two pilots?

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure--

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So they had to
train a number of pilots.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And in another
problem they had was,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
how, do you put a special
forces unit inside these crafts?

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Where do they sit?

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:90%
How do they transport them?

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And they figured this all out
because once they did tests

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:84%
at Nevada test site,
where they would launch

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:84%
the crafts with these
soldiers inside,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
they realized that the
pressure and the gravity

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:90%
was the same as Earth.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have to worry
about them flying up in the air

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:84%
or being in a negative
pressure environment.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
They were already in a
positive pressure environment.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
They tried to put
seats inside of them,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:84%
but the seats, they didn't have
any way of attaching the seats.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But then what
they decided on doing

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:84%
was putting poles, so they would
push the pole like a pressure

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:84%
pole to the top and
the bottom of the craft

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:90%
and put the seat in that.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And they did that.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And each craft could
hold 30 soldiers.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so they were
able to train these.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.640 align:middle line:84%
They flew them over and over
and over again, in repetition.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were trained in
a special type of combat.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the moon only
have a sixth of the gravity--

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Gravity.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So the normal weapon,
a gun, a handgun and M16 rifle

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't work on the moon.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.666 align:middle line:84%
So they had to make
different types--

00:15:42.666 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:84%
create different types
of weapon systems.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:90%
And one was a laser weapon.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Another one was a pressure
weapon, a pressure gun.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So they developed these
things, and then they

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
had to train the soldiers
with these things.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And another thing before
the mission could start,

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:84%
we had a place, at least two
satellites in the moon's orbit,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to assist
in mapping and communications

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and other things with
these two crafts.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Another problem we
had with the crafts

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:84%
was installing our
communications device

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:90%
in the craft.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because how are we
going to communicate with Earth,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:90%
because we couldn't--

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we could figure
out their communications device.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But smart people,
I don't know who,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
but smart people figured
out how to put an antenna

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and put our own type
of communications

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:90%
device inside the craft.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there
any significant events

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.675 align:middle line:84%
on their journey to the moon,
and when did they take happen?

00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: President Reagan
had to give the approval,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and he did that
in April of 1981.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:90%
He said he was briefed on it.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:90%
He said, go for it.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Do they have any test runs?

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, they
figured they wanted

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to run a test to make sure this
thing got to the moon all right

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And so they did.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:84%
The Polyzena took a test
run, was launched out

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of a special launch area out
of Melon and Nevada test range.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And it went to the moon,
circle the moon once,

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and then came back.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And that whole mission
only took them eight hours.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
So they realized, after
they did that test,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:90%
that they could do it.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And the pilots who had over 100
hours in this craft by that time

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
were very confident
that they could fly it.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
They knew enough about
the operation of it.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, the one thing
that they haven't figured out

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:90%
yet was the propulsion system.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But they knew that
certain controls operated

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:90%
that propulsion system.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have any operating
nuts and bolts, so to speak,

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.295 align:middle line:84%
but it was able
to fly this craft.

00:17:53.295 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So even if
they thought faster,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
like, I want to go there
faster, it just had one speed,

00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
you're telling me.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Once they got into
them-- and this is Polyzena,

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
they could think
how to navigate.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Once they thought
about the moon, then

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:90%
this thing flew to the moon.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.545 align:middle line:84%
And the propulsion system got
them there in eight hours.

00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, you got
to figure out--

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.315 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's fast.

00:18:17.315 --> 00:18:18.115 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:10%
If you figure out the distance,
220,000 miles from Earth

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.805 align:middle line:10%
to the moon and how fast
if it took eight hours--

00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:10%
simple math can explain how fast
they had to go to get there.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the pilots
figured later--

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, talked about later
was there was something else

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
involved in this.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't necessarily
a propulsion system.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Something was happening in
front of the spacecraft.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It was like you were
looking at a hot desert

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
floor in the middle
of the Mojave Desert.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.995 align:middle line:84%
There were waves, heat
waves you would see.

00:18:56.995 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the
occupants could see out

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:90%
of this craft, obviously.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They had a portal
from they could see out,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
but everything was distorted
when that craft started going.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So they figured there
was something else that

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:84%
was causing them to go that
fast or to move into space.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Once it left the Earth's
orbit, now it's in space.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they figured it out.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Remus is something
different, though.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Remus is entirely
different technology.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
When they got into Earth's
orbit and started taking off

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:84%
towards the moon, everything
became distorted to the point

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:90%
it was blacked out.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't see, so they
couldn't really navigate.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
How can you navigate
when you can't

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
see what's in front of you?

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like flying with
visual flight rules rather

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:90%
than instruments.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But it seemed to
know where it was going.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The two pilots who had hours
and hours of flight time

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:84%
with the Remus, they
said it just seemed

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:90%
to know where it was going.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It took a little longer to get
to the moon on a test flight,

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:90%
but they got there and got back.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So now we're set for a
real mission to the moon.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, you mentioned
this craft can hold 30 soldiers.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So give us an idea, how
large was this craft?

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And if they did go to the
dark side of the moon,

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
where do they go,
all the soldiers?

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.572 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK.

00:20:30.572 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
The Polyzena was about
the size of a 737,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
although round in shape, it
was 27 from top to bottom.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.365 align:middle line:84%
It was made of a structured
material on the outside.

00:20:45.365 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Metallic or?

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Metallic.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:84%
They found later a lot
of other different things

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:90%
about the craft.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
The Remus was a little
bit smaller than that,

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
but it still was
a saucer shaped.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things the Remus had
that the Polyzena didn't have it

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:84%
was about 20 feet
from top to bottom.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
It was about the same
diameter, a little bit

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:90%
shorter, a little bit smaller.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But it'd have-- had a bar in
the middle, a round bar that

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.590 align:middle line:84%
moved around when the
craft was in operation,

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Polyzena didn't
have one of those things.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So they think that was an
equilibrium type of thing

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:90%
that kept the craft from--

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that was what we thought,
our scientists thought.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So these things were able to
accommodate the 30 soldiers,

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking 30
each 31, 30 other plus

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:90%
supplies that they took along.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.477 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because they weren't
going to be there three days.

00:21:46.477 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the problem.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what's on
the dark side of the moon,

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
except, remember, we
launched satellites earlier.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And the satellites
were taking pictures.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.110 align:middle line:84%
These two satellites mapped
the dark side of the moon

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and sent those pictures
back and gave them

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
to the crew that was going to be
on the Polyzena and the Remus.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And look, being able to
look at it and decide,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, we got we're
going to land here

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to land here.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they determine
where they were going to land.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.260 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
land in flat areas

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
on the dark side of the moon
and they were going to be apart.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to be at
least three kilometers away

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.185 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to land
in the same location

00:22:29.185 --> 00:22:34.095 align:middle line:84%
just in case something happened
or they encountered something.

00:22:34.095 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
find anything else

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:90%
interesting in those photos?

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They found anomalies.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Anomalies.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, remember, our
satellite photography system

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the greatest in
the world back then,

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.870 align:middle line:90%
but they did see some anomalies.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So they-- the mission,
Polyzena was launched first.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They waited for that to
get into orbit on its way.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Then the Remus was
launched and they went.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And it took them about five
hours both to get there.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
They circled, determined
where the place--

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:90%
best place to land.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And here's where the
first problem developed

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
with the Polyzena,
was they were trying

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
to get it to land in
a certain location,

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
but it landed where
it wanted to land,

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't where
they wanted to land.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:90%
So they landed.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Some time later,
the Remus came in.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
The Remus landed where
it wanted to land,

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:90%
but now they were farther apart.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
They were almost five
kilometers apart.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
You're talking three
miles or so apart.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're not in close
proximity to each other.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.046 align:middle line:90%
They had ground communications.

00:23:45.046 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did that alarm
them that this craft

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:84%
is all of a sudden making
a conscious decision

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:84%
not to land where
they wanted to land?

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, they were
very, very concerned by it.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And then when they got on
the surface of the moon,

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:84%
they had problems
opening the doors,

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and they realized why, because
inside was a positive pressure.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And now they had
to turn that off

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
know how to do it.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So it took them some time
to figure it all out.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But I guess they did
because the doors opened,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
the soldiers exited
the 30 and one.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And then Remus, of course,
was three miles away,

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying
to communicate.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
They finally did
communicate with him.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And Remus was having problems,
too, with a number of things.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:90%
They were landed in a crater.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So the Polyzena
troops couldn't see.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.493 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing obstructing
them on the moon, of course.

00:24:39.493 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't see the
Remus because they

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:90%
were below the ground level.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So when the soldiers got out and
spread out, started searching,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
they found buildings,
structures, caves, towers,

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
which led them to believe
there was a civilization there.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So now the soldiers are
on heightened alert.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, we found structures.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Is there a civilization here?

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:90%
Moon people?

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
There weren't quite
sure what to do.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
The commander was
an Army Colonel,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and he was the
commander of both units.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But remember, there's
only one team here.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The other team is
three miles away,

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're not sure what
they're encountering over there.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So this commander decided, you
know what we're going to do?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to
do the other team,

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
team up, a strength in numbers,
typical military tactics.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they did.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And they met up and
they conversed, and then

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:84%
they all moved together back
to where the buildings were.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, where the Remus
landed, there wasn't they

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't find any buildings, they
didn't find any structures.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So when they moved back
to where the Polyzena was,

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
they started spreading
out and looking.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:10%
And they found these
caves, and they decided

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:10%
to send teams into the caves.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:10%
The caves were enormous.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:90%
They went all over the place.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But remember, compasses
didn't work on the moon.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Any time you are trying
to navigate in a combat

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
environment, you want
compasses, you want to navigate,

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.090 align:middle line:84%
you want to know
where you're going.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Nothing worked.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so they
decided they're

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:90%
going to get lost down there.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So they decided not
to explore the caves.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
They came back up.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They took a lot of
pictures of this area.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:84%
They didn't find any
extraterrestrials at first.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't anything there.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And it appeared
that these buildings

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
had been there for a long,
long, long, long time.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:90%
So this concerned them.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, was it in just this area
or all over the dark side?

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, they know that
where the Remus landed,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
three miles in a
different direction,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:90%
there wasn't any buildings.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.790 align:middle line:90%
They didn't find anything there.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
What about farther to
the opposite direction?

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So they did do some
recon that way,

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing
they could find in

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:90%
that other area were towers.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And there were strange
looking towers.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't appear
to be man-made,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:84%
but they did have
something on top, which

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:90%
was similar to an antenna.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But they were unlike
any other structure,

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:90%
natural structure on the moon.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.120 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't like a rock
formation or anything else,

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
so they figured it was something
that the civilization had made

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.725 align:middle line:90%
for some particular purpose.

00:27:29.725 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how were the
communications maintained

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:90%
for Earth and on the planet?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, remember, we
had two satellites orbiting

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that were launched by the STS,
and so they could communicate,

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
the ground forces
communicate through them.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the things they had
each team, 30-man team,

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:90%
they had a radio system.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:84%
They had a radio system
that worked because there

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:90%
was no interference on it.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It was similar to a
walkie talkie radio,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:90%
but it was more advanced.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
communicating.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They could communicate
back and forth.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And they also could use
another form of communication,

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
another device to communicate
with the satellite that

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
could relay the
messages back to Earth.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was like a
three or four second delay.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But when the communications
are radio operator-- remember,

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.320 align:middle line:84%
every team, always
military teams

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:90%
always have radio operators.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
When the radio operator
was looking at this radio,

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.170 align:middle line:84%
he noticed a stray
signal was pinging.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And he told the
commander, there's

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:84%
a signal coming from
someplace around here.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they started figuring
out, trying to figure out,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, now it was not us.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else has been--

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.790 align:middle line:84%
at least no humans
have been on this side.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Where's this
communication coming from?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So now they started
looking at it.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you
can do is triangulate.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.560 align:middle line:84%
They found a location in
one of these buildings.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:10%
It was a human--

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:10%
it looked like a human made
building or a creature, whatever

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.023 align:middle line:10%
creatures these were that
had a base on the moon,

00:29:04.023 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:10%
but they couldn't figure
out how to get in it.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But this signal was
coming from that.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So now they figured then that at
least the Polyzena was homing in

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
on that signal and that's
why it landed there.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so now
they figured, OK,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:84%
maybe this craft has
been near here before,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and whatever civilization
that created these buildings

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:84%
on the dark side of the moon,
that this is were their craft.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So the team commander,
they had some equipment.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's dig in to see if we
can get into this building,

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.700 align:middle line:84%
because maybe we'll just
find a civilization here.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how big was
this building, Rick,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and what was it made out of?

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.275 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The building
was made out

00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:84%
of some kind of substance,
a hard metal substance.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It's about hundred feet by
hundred feet, I think he said.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Square, partially embedded
into the lunar soil and a part

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:03.520 align:middle line:90%
above ground.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:84%
But there were no
windows, doors.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So they tried their best
to try to dig in under it,

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.230 align:middle line:84%
but they realized this thing
probably went down deeper.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So they decided that
wasn't feasible.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So they decided then that
the commander decided,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.015 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the
time we have to leave.

00:30:25.015 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
events can you

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:84%
tell us about that
happened right after that?

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: When they started
gathering up equipment

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and remember, the other team
had to go back to the Remus

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
three miles away, and they were
going to leave some items there,

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
some receiver systems,
some kind of radio relays

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:84%
or something to
that effect there.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And they did that.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And now the other
team had to go over

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and do that on the other side.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Just as they were
doing this, they

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:84%
noticed there was
something in the air that

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.215 align:middle line:90%
was just above their head.

00:30:57.215 --> 00:30:58.015 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:30:58.015 --> 00:30:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And they
realized at that point

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:04.300 align:middle line:84%
it was a UFO, another
extraterrestrial craft.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:90%
And, oh, my God.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:84%
We got maybe the civilization
that lives here is coming back

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:90%
and now we're here.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.470 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Awkward.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.145 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Is there going
to be a confrontation.

00:31:17.145 --> 00:31:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, we-- we didn't
have-- that team

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
didn't have anything other than
a couple of lasers and some air

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:90%
guns.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't confront another
extraterrestrial civilization.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So the consensus was, we
got to get out of here.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But they had to wait for the
30-person team to get back

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:90%
to the Remus.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And while they were waiting
and while the other team

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.752 align:middle line:84%
was getting inside the Polyzena,
this craft started to land.

00:31:47.752 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't going to
land where they were at.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.995 align:middle line:84%
It was going to land farther
away from them to the North,

00:31:52.995 --> 00:31:54.120 align:middle line:90%
I think they said, of that.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.827 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was this
a similar craft?

00:31:55.827 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:90%
What it looked like?

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It was never explained.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It was another craft
that was quite big

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and it had a really bright
beam shining down on the moon

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.290 align:middle line:84%
as if it was either
searching for something

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
or detecting something, maybe
some kind of a recon system.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.327 align:middle line:84%
So they had to wait, and it
and it took them some time

00:32:20.327 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:84%
for the other team to
get back to the Remus,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
get inside and so forth.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, they were
now they were afraid if they

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:90%
took off, what happens now?

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the Polyzena told
the Remus to take off first.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Get out of here.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:90%
And they did, and took off.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:84%
The UFO stayed right above it,
right above this, the Polyzena.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So that probably
means that craft

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
knew what this Polyzena craft
was probably the same species.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:90%
They think that.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.960 align:middle line:84%
They could never
figure that out.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.610 align:middle line:84%
The Remus took off,
headed back towards Earth.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Polyzena figured, OK, now
we're going to take off

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to move
away from this other craft,

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and then take off
and get out of there.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Polyzena did take off.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The alien, extraterrestrial
craft remained where it was.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Didn't come after him at first.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But the Polyzena took
off in a different manner

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:84%
or a different direction,
I think, he said,

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:90%
then they came in.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So now what was going out in
space rather than trying--

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.530 align:middle line:84%
rather than moving
towards Earth.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now the pilot's realizing
that they're not

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:90%
going where they wanted to go.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly they
realized this other craft

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:90%
was in front of them.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.677 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:33:45.677 --> 00:33:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Are they communicating?

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
The crafts might
be communicating.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.183 align:middle line:90%
That's what I meant.

00:33:51.183 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But, yeah,
the pilots don't--

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:90%
don't know that.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But the pilots--
the one pilot will

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
swear that other one
realized it was in trouble

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:90%
and directed it towards Earth.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.352 align:middle line:84%
But others say
no, I don't think,

00:34:07.352 --> 00:34:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I think the craft figured it--

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:84%
it was off course
and made it back.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But both crafts made
it back to Earth,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
landed at the same location,
took them a lot longer

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.949 align:middle line:90%
and they made it back safe.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at that
point, then they're

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.190 align:middle line:84%
going to have to assess the
health of each one of the people

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.194 align:middle line:90%
on board and so forth.

00:34:28.194 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How has Operation
Sapphire Selene influenced,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.045 align:middle line:84%
like, other lunar missions
and landings in the future?

00:34:34.045 --> 00:34:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, after that mission
of the Polyzena and the Remus,

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.736 align:middle line:90%
we didn't go back to the moon.

00:34:44.736 --> 00:34:45.639 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Is this the so-called case we
were not allowed to come back?

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.605 align:middle line:84%
Was there any
communication there?

00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:54.239 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think there's a lot
more to this once we got back.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Once they did more an analysis
of these two crafts, which we

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.510 align:middle line:90%
still have, we still fly them.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:84%
We know a lot more
about them than before.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:09.045 align:middle line:84%
There's rumors that J. Rod might
have helped us on one of them.

00:35:09.045 --> 00:35:09.845 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Well.

00:35:09.845 --> 00:35:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: These are
rumors that I--

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I just heard-- I don't
know anything for sure.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we learned
a lot about the dark side

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.645 align:middle line:84%
And I think the consensus
was, we can't go back there.

00:35:24.645 --> 00:35:25.445 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:35:25.445 --> 00:35:28.128 align:middle line:84%
Was there a follow up
investigation then, Rick,

00:35:28.128 --> 00:35:29.295 align:middle line:90%
to come to some conclusions?

00:35:29.295 --> 00:35:30.095 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we left some
devices in that area.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:90%
We left two devices.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.290 align:middle line:84%
There are satellite
devices where

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:44.090 align:middle line:84%
we could turn them on and
communicate or search that area.

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.802 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we still had
two satellites circling.

00:35:47.802 --> 00:35:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were not
sophisticated satellites,

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.520 align:middle line:90%
but they were satellites.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And what these things found,
the satellites and the sensors,

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:84%
a lot of activity on the
dark side of the moon.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person is explaining
this to me was one of the pilots

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and one of the technicians,
Air Force technicians

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.660 align:middle line:90%
that went on this mission.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:84%
He said that what they
found were activity.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:90%
What kind of activities?

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Ground movements, air
movements of air assets,

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:23.960 align:middle line:90%
he referred to them as.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And anybody in
the military knows

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:84%
air assets is different
types of flying devices.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.350 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
things detected.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the consensus
was until we

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:42.050 align:middle line:84%
were in a better technologically
advanced state on Earth

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:46.430 align:middle line:84%
where we could go back there
with appropriate defensive

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms to encounter
anything, any extraterrestrials,

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.302 align:middle line:84%
the leaders decided we're
not going to go back there.

00:36:55.302 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Is it
possible these craft

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.750 align:middle line:10%
were sent by these beings
or this race on planet Earth

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.570 align:middle line:10%
to actually for us
to scientifically

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.915 align:middle line:10%
explore that and go to the moon?

00:37:05.915 --> 00:37:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, I think that--

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
questions I had was,

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, they found this Polyzena
in the middle of the desert

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.920 align:middle line:90%
near a mine.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.910 align:middle line:90%
These miners find it.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.415 align:middle line:84%
There's no
extraterrestrials around.

00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uninhabited.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's not damaged.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:90%
So we get it and bring it back.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Is it a calling card?

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, here-- hey, Earth,
here's our craft.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
All you got to do
is learn to fly it.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Come on up and meet
us up on the moon.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's very possible.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.958 align:middle line:84%
I think it is, although I've
never heard it from anybody in--

00:37:37.958 --> 00:37:39.125 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It feels like that.

00:37:39.125 --> 00:37:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --in leadership
role, but I actually think

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.695 align:middle line:84%
that's probably
the case, because--

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why would
they leave it?

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly, exactly.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Why would they leave a
highly sophisticated craft

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.710 align:middle line:84%
on this planet with no
extraterrestrials aboard?

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
They certainly couldn't,
I'll leave a manual

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:84%
how to operate it
because we wouldn't

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.090 align:middle line:90%
understand their language.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think they left it
hoping that at some point

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.480 align:middle line:84%
in our history or
technological history,

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:84%
we'll learn how
to fly this thing

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.780 align:middle line:90%
and come visit them on the moon.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.785 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And we did.

00:38:13.785 --> 00:38:14.685 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And we did.

00:38:14.685 --> 00:38:17.408 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Rick, that
was a fascinating story.

00:38:17.408 --> 00:38:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
you coming on the show.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.440 align:middle line:84%
